Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` flattens a nested list structure by recursively processing each element. The provided code and output hints confirm that the function works as intended, handling various levels of nesting and including all integers in the flattened list. The function does not modify the input list but instead creates and returns a new flattened list, which aligns with the problem description. The assertions provided in the output hints demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for multiple test cases, including edge cases like empty lists or lists containing only integers. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains accurate.
