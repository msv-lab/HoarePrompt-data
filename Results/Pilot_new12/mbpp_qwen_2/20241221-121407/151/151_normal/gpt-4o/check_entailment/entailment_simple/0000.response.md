Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality required to flatten a given nested list structure. Here's why:

1. **Recursive Structure**: The function `func_1` is defined recursively, which is essential for handling nested lists of arbitrary depth. For each item in the input list `nested_list`, the function checks whether the item is itself a list using `isinstance(item, list)`. If it is, the function calls itself with this sublist (`func_1(item)`) and extends the current `flat_list` with the result of this recursive call. If the item is not a list, it is simply appended to `flat_list`.

2. **Base Case**: When the input is an integer (not a list), it is added directly to `flat_list`. This ensures that the function handles both integers and nested lists correctly.

3. **Combining Results**: The use of `extend` ensures that all elements from the nested sublists are added to `flat_list`, effectively flattening the entire structure.

4. **Consistency with Problem Description**: The function processes each element of the input list `nested_list`, ensuring that all integers from nested structures are included in the final, flattened list. It handles nested lists of any depth and any combination of integers and nested lists.

5. **Validation Assumption**: Since the problem statement specifies that the input will be valid, the program is designed to work under these assumptions without needing additional error handling for invalid inputs.

Given these points, the program consistently flattens the nested list as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
