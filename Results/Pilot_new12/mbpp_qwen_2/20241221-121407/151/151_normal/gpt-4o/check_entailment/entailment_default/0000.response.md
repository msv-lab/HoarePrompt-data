Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code for the function `func_1` appears to correctly flatten a given nested list structure. The function recursively processes each element of the input list. If an element is a list, it calls itself on that sublist to further flatten it. If an element is an integer, it appends it directly to the `flat_list`. The output hints confirm that the function flattens the list correctly, handling any depth of nesting and including all integers, even if they are deeply nested.

Given the assertions and the problem description, the function seems to meet the requirements for all potential cases. The code does not modify the original list and creates a new flattened list, which is consistent with the problem description. There are no edge cases mentioned in the hints that would cause the function to fail, and the provided examples also demonstrate its correctness. Therefore, the program is correct.
