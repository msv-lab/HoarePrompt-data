Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly flattens a nested list structure into a single list containing all integers. The function `func_1` uses recursion to handle any level of nesting. For each element in the input list, if the element is a list, the function calls itself recursively to flatten that sublist. If the element is an integer, it appends it directly to the `flat_list`. This approach ensures that all integers from the nested list are included in the flattened list, regardless of their original nesting level. The code handles various cases, including empty lists and lists containing only integers. Since the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem, the correctness is **True**.
