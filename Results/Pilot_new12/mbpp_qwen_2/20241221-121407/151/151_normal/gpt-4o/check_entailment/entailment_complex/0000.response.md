Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly flattens a nested list structure into a single list containing all integers. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Recursive Nature**: The function `func_1` checks each item in the `nested_list`. If the item is a list, it recursively calls itself to process that sublist, ensuring that all nested elements are eventually flattened.
   
2. **Base Case Handling**: If the item is not a list (i.e., it's an integer), it is directly appended to `flat_list`.

3. **Flattening Mechanism**: By using `extend` when processing nested lists, the function ensures that all elements are added to `flat_list` without creating additional sublists, effectively flattening the entire structure.

4. **Edge Cases Considered**: 
   - An empty `nested_list` will result in an empty `flat_list`.
   - A `nested_list` containing only integers will remain unchanged.
   - Deeper levels of nesting are handled correctly due to the recursive nature of the function.

Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases, the program is correct.
