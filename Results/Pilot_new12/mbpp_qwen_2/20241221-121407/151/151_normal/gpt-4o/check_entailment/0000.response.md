Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively extending the flat list with elements from sublists. This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their depth within the nested structure, are included in the final flat list. Given the assertions provided, the function works correctly for the examples shown, and no other potential edge cases were found where the function would fail to meet the problem description.
