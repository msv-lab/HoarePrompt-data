Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively extending the `flat_list` with elements from sublists. The function handles both direct integer values and nested lists, ensuring that all elements are flattened into a single list. Given the examples provided and the recursive nature of the function, it appears to work correctly for all potential cases. No edge cases or specific inputs were found that would make the function behave incorrectly based on the problem description.
