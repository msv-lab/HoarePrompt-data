Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. For a given tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function `func_1` generates a new tuple of length `N` where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. 

Let's verify this by considering a few examples:

1. Input: `(1, 2, 3)`
   - Output: `(2, 6)` because `1*2 = 2` and `2*3 = 6`.
   
2. Input: `(4, 5, 6, 7)`
   - Output: `(20, 30, 42)` because `4*5 = 20`, `5*6 = 30`, and `6*7 = 42`.

The program uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to compute the products of consecutive pairs of elements in the input tuple. This approach works correctly for any tuple of numbers, including edge cases such as tuples with only two elements or tuples with negative numbers.

Since the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
