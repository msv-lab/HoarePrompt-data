Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Given a tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function `func_1` returns a new tuple where each element is the product of the corresponding element from the input tuple and the next element (shifted by one position to the right). This process is correctly applied to all elements except the last one, which does not have a corresponding right neighbor and hence is excluded from the result.

The output hints confirm that the function iterates through the input tuple and multiplies each element with the next element, producing the correct results for all valid inputs. There are no potential cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements as long as the input is a valid tuple of numbers with a length of at least 2. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
