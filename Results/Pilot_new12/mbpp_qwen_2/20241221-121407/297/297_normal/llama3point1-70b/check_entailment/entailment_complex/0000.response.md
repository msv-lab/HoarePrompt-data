Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description states that the input should be a tuple of numbers with a length of \(N+1\), where \(N\) is a positive integer. The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a tuple. We assume the input is valid based on the problem description.

2. **Computation Logic**: The function uses the `zip` function to pair each element in the input tuple with the subsequent element (right-shifted version). The generator expression `a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` computes the product of each pair. The resulting generator is then converted into a tuple using the `tuple` constructor.

3. **Output**: The output is a tuple of length \(N\), where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from the input tuple and its right-shifted version. This precisely matches the requirement stated in the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
