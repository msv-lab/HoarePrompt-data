Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes the product of consecutive elements in the input tuple. Specifically, the annotation states that the program returns a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from the input tuple `numbers` and its right-shifted version (`numbers[1:]`). This matches the problem description, which requires a function that takes a tuple of numbers `(t_1,...,t_{N+1})` and returns a tuple of length `N` where the `i`-th element is `t_i * t_{i+1}`. The provided code and annotations clearly show that the function behaves as intended, and there is no evidence from the annotated version that suggests any deviation from this behavior.
