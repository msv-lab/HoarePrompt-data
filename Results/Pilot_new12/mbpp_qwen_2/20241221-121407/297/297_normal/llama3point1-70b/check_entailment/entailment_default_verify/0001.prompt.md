You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. This matches the problem description perfectly. For any tuple `(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its successor, and then multiplies them together using a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all valid input tuples, including edge cases such as tuples with only one element (where the function would simply return an empty tuple) and tuples with two elements (where the output would be a single-element tuple containing their product). Therefore, the function appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `numbers` of integers or floats with a specific length `N+1`, where `N` is a positive integer. It returns a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from `numbers` and its right-shifted version. Specifically, the function iterates through the input tuple and for each element, multiplies it with the next element (right-shifted version). This process is performed for all elements except the last one, which does not have a corresponding right neighbor. If the input tuple is empty or contains only one element, the function will return an empty tuple since there are no elements to shift or multiply.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
