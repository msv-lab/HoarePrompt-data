Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the described functionality. For a given tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function `func_1` returns a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element is the product of `t_i` and `t_{i+1}`. The code uses a generator expression within `zip` to pair each element with its right neighbor and then converts the result to a tuple using `tuple()`. This approach handles all cases as specified in the problem description, including the case where the input tuple has a length of 2 (which would result in an empty tuple being returned), and it does not handle invalid inputs since the problem statement assumes valid input.
