Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. This matches the problem description perfectly. For any tuple `(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its successor, and then multiplies them together using a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all valid input tuples, including edge cases such as tuples with only one element (where the function would simply return an empty tuple) and tuples with two elements (where the output would be a single-element tuple containing their product). Therefore, the function appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
