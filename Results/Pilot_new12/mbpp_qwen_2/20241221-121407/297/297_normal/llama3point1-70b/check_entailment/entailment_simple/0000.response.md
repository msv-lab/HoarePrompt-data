Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes the input will be valid and of the correct type (a tuple of numbers with length \(N+1\)). Since we are instructed to assume the input is valid, the program does not need to handle invalid inputs explicitly.

2. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple `numbers` as input. It then uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple. Each element in the new tuple is the product of the i-th element and the (i+1)-th element from the input tuple `numbers`.

   - `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`: This creates pairs of consecutive elements from the input tuple.
   - `a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])`: This generates the products of these pairs.
   - `tuple(...)`: This converts the generator expression into a tuple.

3. **Output Validation**: The output is a tuple of length \(N\) where each element is the product of the corresponding elements from the input tuple and its right-shifted version. This exactly matches the requirement stated in the problem description.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the specified functionality for all valid inputs, and hence the correctness is **True**.
