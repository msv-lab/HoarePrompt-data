The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a tuple of integers or floats, and the length of `numbers` is `N+1`, where `N` is a positive integer. The function returns a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from the input tuple `numbers` and its right-shifted version.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `numbers` of integers or floats with a specific length and return a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from `numbers` and its right-shifted version.
