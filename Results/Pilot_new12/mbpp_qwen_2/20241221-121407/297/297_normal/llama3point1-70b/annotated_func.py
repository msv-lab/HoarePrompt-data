#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a tuple of integers or floats, and the length of numbers is N+1, where N is a positive integer.
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from the input tuple `numbers` and its right-shifted version
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `numbers` of integers or floats with a specific length `N+1`, where `N` is a positive integer. It returns a tuple where each element is the product of corresponding elements from `numbers` and its right-shifted version. Specifically, the function iterates through the input tuple and for each element, multiplies it with the next element (right-shifted version). This process is performed for all elements except the last one, which does not have a corresponding right neighbor. If the input tuple is empty or contains only one element, the function will return an empty tuple since there are no elements to shift or multiply.
