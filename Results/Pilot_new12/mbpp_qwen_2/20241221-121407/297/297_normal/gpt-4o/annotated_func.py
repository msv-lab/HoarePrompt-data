#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers (integers or floats) with length N+1, where N is a positive integer.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple `t`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` containing numbers (integers or floats) with a length of \(N+1\), where \(N\) is a positive integer. It returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple `t`. Specifically, the \(i\)-th element of the returned tuple is the product of `t[i]` and `t[i+1]` for \(0 \leq i < N\). If the input tuple `t` has only one element, the function will raise an `IndexError` because the range `range(len(t) - 1)` would be empty, leading to no elements to process. Therefore, the function should handle this edge case by either raising an error or returning an appropriate value when the tuple has only one element.
