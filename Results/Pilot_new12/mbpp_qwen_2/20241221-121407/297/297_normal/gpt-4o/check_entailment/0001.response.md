Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function works as expected for the given test cases and handles tuples of different lengths, including a tuple with only one element, which results in an empty tuple as specified. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided assertions and reasoning.
