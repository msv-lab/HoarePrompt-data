Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and works as expected for the given test cases. However, the output hints reveal an important edge case that was not handled in the provided function: when the input tuple `t` contains only one element. In such a case, the function `func_1` will raise an `IndexError` because the range `range(len(t) - 1)` would be empty, leading to no elements to process. This issue is not addressed in the original assessment, and the function should either handle this edge case by raising an appropriate error or returning an empty tuple if the input tuple has only one element. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program needs to be corrected to handle this edge case.
