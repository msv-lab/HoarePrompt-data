Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided function `func_1` seems to work correctly for the given test cases, the original assessment did not consider the edge case where the input tuple contains only one element. According to the output hints, if the input tuple has only one element, the function will raise an `IndexError` because the range `range(len(t) - 1)` would be empty. This means the function does not handle this scenario appropriately. Therefore, the function does not fully meet the requirements as specified in the problem description, which should include handling such edge cases. Hence, the final assessment is **False**.
