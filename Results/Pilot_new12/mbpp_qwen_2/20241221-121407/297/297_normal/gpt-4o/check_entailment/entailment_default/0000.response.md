Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not handle the case when the input tuple has only one element. According to the problem description, the function should return an empty tuple if the input tuple has only one element. However, the current implementation will raise an `IndexError` because `range(len(t) - 1)` will be empty, leading to no elements to process. The output hints confirm this issue, stating that the function should handle the case when the tuple has only one element appropriately. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
