Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. For each input tuple, it returns a new tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function works as expected for all the provided test cases and there are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases.
