Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `t` as input.
2. It uses a generator expression inside the `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple. For each index `i` from `0` to `len(t) - 2`, it multiplies the `i`-th element `t[i]` with the `(i + 1)`-th element `t[i + 1]`.
3. The resulting tuple has a length of `N`, where `N` is one less than the length of the input tuple `t`.

The provided test cases validate the function against different inputs:
- When the input tuple has more than two elements, like `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the output is a tuple of length 4 where each element is the product of consecutive elements.
- When the input tuple has exactly two elements, like `(2, 4)`, the output is a single-element tuple containing their product.
- When the input tuple has three elements, like `(12, 13, 14)`, the output is a two-element tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements.

The program adheres to the problem description and produces the expected output for all given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
