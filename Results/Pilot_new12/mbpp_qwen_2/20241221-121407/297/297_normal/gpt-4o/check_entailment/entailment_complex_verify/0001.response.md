Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment suggests that the function `func_1` is correct, but upon closer inspection using the annotated version of the code, we find that the function does not handle the case where the input tuple has only one element correctly. When the input tuple has only one element, the function raises an `IndexError` because the range `range(len(t) - 1)` is empty, leading to no elements to process. According to the problem description, for a tuple with only one element, the function should return an empty tuple. However, the current implementation does not account for this scenario, resulting in an error. Therefore, the function is not fully correct based on the problem description.
