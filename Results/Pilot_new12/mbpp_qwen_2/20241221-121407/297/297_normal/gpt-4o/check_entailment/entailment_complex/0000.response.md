Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. For a given tuple `t` of length \(N+1\), the function returns a new tuple of length \(N\) where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple `t`. Specifically:

- The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the tuple `t` up to `len(t) - 1`, ensuring that each element in the output tuple is the product of `t[i]` and `t[i+1]`.
- The condition `len(t) - 1` ensures that the function processes all pairs of consecutive elements in the tuple, stopping just before the last element.
- When the input tuple has only one element, the function correctly returns an empty tuple because the range `range(len(t) - 1)` would be empty.

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for tuples of various lengths and values. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
