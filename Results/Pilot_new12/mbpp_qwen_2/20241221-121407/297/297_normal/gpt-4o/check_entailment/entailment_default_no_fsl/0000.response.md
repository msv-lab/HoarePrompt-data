Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case when the input tuple has only one element. According to the problem description, if the input tuple has only one element, the function should either raise an error or return an appropriate value. However, the current implementation of the function will raise an `IndexError` because `range(len(t) - 1)` will be empty when `len(t) == 1`. This means that the function does not work correctly for tuples with a single element, which violates the requirements specified in the problem description.
