The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It first finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` is not found in `s` (both indices are -1), it returns `s` unchanged. If `ch` is found one or more times, it returns `s` with all occurrences of `ch` removed. This is achieved by constructing a new string that excludes the characters at the first and last indices where `ch` appears, along with any characters between them.
