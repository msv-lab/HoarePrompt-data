`last_index` is assigned the value of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` using the `rfind` method. If `ch` is not found in `s`, `last_index` will be `-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
