The code `first_index = s.find(ch)` assigns the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s` to the variable `first_index`. The value of `s` and `ch` remains unchanged. The `find` method returns `-1` if the substring `ch` is not found in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
