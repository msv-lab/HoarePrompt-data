The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` (a string) and `ch` (a single character string). 

- If `ch` is not found in `s`, both `first_index` and `last_index` are -1, indicating that `ch` does not occur in `s`. In this case, the function returns `s`.
- If `ch` occurs at most once in `s`, `first_index` and `last_index` are equal, and the function returns `s`.
- If `ch` occurs more than once in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with all occurrences of `ch` removed.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and return the string `s` either unchanged if `ch` is not found or removed from `s` if `ch` is present one or more times.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. If `ch` is not found in `s`, it returns `s`. If `ch` is found in `s` one or more times, it returns `s` with all occurrences of `ch` removed.**
