Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It first finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` is not found in `s` (both indices are -1), it returns `s` unchanged. If `ch` is found one or more times, it returns `s` with all occurrences of `ch` removed. This is achieved by constructing a new string that excludes the characters at the first and last indices where `ch` appears, along with any characters between them.**

**Edge cases and missing functionality included:**
- If `ch` only occurs at the beginning of `s`, the function correctly removes all occurrences of `ch`.
- If `ch` only occurs at the end of `s`, the function also correctly removes all occurrences of `ch`.
- If `ch` occurs multiple times within `s`, the function correctly removes all occurrences of `ch`, ensuring that no part of `ch` remains in the returned string.
- If `ch` is not found in `s` (i.e., both `first_index` and `last_index` are -1), the function correctly returns `s` unchanged.
