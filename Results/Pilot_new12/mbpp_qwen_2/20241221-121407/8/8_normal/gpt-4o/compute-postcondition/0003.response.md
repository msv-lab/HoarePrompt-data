Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. Either `first_index` and `last_index` are both -1, or they are equal, indicating that `ch` occurs at most once in `s`. The program returns `s`**.
