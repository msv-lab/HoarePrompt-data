Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string in all tested cases. The annotated version confirms that the function handles edge cases such as strings with multiple occurrences of the character, strings with only one occurrence of the character, strings with no occurrences of the character, empty strings, and single character strings. The logic within the function ensures that the first and last occurrences of the character are removed while preserving other characters in between. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
