Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. It removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

- The function `func_1` takes a string `s` and a character `ch`.
- It finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of `ch` using `find` and `rfind`.
- If `ch` is not found (`first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`), or if both indices are the same, it returns the original string `s`.
- Otherwise, it constructs a new string by concatenating parts of the original string, effectively removing the first and last occurrences of `ch`.

Given the assertions and the output hints, the code handles various cases correctly, including strings where `ch` appears multiple times, once, or not at all. There are no obvious edge cases or examples provided that would make the program incorrect based on the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
