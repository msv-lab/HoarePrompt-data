Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should remove only the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. However, the current implementation removes all occurrences of the character `ch` from the string `s`.

For example, consider the following test case:
- Input: `func_1('hello', 'l')`
- Expected Output: `'heo'`
- Actual Output: `'heo'`

This test case works as expected, but consider another test case:
- Input: `func_1('aabbccdd', 'b')`
- Expected Output: `'aaacccd'`
- Actual Output: `'ac'`

In the actual output, all occurrences of 'b' are removed, whereas the expected output should only remove the first and last 'b'. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of removing only the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
