Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. The annotations support the correctness of the program as they describe the state of the program at different points and confirm that the function behaves as expected. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles all the provided test cases correctly, and the annotated version confirms that the logic inside the function is sound.
