Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string. The annotations support this by detailing the state of the program at various points and explaining how the function handles different scenarios. Specifically, the function checks for the presence and positions of the character in the string and constructs a new string excluding the specified characters. The provided test cases (`assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'`, `assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'`, `assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'`) also validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
