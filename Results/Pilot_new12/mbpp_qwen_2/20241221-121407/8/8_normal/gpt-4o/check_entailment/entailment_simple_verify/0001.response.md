Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string. The annotated version supports this correctness by detailing the state of the program at different points. For each assertion, the function behaves as expected:

1. `func_1('hello', 'l')` returns `'heo'` because it removes the first 'l' at index 2 and the last 'l' at index 4.
2. `func_1('abcda', 'a')` returns `'bcd'` because it removes the first 'a' at index 3 and the last 'a' at index 0.
3. `func_1('PHP', 'P')` returns `'H'` because it removes the first 'P' at index 0 and the last 'P' at index 2.

Additionally, the function handles edge cases correctly, such as when the character is not found in the string or when the first and last indices are the same. The annotated version confirms that these cases are appropriately managed by returning the original string `s`. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program meets the problem description.
