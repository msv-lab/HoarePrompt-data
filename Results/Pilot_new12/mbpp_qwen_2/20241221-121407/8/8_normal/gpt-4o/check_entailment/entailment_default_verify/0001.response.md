Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string, as demonstrated by the test cases. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling cases where the character is not found, the first and last indices are the same, and multiple occurrences of the character. The function constructs a new string that excludes the characters at the first and last indices where the character appears, along with any characters between them. Since the function meets the problem description and the provided test cases and output hints validate its correctness, the original assessment is maintained.
