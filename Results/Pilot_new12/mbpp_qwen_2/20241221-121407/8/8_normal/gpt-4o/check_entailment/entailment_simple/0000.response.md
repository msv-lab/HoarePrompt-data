Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. If the character appears multiple times, only the first and last occurrences should be removed. If the character does not appear at all or only appears once, the original string should be returned unchanged.

2. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a character `ch`.
   - It uses `s.find(ch)` to find the first occurrence of `ch` and `s.rfind(ch)` to find the last occurrence of `ch`.
   - The `if` condition checks if the first index (`first_index`) is `-1`, the last index (`last_index`) is `-1`, or if both indices are the same (`first_index == last_index`). In these cases, the function simply returns the original string `s`.
   - If the above conditions are not met, it constructs a new string by removing the characters at the first and last indices of `ch` in `s`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'`: The first and last occurrences of 'l' are removed, resulting in 'heo'.
   - `assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'`: The first occurrence of 'a' is at index 0 and the last occurrence is at index 3. Removing these results in 'bcd'.
   - `assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'`: The first and only occurrence of 'P' is at index 0 and the last occurrence is also at index 2. Removing these results in 'H'.

Given that the program handles all edge cases (such as when the character is not present in the string or when it appears only once) and performs the required operation correctly, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
