Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the requirement to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. It handles cases where the character is not found in the string by returning the original string. Additionally, it correctly constructs a new string by excluding the characters at the first and last indices where the character appears, along with any characters between them. The examples provided in the output hints also match the behavior of the code, ensuring that the implementation is correct for every potential case described.
