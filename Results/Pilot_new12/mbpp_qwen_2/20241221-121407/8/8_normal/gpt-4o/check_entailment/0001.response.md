Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from the string, as per the problem description. Let's verify this with a few test cases:

1. `func_1('hello', 'l')` returns `'heo'`, which is correct because the first 'l' at index 2 and the last 'l' at index 4 are removed.
2. `func_1('abcda', 'a')` returns `'bcd'`, which is correct because the first 'a' at index 3 and the last 'a' at index 0 are removed.
3. `func_1('PHP', 'P')` returns `'H'`, which is correct because the first 'P' at index 0 and the last 'P' at index 2 are removed.

The function handles all the test cases correctly. Additionally, it also handles cases where the character is not found in the string or the first and last indices are the same (e.g., `func_1('a', 'a')` returns `'`'`). Therefore, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
