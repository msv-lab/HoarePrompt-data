Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. The output hints align with the functionality of the program. The program handles various cases correctly, including strings with multiple occurrences of the character, strings with only one occurrence of the character, strings with no occurrences of the character, empty strings, and single-character strings. The logic of finding the first and last indices of the character and constructing the new string without those characters is sound and matches the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
