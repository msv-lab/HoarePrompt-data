Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. The output hints provided also align with the functionality demonstrated in the original assessment. Specifically, the function handles cases where the character appears multiple times, once, or not at all, and behaves as expected in each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided hints.
