Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Finding Occurrences:**
   - `first_occurrence = s.find(char)` finds the index of the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.
   - `last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)` finds the index of the last occurrence of `char` in the string `s`.

2. **Handling Cases:**
   - **Case 1:** Both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are found (`!= -1`).
     - If the first and last occurrences of `char` are at the same index (`first_occurrence == last_occurrence`), the function removes the first occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. This effectively removes only the first occurrence because the replacement limit is set to 1.
     - If the first and last occurrences are at different indices, the function constructs a new string by concatenating parts of `s` around the specified range: `s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]`. This removes both the first and last occurrences of `char`.
   - **Case 2:** Either `first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is not found (`== -1`).
     - In this case, the function simply returns the original string `s`.

The logic handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
