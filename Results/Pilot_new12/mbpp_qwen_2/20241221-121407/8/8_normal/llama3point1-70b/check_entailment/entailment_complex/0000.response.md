Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program adheres to the requirements:

1. **Single Occurrence of `char`:**
   - When `char` appears exactly once in the string `s`, the function uses `replace(char, '', 1)` to remove the first (and only) occurrence of `char`. This matches the requirement to remove the first occurrence of the given character.

2. **Multiple Occurrences of `char`:**
   - When `char` appears more than once in the string `s`, the function constructs a new string by slicing and concatenating parts of `s` to remove both the first and last occurrences of `char`. Specifically:
     - `s[:first_occurrence]` takes the part of the string before the first occurrence.
     - `s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence]` takes the part between the first and last occurrences.
     - `s[last_occurrence + 1:]` takes the part after the last occurrence.
   - This approach ensures that both the first and last occurrences of `char` are removed, as required.

3. **No Occurrence of `char`:**
   - If `char` does not appear in the string `s`, the function simply returns the original string `s`. This handles the case where no modifications are needed.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the specified behavior for all potential cases, making it correct according to the problem description.
