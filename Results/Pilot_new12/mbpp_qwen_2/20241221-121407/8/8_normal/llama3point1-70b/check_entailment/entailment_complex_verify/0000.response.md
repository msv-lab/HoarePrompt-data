Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly handles all the specified cases:
1. When the character appears multiple times, it removes both the first and last occurrences.
2. When the character appears only once, it removes that single occurrence.
3. When the character does not appear at all, it returns the original string.
4. When the string is empty, it returns an empty string.

The annotations align with the problem description and the original assessment, indicating that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
