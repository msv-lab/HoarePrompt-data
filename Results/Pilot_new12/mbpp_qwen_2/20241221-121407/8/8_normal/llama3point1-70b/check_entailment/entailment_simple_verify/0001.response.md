Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. 

- If the character is not found in the string (`first_occurrence` or `last_occurrence` is `-1`), the function returns the original string.
- If the character is found only once, the function correctly removes the single occurrence using `replace`.
- If the character is found multiple times, the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences by slicing the string appropriately.

The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
