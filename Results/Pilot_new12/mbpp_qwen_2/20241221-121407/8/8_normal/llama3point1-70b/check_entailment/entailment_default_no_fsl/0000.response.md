Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the requirement to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. Let's verify this against the problem description and output hints:

1. **Single Occurrence Case**: The code correctly handles the scenario where `char` appears exactly once in `s`. It removes the single occurrence and returns the modified string.
2. **Multiple Occurrences Case**: The code correctly identifies the first and last occurrences of `char` and removes both, ensuring the first and last instances are removed.
3. **No Occurrence Case**: If `char` does not appear in `s`, the code returns the original string `s`, which matches the requirement.

The logic within the function is consistent with the problem description and the output hints provided. There are no cases mentioned in the hints or described in the problem where the code would fail to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
