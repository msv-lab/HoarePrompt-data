Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string in all potential cases:

1. If the character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string.
2. If the character is found only once, the function correctly removes the single occurrence.
3. If the character is found multiple times, the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly, there is no potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
