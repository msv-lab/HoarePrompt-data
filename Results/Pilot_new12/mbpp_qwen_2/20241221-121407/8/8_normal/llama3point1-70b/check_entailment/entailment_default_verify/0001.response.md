Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly handles all the described cases:
1. If the character is not found in the string, it returns the original string.
2. If the character is found only once, it removes that single occurrence.
3. If the character is found multiple times, it removes the first and last occurrences.

The output hints also align with the provided code, confirming that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
