Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **First and Last Occurrence Removal**:
   - The function finds the first occurrence of the character using `s.find(char)` and the last occurrence using `s.rfind(char)`.
   - If both occurrences are found (`first_occurrence != -1` and `last_occurrence != -1`), it checks if they are the same. If they are, it removes the first occurrence only using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`.
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, it constructs a new string without the first and last occurrences of the character by slicing the string appropriately.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **No Occurrences**: If the character does not appear in the string, the function simply returns the original string.
   - **Single Occurrence**: If the character appears exactly once, the function removes that single occurrence.
   - **Multiple Occurrences**: If the character appears multiple times, the function removes both the first and the last occurrences.

Given the output hints and the problem description, the function handles all the mentioned cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
