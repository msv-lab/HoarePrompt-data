Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly handles all the specified cases as outlined in the problem description:

1. When the character `char` is not found in the string `s`, the function returns the original string `s`. This is correctly handled by the `else` block.
2. When the character `char` appears only once in the string `s`, the function correctly removes the single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. This is correctly handled by the `if` block.
3. When the character `char` appears multiple times in the string `s`, the function correctly removes both the first and the last occurrences by constructing a new string that excludes these characters. This is correctly handled by the nested `else` block.

The annotations in the annotated version of the code also align with these behaviors and confirm that the function operates as intended. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate and should be maintained.
