Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`. Both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not equal to -1, indicating that `char` is found in `s` and the first occurrence is different from the last occurrence.**
