The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a single character string. 

- If `char` appears at least once in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed.
- If `char` appears at least twice in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with the character `char` removed from both its first and last occurrence.
- If `char` does not appear in `s` at all, the function returns the original string `s`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `char`, and return the string `s` modified according to the first occurrence of `char` or both the first and last occurrences of `char`, or return the original string `s` if `char` does not appear in `s`.
