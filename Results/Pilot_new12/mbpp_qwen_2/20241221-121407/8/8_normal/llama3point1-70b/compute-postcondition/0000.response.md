The `find` method returns the lowest index of the substring (if found in the given string). In this case, `s.find(char)` will search for the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` and return its index. If the character is not found, it returns `-1`. 

Given the initial state where `s` is a string and `char` is a single character string, after executing `first_occurrence = s.find(char)`, `first_occurrence` will be assigned the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found in `s`.**
