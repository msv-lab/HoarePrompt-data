`last_occurrence` is assigned the value of the last occurrence of `char` in `s` using the `rfind` method. The `rfind` method returns the highest index of the substring (if found). If `char` is not found in `s`, it returns `-1`. The states of the other variables (`s` and `char`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found in `s`; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found in `s`; `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, or -1 if `char` is not found in `s`**
