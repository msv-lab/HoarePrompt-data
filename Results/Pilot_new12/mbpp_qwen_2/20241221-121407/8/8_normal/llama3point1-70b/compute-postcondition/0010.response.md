Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a single character string. It returns the string `s` modified based on the occurrences of `char` within `s`.

- If `char` appears exactly once in `s`, the function returns `s` with the first (and only) occurrence of `char` removed.
- If `char` appears more than once in `s`, the function returns `s` with the first and last occurrences of `char` removed.
- If `char` does not appear in `s` at all, the function returns the original string `s`.

Thus, the function modifies the string `s` according to the specified conditions, ensuring that the first and/or last occurrence of `char` is removed where applicable, or returns the original string if no such occurrences exist.**

This summary covers all potential cases based on the code provided and ensures that the actual behavior of the function is accurately described.
