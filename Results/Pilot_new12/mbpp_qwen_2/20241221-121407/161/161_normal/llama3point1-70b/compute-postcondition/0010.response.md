The code `a, b = b, a + b` updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3. After executing the code:

- `b` is reassigned to its original value, which is 3.
- `a` is reassigned to the value of `a + b`, which is `1 + 3 = 4`.

The variable `n` remains unchanged since it was not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 3**
