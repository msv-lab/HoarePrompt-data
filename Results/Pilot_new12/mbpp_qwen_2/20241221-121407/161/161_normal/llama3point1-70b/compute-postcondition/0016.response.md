Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns either 2, 1, or the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from the first Fibonacci number (1). Specifically, if `n` is 0, the function returns 2. If `n` is 1, the function returns 1. For any other non-negative integer `n`, the function computes the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number using an iterative approach and returns it.**

This summary covers all the potential cases mentioned in the annotations and the code itself, ensuring that the state of the program after execution is accurately described.
