`a` and `b` are reassigned such that `a` gets the current value of `b`, and `b` gets the sum of the current values of `a` and `b`. Given the initial values `a` is 2 and `b` is 1, after the reassignment, `a` becomes 1 and `b` becomes 2 + 1 = 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is at least 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
