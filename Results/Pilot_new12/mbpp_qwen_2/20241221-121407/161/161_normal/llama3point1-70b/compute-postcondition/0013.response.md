Let's analyze the given loop step by step:

### Initial State
- `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1.
- `a` is 2.
- `b` is 1.

### Loop Code
```python
for _ in range(2, n + 1):
    a, b = b, a + b
```

### Observations from Provided Output States
- After 1 iteration (when `n` is at least 2):
  - `a` becomes `1`.
  - `b` becomes `3`.
- After 2 iterations (when `n` is at least 4):
  - `a` becomes `4`.
  - `b` becomes `3`.
- After 3 iterations (when `n` is at least 5):
  - `a` becomes `7`.
  - `b` becomes `4`.

### Analysis
From the provided states, we observe that the values of `a` and `b` are changing based on the Fibonacci sequence, starting from the initial values of `a = 2` and `b = 1`.

- In the first iteration, `a` changes from `2` to `1` and `b` changes from `1` to `3`.
- In subsequent iterations, the new value of `a` is the previous `b`, and the new value of `b` is the sum of the previous `a` and `b`.

### General Pattern
- For each iteration \( k \) (where \( k \geq 1 \)):
  - `a` becomes the value of `b` from the previous iteration.
  - `b` becomes the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`.

### Conclusion
After all iterations of the loop have finished, the final values of `a` and `b` will be determined by the Fibonacci sequence starting from the initial values `a = 2` and `b = 1`. Specifically, after \( n-1 \) iterations (since the loop starts from 2), the value of `a` will be the \( (n-1) \)-th Fibonacci number starting from the second Fibonacci number (which is 1), and the value of `b` will be the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from the first Fibonacci number (which is 1).

### Final Output State
- If the loop executes \( n-1 \) times (which means \( n \geq 2 \)):
  - `a` is the \( (n-1) \)-th Fibonacci number starting from the second Fibonacci number (1).
  - `b` is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from the first Fibonacci number (1).

### Output State
**Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `a` is the \( (n-1) \)-th Fibonacci number starting from the second Fibonacci number (1), `b` is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from the first Fibonacci number (1).**
