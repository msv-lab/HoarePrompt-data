According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs from 2 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `a` is 4, and `b` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 5 because the loop starts at 2 and goes up to `n-1`.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `n` must be at least 5, while `a` remains 4, and `b` remains 3.

State: **`n` is at least 5, `a` is 4, `b` is 3**
