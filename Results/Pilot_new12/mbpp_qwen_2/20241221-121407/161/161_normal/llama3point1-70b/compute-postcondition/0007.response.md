According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `n` is greater than or equal to 2. The initial states given are:

- `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0, and `n` is not equal to 1.
- `a` is 2.
- `b` is 1.

For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. Since the problem explicitly states that `n` is not equal to 1, we can confirm that if `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0 or 1, then the only possible values left for `n` to satisfy the loop condition are those greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be at least 2.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
