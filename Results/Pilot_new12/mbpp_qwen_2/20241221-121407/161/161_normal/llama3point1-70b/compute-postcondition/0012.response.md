The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, and updates `a` to the sum of its original value and `b`. Initially, `a` is 4 and `b` is 3.

- The new value of `a` will be `b` (which is 3) plus `a` (which is 4), so `a` becomes 7.
- The value of `b` will now be the original value of `a`, which is 4.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `a` is 7, `b` is 4**
