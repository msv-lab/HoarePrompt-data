Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the Lucas sequence. The base cases are handled for `n = 0` and `n = 1` as specified. For other values of `n`, the code iteratively calculates the n-th Lucas number, which is defined as the n-th Fibonacci number plus 1 (i.e., L(n) = F(n+1), where F(n) is the n-th Fibonacci number). The iterative loop correctly updates the values of `a` and `b` to compute the Lucas number. Given the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to work correctly for all potential cases of non-negative integers.
