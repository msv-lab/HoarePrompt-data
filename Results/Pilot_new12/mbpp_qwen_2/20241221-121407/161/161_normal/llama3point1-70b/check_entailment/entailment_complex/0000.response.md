Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks to write a function to find the n'th Lucas number, but the provided program actually computes the n'th Fibonacci number instead. The Lucas numbers are defined by the recurrence relation L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) with initial values L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, whereas the Fibonacci numbers are defined by F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) with initial values F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1. 

In the provided code, the base cases match those of the Lucas sequence, but the recursive computation inside the for loop incorrectly calculates the Fibonacci sequence. Therefore, the program does not compute the n'th Lucas number as required by the problem description.
