Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is intended to find the \( n \)-th Lucas number, but it actually finds the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number. The Lucas numbers are defined as a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different initial values: \( L(0) = 2 \), \( L(1) = 1 \). The \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starts with \( F(0) = 0 \), \( F(1) = 1 \).

In the given code:
- For \( n = 0 \), it returns 2, which is correct for the Lucas sequence.
- For \( n = 1 \), it returns 1, which is also correct for the Lucas sequence.
- For \( n > 1 \), it calculates the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number instead of the \( n \)-th Lucas number.

To correctly implement the \( n \)-th Lucas number, the logic should be adjusted to match the initial conditions of the Lucas sequence. Specifically, for \( n > 1 \), the code should use the initial values \( a = 2 \) and \( b = 1 \) and compute the next terms accordingly. However, the current implementation uses the initial values for the Fibonacci sequence, leading to incorrect results for all \( n > 1 \).

Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
    elif (n == 1) :
        return 1
    else :
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
            
        return b
```

This version correctly implements the Lucas sequence, ensuring that the program meets the problem description.
