Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two numbers. The function handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1` correctly and uses a loop to compute the n'th Lucas number for any positive integer `n`. Since the function works for the base cases and the general case, and there are no obvious edge cases that the function does not handle, the program is correct.
