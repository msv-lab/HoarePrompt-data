Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the n'th Lucas number. However, based on the output hints, the function actually returns the n-th Fibonacci number instead of the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, whereas the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1. The function `func_1` matches the Fibonacci sequence rather than the Lucas sequence, which means it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is incorrect.
