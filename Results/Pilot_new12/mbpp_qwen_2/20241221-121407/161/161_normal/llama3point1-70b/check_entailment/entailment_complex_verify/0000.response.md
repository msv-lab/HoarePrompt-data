Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the Lucas sequence as described. The annotated version confirms that:
- For \( n = 0 \), the function returns 2.
- For \( n = 1 \), the function returns 1.
- For \( n > 1 \), the function correctly uses an iterative approach to compute the \( n \)-th Lucas number, which is defined as \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \).

The annotations align with the problem description and the original assessment, indicating that the program is indeed correct in generating the Lucas sequence as required. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of the program's correctness is appropriate.
