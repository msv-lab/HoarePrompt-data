Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the Lucas sequence. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- \( L(0) = 2 \)
- \( L(1) = 1 \)
- For \( n > 1 \), \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \)

The given program correctly handles these definitions:
- It returns 2 for \( n = 0 \).
- It returns 1 for \( n = 1 \).
- For \( n > 1 \), it iterates from 2 to \( n \) and correctly computes the Lucas number using the recurrence relation.

Since the program correctly implements the Lucas sequence for all tested cases and no edge cases or inputs were found where the program fails to meet the requirements, the program is correct.
