Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment incorrectly identifies the function as correctly implementing the Lucas sequence. According to the annotations and the problem description, the function should return the n-th Lucas number, which starts with 2 and 1. However, the implementation provided is actually generating Fibonacci numbers, which start with 0 and 1. The function initializes `a` and `b` to 2 and 1 respectively, and then iterates to compute the next Fibonacci-like sequence, not the Lucas sequence. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description.
