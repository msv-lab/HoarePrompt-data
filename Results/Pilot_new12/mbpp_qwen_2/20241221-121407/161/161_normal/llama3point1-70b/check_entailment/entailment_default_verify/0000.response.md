Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment incorrectly states that the program correctly implements the Lucas sequence. According to the problem description, the function should return the n-th Lucas number. However, the provided code actually computes the n-th Fibonacci number. The output hints further confirm this, stating that for any other non-negative integer `n`, the function computes the n-th Fibonacci number using an iterative approach and returns it. The Lucas sequence and the Fibonacci sequence have different initial values and recurrence relations:
- Lucas sequence: \( L(0) = 2 \), \( L(1) = 1 \)
- Fibonacci sequence: \( F(0) = 0 \), \( F(1) = 1 \)

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and should return the n-th Lucas number instead of the n-th Fibonacci number. Thus, the original assessment is not accurate, and the final assessment is **False**.
