Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the \( n \)-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is defined such that \( L(0) = 2 \), \( L(1) = 1 \), and for \( n > 1 \), \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \). The given code accurately follows this definition:

- If \( n = 0 \), it returns 2.
- If \( n = 1 \), it returns 1.
- For any other \( n \), it iteratively calculates the \( n \)-th Lucas number using an iterative approach similar to computing Fibonacci numbers but with initial values of 2 and 1.

The output hints confirm that the function returns the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number starting from the first Fibonacci number (1), which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
