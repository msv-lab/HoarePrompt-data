Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets the requirements of finding the n-th Lucas number. The annotated version confirms that the program initializes `a` and `b` to the first two values of the Lucas sequence (2 and 1), respectively. The for loop then correctly computes subsequent Lucas numbers by updating `a` and `b` according to the recurrence relation \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \). The final return statement correctly returns the n-th Lucas number.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, there is no evidence to suggest that the program is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
