Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the provided code and the original assessment correctly identify that the function `func_1` computes the n-th Lucas number, there is a misunderstanding in the annotations regarding the nature of the sequence being computed. The function is actually computing the n-th Fibonacci number, not the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, whereas the Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1 or 1 and 1. The provided code matches the logic for the Fibonacci sequence, not the Lucas sequence. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the final assessment should be **False**.
