Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the Lucas sequence for the first few test cases (`func_1(9)`, `func_1(4)`, `func_1(3)`). However, it does not handle the general case for finding the n'th Lucas number correctly. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- \( L_0 = 2 \)
- \( L_1 = 1 \)
- \( L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2} \) for \( n > 1 \)

The provided function seems to be implementing the Fibonacci sequence instead of the Lucas sequence. Specifically, the initial values are swapped (`2, 1` instead of `2, 1`), which means the sequence generated will not match the Lucas sequence.

For example, the 5th Lucas number should be 11, but the function returns 8:
```python
assert func_1(5) == 11  # Expected, but the function returns 8
```

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
