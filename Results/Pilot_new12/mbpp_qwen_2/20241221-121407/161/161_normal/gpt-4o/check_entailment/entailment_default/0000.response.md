Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not correctly implement the Lucas sequence. According to the problem description, the function should find the \( n \)-th Lucas number. However, the implementation provided computes the \((n+1)\)-th Fibonacci number instead. For example, the first few Lucas numbers are 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, ... whereas the first few Fibonacci numbers are 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ... As shown in the test cases, the function returns the correct values for \( n = 0 \), \( n = 1 \), and \( n = 3 \), but it fails for \( n = 4 \) and \( n = 9 \). The correct values for these indices in the Lucas sequence are 7 and 76, respectively, not 7 and 76 as given in the test cases.

To fix this, the function should compute the \( n \)-th Lucas number directly. The initial conditions for the Lucas sequence are \( L_0 = 2 \) and \( L_1 = 1 \), and each subsequent term is the sum of the previous two terms. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

This corrected version correctly computes the \( n \)-th Lucas number for any non-negative integer \( n \).
