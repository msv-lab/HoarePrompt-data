Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function to find the n-th Lucas number. The annotated version of the code incorrectly describes the state after the for loop. Specifically, it states that `a` is the \( n \)-th Fibonacci number and `b` is the \( (n+1) \)-th Fibonacci number, which is not accurate. According to the Lucas sequence, the state after the for loop should be that `a` is the \( (n-1) \)-th Lucas number and `b` is the \( n \)-th Lucas number. The provided test cases also indicate that the function is returning incorrect values for the Lucas numbers, confirming that there is indeed an issue with the implementation. Therefore, the original assessment of the program being incorrect is accurate.
