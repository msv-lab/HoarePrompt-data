Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks for a function to find the n-th Lucas number. However, the provided function `func_1` actually computes the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number instead of the n-th Lucas number. 

To clarify, the n-th Lucas number \(L_n\) is defined as follows:
- \(L_0 = 2\)
- \(L_1 = 1\)
- \(L_n = L_{n-1} + L_{n-2}\) for \(n > 1\)

But the function `func_1` does the following:
- Returns 2 for \(n = 0\)
- Returns 1 for \(n = 1\)
- For \(n > 1\), it computes the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number, which does not match the definition of the Lucas sequence.

For instance, the first few Lucas numbers are: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, ...
However, the function returns:
- `func_1(0)` should return 2, and it does.
- `func_1(1)` should return 1, and it does.
- `func_1(2)` should return 3, but it returns 2 (the 3rd Fibonacci number).

Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the Lucas sequence and is thus incorrect according to the problem description.
