Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` is indeed implementing the Fibonacci sequence rather than the Lucas sequence. The initial values of `a` and `b` are set to 2 and 1 respectively, which are the first two Fibonacci numbers, not the first two Lucas numbers. According to the Lucas sequence definition, \(L_0 = 2\) and \(L_1 = 1\), but the function starts with \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), leading to a Fibonacci sequence where the 5th number is 8 instead of the 5th Lucas number, which is 11. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description of finding the n'th Lucas number.
