Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The annotated version of the code indicates that the function actually returns the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number, not the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1, whereas the annotated version computes the Fibonacci sequence starting with 0 and 1. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description. The original assessment is accurate in pointing out the discrepancy between the intended Lucas sequence and the computed Fibonacci sequence.
