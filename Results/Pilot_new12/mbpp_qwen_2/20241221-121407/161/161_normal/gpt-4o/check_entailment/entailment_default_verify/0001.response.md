Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` is not implementing the Lucas sequence as described. The output hints further clarify that the function is computing the \((n+1)\)-th Fibonacci number, which is not the same as the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with \(L_0 = 2\) and \(L_1 = 1\), while the function starts with \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), effectively starting with \(L_1\) and \(L_2\). This results in the sequence being shifted by one index compared to the standard Lucas sequence. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate.
