Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly implement the Lucas sequence. The problem description asks to find the n'th Lucas number, but the program is implementing the Fibonacci sequence instead. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- \( L(0) = 2 \)
- \( L(1) = 1 \)
- For \( n > 1 \), \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \)

However, the given program computes the Fibonacci sequence, which is defined as:
- \( F(0) = 0 \)
- \( F(1) = 1 \)
- For \( n > 1 \), \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \)

Here are the differences:
- The base cases for the Fibonacci sequence are \( F(0) = 0 \) and \( F(1) = 1 \), while for the Lucas sequence, they are \( L(0) = 2 \) and \( L(1) = 1 \).
- The recurrence relation for the Fibonacci sequence is \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \), while for the Lucas sequence, it is \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \).

Given the assertions:
- `func_1(9) == 76` should be `L(9) = 76`, but the program returns 55 (Fibonacci number).
- `func_1(4) == 7` should be `L(4) = 7`, but the program returns 7 (which is correct for the Fibonacci sequence, but not for the Lucas sequence).
- `func_1(3) == 4` should be `L(3) = 4`, but the program returns 3 (which is correct for the Fibonacci sequence, but not for the Lucas sequence).

Thus, the program does not meet the requirement of finding the n'th Lucas number and instead finds the n'th Fibonacci number. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
