Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The function `func_1` matches these definitions:
- It returns 2 when `n` is 0.
- It returns 1 when `n` is 1.
- For any other non-negative integer `n`, it computes the \((n+1)\)-th Fibonacci number using a loop and returns it, which is consistent with the Lucas sequence definition.

The test cases provided in the output hints also match the expected results for the Lucas sequence:
- `func_1(9)` should return 76 (L(10)).
- `func_1(4)` should return 7 (L(5)).
- `func_1(3)` should return 4 (L(4)).

Since the code matches the problem description for the given cases and the provided test cases, the correctness is **True**.
