Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` indeed computes the \((n+1)\)-th Fibonacci number, not the \(n\)-th Lucas number. The problem description asks for the \(n\)-th Lucas number, where \(L_0 = 2\) and \(L_1 = 1\). However, the function starts with the initial values \(a = 2\) and \(b = 1\), which correspond to the Fibonacci sequence starting from \(F_1 = 1\) and \(F_2 = 1\).

The annotations correctly describe the behavior of the function in terms of computing the \((n+1)\)-th Fibonacci number. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirement to compute the \(n\)-th Lucas number as specified in the problem description. The original assessment is accurate because the function is not implementing the Lucas sequence but the Fibonacci sequence.
