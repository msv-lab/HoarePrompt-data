Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies an issue with the implementation of the function `func_1`. The loop in the function updates the values of `a` and `b` incorrectly, leading to incorrect results for the Lucas numbers. Although the output hints suggest that the function computes the \((n+1)\)-th Fibonacci number, the problem description specifically asks for the \(n\)-th Lucas number, which starts with 2 and 1, not 0 and 1 as the Fibonacci sequence does. The current implementation does not correctly generate the Lucas sequence, as evidenced by the provided test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
