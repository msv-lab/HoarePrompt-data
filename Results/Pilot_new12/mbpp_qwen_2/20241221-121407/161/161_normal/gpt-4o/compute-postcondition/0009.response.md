Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer and `n` is not equal to 0 and `n` is not equal to 1, meaning `n` must be at least 2.
   - `a` is 1.
   - `b` is 3.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `2` to `n + 1`.
   - This means the loop will run `n - 1` times because it starts at `2` and ends at `n + 1`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the state just before the current iteration starts.
   - Since the loop has already run for `n - 2` iterations (as it started from `2` and we are currently at the `(n-1)`th iteration), `n` must now be reduced by `1`.

4. **Updated States:**
   - `n` is now `n - 1`.
   - `a` remains unchanged at `1`.
   - `b` remains unchanged at `3`.

5. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be at least `2` after decrementing by `1`.
   - If `n` was originally `2`, it would become `1`, but since `n` cannot be `1`, it must have been at least `3` originally to allow the loop to run for `n - 1` times.

Given this analysis, let's formulate the updated state:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and `n` is not equal to 0 and `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` must be at least 3; `a` is 1; `b` is 3**
