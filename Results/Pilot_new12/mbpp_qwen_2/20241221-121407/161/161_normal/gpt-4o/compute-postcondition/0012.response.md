The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` and updates `a` to be the sum of the original `b` and `a`. Given the initial values `a` is 3 and `b` is 4, after the assignment `a` will be 7 (since `a + b` is 3 + 4) and `b` will be 4. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0 or 1, and `n` must be at least 4; `a` is 7; `b` is 4**
