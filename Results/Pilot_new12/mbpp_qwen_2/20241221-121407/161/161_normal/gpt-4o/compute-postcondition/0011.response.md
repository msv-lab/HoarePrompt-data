Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0 or 1, and `n` must be at least 3.
   - `a` is 3.
   - `b` is 4.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `n` inclusive. This means the loop will run `n - 1` times since it starts at `2`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Since the loop runs from `2` to `n`, the loop has already run for all values from `2` up to some value less than `n`.
   - Therefore, if the loop has completed one full iteration (i.e., for `i = 2`), then `n` must be greater than 2.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the loop variable `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Since the loop has already executed for `i = 2`, the next value of `i` would be `3` if the loop were to continue.
   - Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be 3, and `n` must be greater than 3.

5. **Updating States**:
   - `a` remains unchanged as `3`.
   - `b` remains unchanged as `4`.
   - `n` must now be greater than 3 (since the loop will run until `i` reaches `n`).

So, the updated states for the start of the next iteration are:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0 or 1, and `n` must be at least 4; `a` is 3; `b` is 4**
