The code updates the values of `a` and `b` using tuple unpacking. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. The new value of `a` becomes the current value of `b`, which is 1, and the new value of `b` becomes the sum of the original values of `a` and `b`, which is 2 + 1 = 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and `n` is not equal to 0 and `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` must be at least 2; `a` is 1; `b` is 3**
