`a` and `b` are swapped, and `b` is also updated to the value of `a + b`. Given the initial state where `a` is 1 and `b` is 3, after the operation, `a` will become 3 and `b` will become `1 + 3`, which is 4. The value of `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and `n` is not equal to 0 and `n` is not equal to 1, and `n` must be at least 3; `a` is 3; `b` is 4**
