The code creates a new list `nth_column` by extracting the nth element from each sublist (row) in the matrix. The value of `n` is used to determine which column to extract, but the actual elements of `matrix` and the value of `n` itself are not changed.

After executing the code, the `matrix` remains unchanged, and the `nth_column` variable is assigned a new list containing the nth elements from each row of the `matrix`.

Output State: **matrix is a 2D list of integers, and n is an integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]); nth_column is a list containing the nth element from each row of matrix.**
