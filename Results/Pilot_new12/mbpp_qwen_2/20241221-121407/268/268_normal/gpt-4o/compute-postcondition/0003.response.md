Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and an integer `n`, where `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`. It extracts the nth column from the matrix by collecting the nth element from each row into a new list called `nth_column`. Then, it finds and returns the maximum value from this `nth_column` list. Potential edge cases include when `matrix` is empty or when `n` is at either boundary of the valid range (i.e., `0` or `len(matrix[0])-1`). If `matrix` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access elements. If `n` is out of the valid range, the function will also raise an `IndexError`.**
