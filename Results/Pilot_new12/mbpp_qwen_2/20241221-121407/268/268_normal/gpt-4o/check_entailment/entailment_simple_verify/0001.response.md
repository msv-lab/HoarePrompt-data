Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of finding the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The annotations provided further confirm that the function behaves as expected. Specifically:

1. Before the function call, the state of the program ensures that `matrix` is a 2D list of integers, and `n` is an integer within the valid range (0 <= n < len(matrix[0])).

2. Inside the function, the list comprehension `[row[n] for row in matrix]` correctly extracts the n'th element from each row of the matrix, forming the n'th column.

3. The `max()` function then correctly determines the maximum value in this extracted list.

The provided assertions cover various scenarios and validate the function's correctness. Since there are no issues or inconsistencies noted in the annotated version, the original assessment remains valid.
