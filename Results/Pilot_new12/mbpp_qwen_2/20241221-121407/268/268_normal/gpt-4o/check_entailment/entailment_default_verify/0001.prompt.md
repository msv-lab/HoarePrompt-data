You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11

def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of finding the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The function iterates over each row in the matrix, extracts the element at the specified column index, and then finds the maximum value among those elements. 

The assertions provided cover different scenarios:
1. The first assertion checks the third column (`n=2`) of a matrix with varying values, and correctly identifies the maximum value as `19`.
2. The second assertion checks the second column (`n=1`) and also correctly identifies the maximum value as `10`.
3. The third assertion checks the second column again (`n=1`) with a different set of values and correctly identifies the maximum value as `11`.

Since the function handles the provided test cases correctly and the logic appears sound for extracting and comparing column values, the function is correct for the given problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or errors in the provided code that would cause it to fail for other potential inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and an integer `n`, where `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`. It extracts the nth column from the matrix by collecting the nth element from each row into a new list called `nth_column`. Then, it finds and returns the maximum value from this `nth_column` list. Potential edge cases include when `matrix` is empty or when `n` is at either boundary of the valid range (i.e., `0` or `len(matrix[0])-1`). If `matrix` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access elements. If `n` is out of the valid range, the function will also raise an `IndexError`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
