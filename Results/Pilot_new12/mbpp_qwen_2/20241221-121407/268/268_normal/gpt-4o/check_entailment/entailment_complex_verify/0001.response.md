Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of finding the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The annotations accurately describe the behavior and constraints of the function. Specifically, the function extracts the nth column from the matrix and returns the maximum value from that column. The provided assertions cover different scenarios and validate the function's correctness. Since there are no issues identified in the function's logic or handling of edge cases under the assumption of valid input, the original assessment is accurate.
