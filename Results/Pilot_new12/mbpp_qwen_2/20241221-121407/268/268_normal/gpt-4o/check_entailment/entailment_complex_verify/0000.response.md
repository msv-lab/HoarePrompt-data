Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum value in the specified column of a matrix. The provided assertions cover various scenarios and demonstrate the function's correctness. The annotated version clarifies that the function correctly extracts the `n`-th column from the matrix and returns the maximum value from this column. There are no issues or edge cases mentioned in the annotated version that would render the function incorrect under the given problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** remains valid.
