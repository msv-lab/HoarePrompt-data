You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11

#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of integers, and n is an integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]).
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the nth_column list, which contains the nth element from each row of the matrix
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and an integer `n`, where `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`. It extracts the nth column from the matrix by collecting the nth element from each row into a new list called `nth_column`. Then, it finds and returns the maximum value from this `nth_column` list. Potential edge cases include when `matrix` is empty or when `n` is at either boundary of the valid range (i.e., `0` or `len(matrix[0])-1`). If `matrix` is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access elements. If `n` is out of the valid range, the function will also raise an `IndexError`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
