Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that, given a matrix (represented as a list of lists) and an integer `n`, returns the maximum value from the `n`-th column of the matrix.

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `matrix` (a 2D list) and `n` (an integer).
   - It extracts the `n`-th column from the matrix using a list comprehension: `[row[n] for row in matrix]`.
   - It then returns the maximum value from this extracted column using the `max()` function.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions test different scenarios:
     - `func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2)` should return `19` because the third column values are `[7, 5, 19]`, and the maximum is `19`.
     - `func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1)` should return `10` because the second column values are `[7, 4, 10]`, and the maximum is `10`.
     - `func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1)` should return `11` because the second column values are `[8, 5, 11]`, and the maximum is `11`.

Since the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and passes all the provided test cases, the program is correct.
