Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Given a matrix represented as a list of lists, the function `func_1` returns the maximum value from the specified column `n`. The code handles the extraction of the nth column and finding the maximum value within it. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and validate the function's correctness. The output hints confirm that the code works as intended for the given examples and potential edge cases such as when the matrix is empty or `n` is at the boundary. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
