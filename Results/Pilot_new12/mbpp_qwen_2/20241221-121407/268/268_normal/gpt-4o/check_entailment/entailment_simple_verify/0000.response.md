Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear description of the state of the program at different points, and it aligns with the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly extracts the `n`-th column from the matrix and returns the maximum value from that column. The provided test cases in the assertions demonstrate that the function works as intended for various inputs. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
