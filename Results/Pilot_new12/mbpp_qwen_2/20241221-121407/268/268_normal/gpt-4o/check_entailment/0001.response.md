Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of finding the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. The function iterates over each row in the matrix, extracts the element at the specified column index, and then finds the maximum value among those elements. 

The assertions provided cover different scenarios:
1. The first assertion checks the third column (`n=2`) of a matrix with varying values, and correctly identifies the maximum value as `19`.
2. The second assertion checks the second column (`n=1`) and also correctly identifies the maximum value as `10`.
3. The third assertion checks the second column again (`n=1`) with a different set of values and correctly identifies the maximum value as `11`.

Since the function handles the provided test cases correctly and the logic appears sound for extracting and comparing column values, the function is correct for the given problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or errors in the provided code that would cause it to fail for other potential inputs.
