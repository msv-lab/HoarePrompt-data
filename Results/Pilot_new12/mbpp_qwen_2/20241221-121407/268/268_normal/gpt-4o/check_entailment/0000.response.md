Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the specified column of the matrix. The function iterates through each row of the matrix, extracts the element in the `n`-th column, and then returns the maximum value from these elements. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and demonstrate that the function works as expected. Since the function handles the given problem description correctly for all tested cases and no edge cases were found that would cause the function to fail, the program is considered correct.
