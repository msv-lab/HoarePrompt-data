Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should return the maximum value of the \(n\)-th column, not the \((n-1)\)-th element of each row. The function accesses `row[n - 1]` instead of `row[n]`. This means that when \(n = 0\), it tries to access the last element of each row (which is `row[-1]`), and when \(n = 1\), it accesses the second-to-last element of each row, and so on. To meet the problem description, the function should be:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```

This change ensures that the function correctly finds the maximum value in the \(n\)-th column of the matrix.
