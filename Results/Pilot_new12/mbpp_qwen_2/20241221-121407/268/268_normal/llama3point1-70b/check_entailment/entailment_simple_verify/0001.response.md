Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly returns the maximum value of the n'th column of the matrix. The annotated version further clarifies that the input matrix is a 2D list of integers and `n` is a non-negative integer within the valid range of column indices. The code generates the (n-1)-th element from each row (considering 0-based indexing) and uses `max()` to find the maximum value among these elements. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description and the annotations provided. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
