Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided function `func_1` generally works correctly for finding the maximum value in the specified column of the matrix, the annotated version highlights an important edge case that was not initially considered in the original assessment. Specifically, when `n` is 0, the function attempts to access `row[-1]`, which is outside the valid range for the indices of the rows. This will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, the function should handle this edge case by ensuring `n > 0` or providing a default value when `n` is 0. Since the original assessment did not account for this potential error, the corrected assessment is that the program is not fully correct according to the problem description.
