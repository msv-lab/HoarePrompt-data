Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly assumes that the function `func_1` handles the edge case where `n` is 0, which would result in an `IndexError` because it tries to access `row[-1]` for the first row. According to the annotated version, the function should ensure that `n > 0` or provide a default value when `n` is 0 to avoid accessing an invalid index. Since the current implementation does not handle this edge case, the function can fail when `n` is 0. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem description.
