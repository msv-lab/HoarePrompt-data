Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the maximum value from the n'th column of the matrix. The expression `(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)` generates the n'th element from each row (considering 0-based indexing), and `max()` finds the maximum value among these elements. This logic handles all potential cases where `n` is within the range of the number of columns in the matrix. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
