Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment assumes that the function `func_1` correctly handles the problem description without considering edge cases. However, the output hints reveal that the function attempts to access the \((n-1)\)-th element of each row, which can lead to an `IndexError` if \(n = 0\). Since the problem description asks for the n'th column and the provided implementation does not handle the case where \(n\) is 0, the function is not fully correct according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the final assessment is **False**.
