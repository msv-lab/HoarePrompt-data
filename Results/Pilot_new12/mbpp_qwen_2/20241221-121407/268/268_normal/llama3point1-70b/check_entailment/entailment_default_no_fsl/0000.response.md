Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case when `n` is 0. When `n` is 0, the code attempts to access `row[n - 1]` which is equivalent to accessing `row[-1]`, leading to an `IndexError`. Although the output hints suggest handling this edge case, the current implementation does not include any such check. Therefore, the program is incorrect for the case when `n` is 0.
