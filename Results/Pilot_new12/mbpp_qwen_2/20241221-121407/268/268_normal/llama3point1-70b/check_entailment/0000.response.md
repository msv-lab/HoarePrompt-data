Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the specified column of the matrix. Given the problem description, the function should return the maximum value of the n'th column. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the n'th element of each row and applies the `max` function to find the maximum value. This approach handles all elements in the column correctly and works for any valid column index within the matrix dimensions. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
