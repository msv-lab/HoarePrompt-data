Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should return the maximum value of the n'th column, not the (n-1)-th element. 

Here's why it is incorrect:

- The problem description specifies that the function should return the maximum value of the n'th column.
- The program instead accesses the (n-1)-th element of each row using `row[n - 1]`. This means it is looking at the values in the column immediately before the n'th column, not the n'th column itself.

To fix this, the program should use `row[n]` instead of `row[n - 1]` to correctly access the n'th element of each row and then find the maximum value of these elements. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
```

This corrected version will now correctly return the maximum value of the n'th column as required by the problem description.
