Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum value in the n'th column of a matrix. The annotated version clarifies that `matrix` is a 2D list of integers and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`. This ensures that the column index is valid and within the bounds of the matrix.

The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the n'th element of each row (`row[n - 1]`) and applies the `max` function to find the maximum value. Since the annotated version confirms that the input is valid, the function will correctly compute the maximum value of the specified column. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program meets the problem description.
