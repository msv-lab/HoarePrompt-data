Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the original assessment correctly notes that the function `func_1` finds the maximum value in the specified column, it fails to address the potential `IndexError` that can occur when `n` is 0. The output hints indicate that accessing the \((n-1)\)-th element of each row can lead to an `IndexError` if \(n\) is 0, as it attempts to access the \(-1\)-th index. Therefore, the function should handle this edge case either by ensuring \(n > 0\) or by providing a default value when \(n\) is 0. Since the original assessment does not account for this issue, the program's correctness cannot be fully guaranteed without addressing this edge case.
