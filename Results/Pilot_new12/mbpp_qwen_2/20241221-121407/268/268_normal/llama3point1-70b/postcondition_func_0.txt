The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum value among the \((n-1)\)-th element of each row in the matrix. The function iterates over each row in the matrix, accesses the \((n-1)\)-th element of each row, and computes the maximum value among these elements. If `n` is 0, the function will attempt to access `-1` index of the first row, which will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, the function should handle this edge case by ensuring `n > 0` or providing a default value when `n` is 0.
