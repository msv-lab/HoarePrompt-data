The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `matrix`, which is a 2D list of integers, and `n`, which is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n < \text{len(matrix[0])}\). The function returns the maximum value among the \((n-1)\)-th element of each row in the matrix.

Functionality: **The function accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum value among the \((n-1)\)-th element of each row in the matrix.**
