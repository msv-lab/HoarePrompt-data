Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a list is sorted in ascending order for lists with more than one element, the original assessment overlooks the fact that the function does not handle the edge cases where the list is empty or contains a single element. According to the output hints, the function should explicitly return `True` in these scenarios. However, the current implementation does not account for these cases, which means it would incorrectly return `False` for both an empty list and a list with a single element. Therefore, the original assessment cannot be maintained, and the program is considered incorrect based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
