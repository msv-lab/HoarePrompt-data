Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the cases where the list is empty or contains a single element. According to the problem description, the function should check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The output hints indicate that the current implementation does not return `True` for empty lists or lists with a single element, which means it fails to handle these edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is not fully correct as it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
