Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in ascending order for most cases, it does not handle edge cases where the list is empty or contains a single element. According to the output hints, the function should explicitly return `True` in these scenarios. The original assessment does not account for these edge cases, which are important for the function to be considered fully correct. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the original assessment needs to be revised to reflect this missing handling of edge cases.
