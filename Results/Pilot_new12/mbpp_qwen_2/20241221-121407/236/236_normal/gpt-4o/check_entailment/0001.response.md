Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted in ascending order by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, if no such pair is found, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover several scenarios:
1. A fully sorted list: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` - This returns `True`.
2. A list that is not sorted due to a later out-of-order element: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` - This returns `False` correctly.
3. A list that is not sorted due to an earlier out-of-order element: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` - This returns `False` correctly.

These test cases demonstrate that the function works correctly for the provided examples. Since the function logic is straightforward and the provided test cases cover various potential cases, we can conclude that the function is correct for every potential case within the scope of these examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
