Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function that checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. The provided function `func_1` iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If any element is found to be greater than the next element, the function returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted.

The annotated version provides insights into the state of the program at different points and confirms that the function behaves as expected:
- The `for` loop checks each consecutive pair of elements.
- If any pair violates the sorting condition (i.e., `lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), the function returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases validate the function's behavior:
1. A fully sorted list: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` - Returns `True`.
2. A list that is not sorted due to a later out-of-order element: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` - Returns `False` correctly.
3. A list that is not sorted due to an earlier out-of-order element: `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` - Returns `False` correctly.

While the function does not explicitly handle the case where the list is empty or contains a single element, the problem description did not specify that such cases should be handled separately. Since the function returns `True` for both empty and single-element lists (as implied by the loop logic), the function meets the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the final assessment remains **True**.
