Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem requires writing a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The function `func_1` iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. If it completes the iteration without finding such a pair, it returns `True`, indicating the list is sorted.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Iterative Check**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the list from the first element to the second-to-last element.
2. **Comparison Logic**: Inside the loop, it compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than its successor, it returns `False` immediately.
3. **Completion Check**: If the loop completes without finding any out-of-order elements, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases also confirm the behavior:
- `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` is sorted, so the function returns `True`.
- `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` is not sorted (due to `14 < 20 > 17`), so the function returns `False`.
- `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` is not sorted (due to `15 > 14`), so the function returns `False`.

Since the function behaves as expected for all the test cases and matches the problem description, the program is correct.
