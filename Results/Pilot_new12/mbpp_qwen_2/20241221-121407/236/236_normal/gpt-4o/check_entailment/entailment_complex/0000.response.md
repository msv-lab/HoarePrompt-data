Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Here's why:

1. **Function Logic**: The function iterates through the list using a `for` loop and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted. If no such pair is found during the iteration, the function implicitly returns `True` (since it reaches the end of the loop without finding any out-of-order elements).

2. **Edge Cases Handling**: Although the comments suggest that handling the case where the list is empty or contains a single element would make the function more robust, the current implementation still correctly identifies such lists as sorted. An empty list or a list with a single element is inherently in non-decreasing order.

3. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases validate the function for both correctly sorted and unsorted lists:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17])` returns `True` (correctly sorted).
   - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17])` returns `False` (not correctly sorted).
   - `func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20])` returns `False` (not correctly sorted).

Given that the function logic aligns with the problem description and the provided test cases confirm its correctness, the program is correct.
