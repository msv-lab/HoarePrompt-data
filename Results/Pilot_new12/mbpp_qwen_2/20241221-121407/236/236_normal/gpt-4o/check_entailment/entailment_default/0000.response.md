Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided checks if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. While the provided test cases seem to cover typical scenarios, the function does not handle the edge cases where the list is empty or contains a single element. According to the problem description, the function should correctly identify whether a specified list is sorted. The output hints indicate that the function should return `True` for empty or single-element lists, but the current implementation does not cover these cases. Therefore, the function is not correct for every potential case.
