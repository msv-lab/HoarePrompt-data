Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in ascending order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one, returning `False` as soon as it finds an element that is greater than the next one. If no such pair is found, it returns `True`. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- A fully sorted list (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`) returns `True`.
- A list with a disorderly element (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`) returns `False`.
- A list with a descending sequence among sorted elements (`[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`) returns `False`.

Since the function works correctly for these cases and follows the problem description accurately, it is correct.
