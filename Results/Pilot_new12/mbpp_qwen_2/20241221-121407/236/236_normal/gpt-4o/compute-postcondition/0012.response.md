The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of comparable elements. The function has multiple return points, but in all cases, it returns `False` except for one case where it returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and return `True` under specific conditions, while returning `False` in other cases.
