Output State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements, and the function returns `False` if any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`. If no such pair is found, the function does not return and continues execution until the end of the loop, implying that the list is in non-decreasing order.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through the list `lst` from the start to the second last element.
- For each iteration, it checks if the current element (`lst[i]`) is greater than the next element (`lst[i + 1]`).
- If such a pair is found where `lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`, the function immediately returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function does not return within the loop and continues execution until the end, indicating that the list is in non-decreasing order.

Since the loop checks every adjacent pair in the list, if no violations of the condition are found, the list remains in a non-decreasing order, and the function will not return `False`.
