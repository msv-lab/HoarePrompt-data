Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements. It iterates through the list to check if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If it finds any element that is greater than the next element, it returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any such pair, it returns `True`. The function does not modify the list `lst` and only returns a boolean value based on the order of elements in the list.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list is empty, the function should return `True` because an empty list is considered to be in non-decreasing order.
- If the list contains a single element, the function should also return `True` because a single element is trivially in non-decreasing order.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The current implementation does not handle the case where the list is empty or contains a single element. To fully cover these edge cases, the function should explicitly return `True` in these scenarios. 

**Summary of Final State:**
After the function concludes, the program state will be such that the function has either returned `True`, indicating that the list is in non-decreasing order (including cases with an empty list or a single element), or it has returned `False`, indicating that the list is not in non-decreasing order.
