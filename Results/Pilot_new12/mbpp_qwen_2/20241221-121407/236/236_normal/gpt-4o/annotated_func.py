#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of comparable elements, and the function returns `False` if any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`. If no such pair is found, the function does not return and continues execution until the end of the loop, implying that the list is in non-decreasing order.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:- The current implementation does not handle the case where the list is empty or contains a single element. To fully cover these edge cases, the function should explicitly return `True` in these scenarios.
