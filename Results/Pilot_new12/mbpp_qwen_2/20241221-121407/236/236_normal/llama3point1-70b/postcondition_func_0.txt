The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and checks whether the list is sorted in ascending order. It returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input list and only uses a simple comparison between the original list and its sorted version. An edge case to consider is when the input list is empty, in which case the function also returns `True` since an empty list is considered sorted. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
