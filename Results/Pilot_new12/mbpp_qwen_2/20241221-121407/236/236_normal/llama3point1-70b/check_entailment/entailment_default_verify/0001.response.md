Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the input list `nums` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version. The provided output hints confirm that the function returns `True` for an empty list, which is considered sorted. The function also handles both ascending and descending sorted lists correctly. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided information, the program is correct.
