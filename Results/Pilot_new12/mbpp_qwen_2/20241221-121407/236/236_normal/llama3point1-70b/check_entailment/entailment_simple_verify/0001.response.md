Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the input list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. The annotation confirms that the function returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order and `False` otherwise. The function achieves this by comparing the input list to its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. This approach works for both ascending and descending sorted lists as well as unsorted lists. Therefore, the function meets the problem description and the provided annotations support its correctness.
