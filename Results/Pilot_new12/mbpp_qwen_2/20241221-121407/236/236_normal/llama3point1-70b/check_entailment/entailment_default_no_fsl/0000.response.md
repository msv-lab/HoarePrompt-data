Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(nums)` checks if the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. This approach is correct because a list is sorted if and only if it is equal to its sorted version. The function also handles the edge case where the input list is empty, returning `True` as an empty list is considered sorted. Since the function works correctly for the described problem and handles all mentioned cases, the code is correct.
