Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. The function checks whether a given list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. It does this by comparing the original list `nums` with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. If both lists are identical, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This logic correctly determines if the list is sorted in ascending order for any valid input list of comparable elements.
