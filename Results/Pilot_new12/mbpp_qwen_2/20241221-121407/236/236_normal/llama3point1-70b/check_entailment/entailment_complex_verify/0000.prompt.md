You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. This approach is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the list is already sorted in descending order. For example, the list `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` is sorted in descending order but would be incorrectly identified as unsorted by this function since sorting it again will result in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is different from the original list.

To correctly check if a list is sorted, you should compare each element with the next one to ensure they are in the correct order. Here is an example of how to do it:

```python
def is_sorted(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

This function iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element, ensuring the list is sorted in ascending order. If any element is greater than the next one, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and checks whether the list is sorted in ascending order. It returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. The function does not modify the input list and only uses a simple comparison between the original list and its sorted version. An edge case to consider is when the input list is empty, in which case the function also returns `True` since an empty list is considered sorted. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
