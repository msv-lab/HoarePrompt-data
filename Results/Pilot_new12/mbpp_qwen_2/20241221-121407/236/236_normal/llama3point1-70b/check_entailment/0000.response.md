Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. This approach is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the list is already sorted in descending order. For example, the list `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` is sorted in descending order but would be incorrectly identified as unsorted by this function since sorting it again will result in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is different from the original list.

To correctly check if a list is sorted, you should compare each element with the next one to ensure they are in the correct order. Here is an example of how to do it:

```python
def is_sorted(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True
```

This function iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element, ensuring the list is sorted in ascending order. If any element is greater than the next one, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all elements.
