Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `nums` as input and checks whether it is sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. If the original list and its sorted version are identical, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This approach is correct because two lists are identical if and only if they contain the same elements in the same order, which is the definition of being sorted. Additionally, the function handles the edge case where the input list is empty by returning `True`, as an empty list is considered sorted. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
