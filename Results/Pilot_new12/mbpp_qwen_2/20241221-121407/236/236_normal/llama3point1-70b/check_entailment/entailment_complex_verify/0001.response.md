Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. The function compares the original list to its sorted version and returns `True` if they are identical, indicating that the list is sorted. The annotation also correctly notes that an empty list is considered sorted, which is consistent with the function's behavior. There are no edge cases or issues mentioned that would make the function incorrect according to the problem description. Thus, the function meets the requirements and the original assessment is correct.
