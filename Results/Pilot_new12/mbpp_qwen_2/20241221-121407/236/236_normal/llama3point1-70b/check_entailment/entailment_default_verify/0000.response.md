Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the list is sorted in descending order. While the output hints mention that the function checks if the list is sorted in ascending order, they do not address the specific issue mentioned in the original assessment. The function compares the original list to its sorted version, which means it will return `False` for lists sorted in descending order, such as `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the function does not fully meet the problem description.
