Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` checks if a list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. However, this approach fails to account for lists that are sorted in descending order. The annotation mentions that the function returns `True` if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, which is not correct according to the problem description. The function should correctly identify both ascending and descending sorted lists, but it only checks for ascending order. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
