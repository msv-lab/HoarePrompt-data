Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the input list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version. This approach will correctly identify both ascending and descending sorted lists, as well as unsorted lists. Since the function returns `True` only when the list matches its sorted version exactly, it will correctly identify all cases where the list is sorted in ascending order. It will also handle descending sorted lists correctly because sorting an already descending list will still match the original list. Therefore, the function works as expected for all potential cases related to checking if a list is sorted.
