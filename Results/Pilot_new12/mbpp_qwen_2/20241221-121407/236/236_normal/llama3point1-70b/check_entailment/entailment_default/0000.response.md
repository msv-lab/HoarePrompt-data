Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in ascending order. The function `func_1` compares the original list `nums` with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. If both lists are identical, it means the original list was already sorted in ascending order, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach works for all potential cases, including an empty list, which is considered sorted, and lists with duplicate values. The code handles these cases as expected without any issues. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
