Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` does not handle the case where the list is sorted in descending order. The annotated version confirms that the function compares the original list to its sorted version, which will only yield `True` if the original list was already sorted in ascending order. Therefore, a list like `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` would be incorrectly identified as unsorted. The annotated version also highlights this issue and supports the original assessment.
