Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not by using a list of month numbers that have 31 days. The function returns `True` if the given month number is in the list, and `False` otherwise. This logic covers all the potential cases as per the problem description, and there are no edge cases or examples found where the program does not work as expected.
