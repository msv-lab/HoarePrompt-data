Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an integer `n` as input, which should represent a month number between 1 and 12, and returns `True` if `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days. The function uses a list `months_31_days` containing the integers representing the months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). By checking if `n` is in this list, the function accurately determines whether the input month has 31 days. Since the function handles all possible valid inputs within the specified range (1 to 12) and returns the correct boolean value based on the presence of `n` in the list, it fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
