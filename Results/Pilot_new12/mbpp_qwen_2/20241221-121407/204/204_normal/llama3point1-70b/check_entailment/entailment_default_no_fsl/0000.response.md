Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given month number `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days. The function uses a list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]` which accurately represents the month numbers of January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. Since the problem description asks for a function that returns `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise, and the function does exactly that without any missing functionalities or edge cases, the code is correct for every potential case.
