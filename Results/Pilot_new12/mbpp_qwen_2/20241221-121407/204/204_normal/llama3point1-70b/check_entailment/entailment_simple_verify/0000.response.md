Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not by using a list of month numbers that have 31 days. The annotations confirm that the function returns `True` if the input month number `n` is in the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`, and `False` otherwise. Since the input `n` is assumed to be an integer within the range 1 to 12, the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs according to the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
