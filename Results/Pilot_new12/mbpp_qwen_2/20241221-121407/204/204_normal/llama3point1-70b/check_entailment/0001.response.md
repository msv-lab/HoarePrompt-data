Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. According to the problem description, the function should return `True` if the month number is in the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`, which are the month numbers that have 31 days. 

- For month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, the function returns `True` as expected.
- For other month numbers (2, 4, 6, 9, 11), the function returns `False` as expected.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential month numbers, it is correct according to the problem description.
