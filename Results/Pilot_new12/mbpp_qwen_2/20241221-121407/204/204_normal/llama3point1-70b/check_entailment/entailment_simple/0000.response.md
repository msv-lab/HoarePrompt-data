Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether the given month number `n` (which is an integer between 1 and 12) contains 31 days. The program uses a list `months_31_days` containing the numbers corresponding to the months that have 31 days. It then checks if `n` is in this list. If `n` is found in the list, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This exactly matches the problem description, as it correctly identifies months with 31 days for all valid inputs within the range 1 to 12.
