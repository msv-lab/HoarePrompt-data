Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether the given month number `n` contains 31 days. The function returns `True` if `n` is in the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`, which are the month numbers that have 31 days, and `False` otherwise. Since the function behaves as expected for all potential valid inputs (month numbers between 1 and 12), the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
