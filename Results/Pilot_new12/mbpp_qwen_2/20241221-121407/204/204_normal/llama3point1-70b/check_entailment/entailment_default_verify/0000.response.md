Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not by comparing the input `n` against a list of month numbers that have 31 days. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` for month numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, and `False` for all other inputs. Since the problem description and the provided code match perfectly, and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is valid.
