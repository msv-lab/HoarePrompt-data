Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not by using a list of month numbers that have 31 days. The function returns `True` if the given month number is in the list, and `False` otherwise. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as intended, covering all the potential cases as per the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
