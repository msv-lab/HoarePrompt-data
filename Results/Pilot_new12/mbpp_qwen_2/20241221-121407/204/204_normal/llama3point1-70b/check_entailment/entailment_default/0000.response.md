Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether the given month number `n` contains 31 days. It does this by checking if `n` is in the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`, which correctly represents the month numbers of the months with 31 days. The function returns `True` if `n` is in this list and `False` otherwise. This matches the problem description perfectly, and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code. Therefore, the program works correctly for every potential case.
