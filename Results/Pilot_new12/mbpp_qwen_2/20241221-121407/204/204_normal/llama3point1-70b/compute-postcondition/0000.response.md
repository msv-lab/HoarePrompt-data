The code initializes a list `months_31_days` containing the integers `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`. This list does not affect the value of `n`, which remains an integer such that `1 <= n <= 12`. Therefore, the only variable that is updated is the list `months_31_days`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 12; `months_31_days` is [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]**
