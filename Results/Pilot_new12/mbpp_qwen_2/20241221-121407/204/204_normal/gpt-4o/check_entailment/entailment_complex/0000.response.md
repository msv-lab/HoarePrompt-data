Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It defines a set of months that contain 31 days (`months_with_31_days`) and checks if the given `month` is in this set. If the `month` is found in the set, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The provided test cases cover all the months that either have 31 days or do not, and the function passes all these tests. Since the function accurately determines whether a given month has 31 days as per the problem description, the program is correct.
