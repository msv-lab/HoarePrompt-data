Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given month number contains 31 days by checking if the month is in the set `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for those without. The provided test cases in the assertions cover all the necessary scenarios, including January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), December (12), February (2), June (6), and January (1) again. Since the function handles these cases correctly and the problem description requires identifying months with 31 days, the program meets the requirements.
