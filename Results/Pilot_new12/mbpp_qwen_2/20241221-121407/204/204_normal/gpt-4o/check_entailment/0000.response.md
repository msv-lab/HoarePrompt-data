Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies months with 31 days by checking if the given month number is in the set `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`. The assertions provided cover several cases, including January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), December (12), February (2), June (6), and January (1) again. Since the function returns `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for those without, and the provided test cases are all handled correctly, the function meets the problem description for all potential cases.
