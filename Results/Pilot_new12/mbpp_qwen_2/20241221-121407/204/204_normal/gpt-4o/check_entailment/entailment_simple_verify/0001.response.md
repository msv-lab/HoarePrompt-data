Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` checks if the given month number is in the set of months that have 31 days. The test cases provided cover all the months, and the function returns the expected results for each month. The logic within the function is sound, and the annotations support the correctness of the program. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
