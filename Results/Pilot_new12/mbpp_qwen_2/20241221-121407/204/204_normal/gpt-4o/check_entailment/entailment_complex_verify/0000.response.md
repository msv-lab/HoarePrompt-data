Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly identifies months with 31 days by checking if the given month number is in the set `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`. The annotated version confirms that the function only accepts integers between 1 and 12 and returns `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for those without. The provided assertions cover all the relevant cases and are handled correctly by the function. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
