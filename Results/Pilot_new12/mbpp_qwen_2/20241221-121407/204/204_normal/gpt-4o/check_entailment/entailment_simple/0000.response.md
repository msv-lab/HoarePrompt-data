Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether the given month number contains 31 days or not by checking if the month is in the set `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`. This set correctly includes all months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December). The function returns `True` if the month is in this set and `False` otherwise.

The provided test cases assert the expected behavior for various month numbers, confirming that the function works as intended:

- `func_1(5)` returns `True` because May has 31 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` because February does not have 31 days.
- `func_1(6)` returns `False` because June does not have 31 days.
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` because January has 31 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `True` because December has 31 days.
- `func_1(11)` returns `False` because November does not have 31 days.

Since the function's logic and the test cases align with the problem description, the program is correct.
