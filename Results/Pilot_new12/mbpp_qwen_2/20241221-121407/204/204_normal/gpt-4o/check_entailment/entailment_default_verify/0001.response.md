Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies months with 31 days by checking if the given month number is in the set of months with 31 days. The provided test cases cover a range of months, both those with 31 days and those without, and the function passes all these tests. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting an integer within the range of 1 to 12 and returning `True` for months with 31 days and `False` otherwise. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the output hints, and the provided code logic is sound. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
