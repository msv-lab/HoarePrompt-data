Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies months with 31 days. It uses a set to store the month numbers (1-12) that have 31 days and checks if the given month number is in this set. The test cases provided cover several months, both those with 31 days and those without. Since the function works as expected for these test cases and the logic is sound, it can be concluded that the function is correct for every potential case.
