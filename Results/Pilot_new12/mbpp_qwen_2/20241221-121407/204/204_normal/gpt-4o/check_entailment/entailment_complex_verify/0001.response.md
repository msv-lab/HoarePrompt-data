Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function that checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The provided function `func_1` uses a set to store the month numbers that have 31 days and correctly checks if the given month number is in this set. The annotated version clearly shows that the function works as intended, returning `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for those without. The test cases provided cover all relevant months and the function passes them correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.
