Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given month number contains 31 days by using a set of month numbers that have 31 days. The function returns `True` for months 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, and `False` for other months. The assertions provided cover all the months from 1 to 12, and the function behaves as expected based on the problem description and output hints. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
