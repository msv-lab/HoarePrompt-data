Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks whether a given month number contains 31 days by checking if the month is in the set `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`. The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` if the month is one of these values and `False` otherwise. Given the assertions and the output hints, the function works correctly for all potential cases of month numbers between 1 and 12.
