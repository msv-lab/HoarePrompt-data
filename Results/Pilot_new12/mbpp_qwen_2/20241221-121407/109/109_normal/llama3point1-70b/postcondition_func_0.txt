The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both lists. It modifies `list1` based on whether it is empty or not. If `list1` is not empty, the last element of `list1` is replaced with the entire content of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it is replaced entirely with `list2`. The function returns the modified `list1`. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `list1` contains more than one element, only the last element is updated with `list2`, and the rest of `list1` remains unchanged. There is no action taken on elements other than the last one.
- The annotation suggests that `list1` should retain its original length if it is not empty and `list2` is shorter than one element, but the code does not handle this scenario explicitly. If `list2` is shorter than one element, the last element of `list1` is replaced with an empty list or a list containing only falsy values, depending on the content of `list2`.
- The function does not check if `list2` is empty or contains only falsy values, and it directly assigns `list2` to `list1` without considering these cases.
