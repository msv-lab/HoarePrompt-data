Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the function `func_1`. 

- If `list1` is non-empty and contains more than one element, the last element of `list1` is replaced by `list2`, and `list2` retains its original contents.
- If `list1` has exactly one element, that single element is replaced entirely by `list2`.
- If `list1` is empty, it is correctly updated to `list2`.

In all scenarios, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. The annotations correctly reflect the state transitions of the variables within the function, confirming that the function operates as intended. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
