Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`) if `list1` is not empty. If `list1` is empty, it is assigned the value of `list2`. This behavior aligns with the problem description, which requires the function to replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. The annotations support the correctness of the program under all potential cases.
