Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`). It handles both cases where `list1` is not empty and where it is empty. If `list1` is not empty, it replaces the last element. If `list1` is empty, it assigns `list2` to `list1`. This satisfies the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
