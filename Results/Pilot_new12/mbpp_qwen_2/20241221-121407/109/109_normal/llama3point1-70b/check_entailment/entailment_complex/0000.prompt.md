You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in two lists and replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if list1 :
        list1[-1:] = list2
    else :
        list1 = list2
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists. If `list1` is not empty, then the last element of `list1` is replaced by `list2`, and `list2` retains its original contents. If `list1` is empty or contains only falsy values, then both `list1` and `list2` are empty or contain only falsy values.
    return list1
    #`list1` contains the contents of `list2` if `list1` was not empty, otherwise `list1` is empty or contains only falsy values
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both lists. It modifies `list1` based on whether it is empty or not. If `list1` is not empty, the last element of `list1` is replaced with the entire content of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it is replaced entirely with `list2`. The function returns the modified `list1`. 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `list1` contains more than one element, only the last element is updated with `list2`, and the rest of `list1` remains unchanged. There is no action taken on elements other than the last one.
- The annotation suggests that `list1` should retain its original length if it is not empty and `list2` is shorter than one element, but the code does not handle this scenario explicitly. If `list2` is shorter than one element, the last element of `list1` is replaced with an empty list or a list containing only falsy values, depending on the content of `list2`.
- The function does not check if `list2` is empty or contains only falsy values, and it directly assigns `list2` to `list1` without considering these cases.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
