Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and replaces the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.
2. **Handling Non-empty List1**: If `list1` is not empty, the code replaces the last element of `list1` with the entire `list2`. This ensures that the last element of `list1` is updated with the elements from `list2`.
3. **Handling Empty List1**: If `list1` is empty, the code assigns `list2` to `list1`. This effectively replaces `list1` with the elements of `list2`.

The provided program correctly handles both scenarios described in the problem description:
- When `list1` is not empty, the last element is replaced by the entire `list2`.
- When `list1` is empty, it is completely replaced by `list2`.

While the program does not explicitly handle edge cases such as `list2` being shorter than one element or `list1` containing multiple elements (only the last one is updated), these scenarios do not contradict the problem description, which only specifies replacing the last element of `list1` with the elements of `list2`.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
