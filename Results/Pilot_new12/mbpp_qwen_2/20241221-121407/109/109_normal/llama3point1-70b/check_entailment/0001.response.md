Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`) for all potential cases:

1. If `list1` is non-empty and has more than one element, the function correctly replaces the last element with `list2`.
2. If `list1` has exactly one element, it is replaced entirely by `list2`.
3. If `list1` is empty, it is correctly updated to `list2`.

In all scenarios, the function adheres to the problem description, making it correct.
