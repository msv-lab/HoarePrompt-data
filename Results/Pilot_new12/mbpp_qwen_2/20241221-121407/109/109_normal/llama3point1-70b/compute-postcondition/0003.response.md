The code `list1 = list2` assigns the value of `list2` to `list1`. This means that `list1` now points to the same list object as `list2`. If `list2` was initially an empty list or contained only falsy values, then `list1` will also be an empty list or contain only falsy values. The initial value of `list2` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is an empty list or contains only falsy values; `list2` is an empty list or contains only falsy values**
