The code `list1[-1:] = list2` replaces the last element of `list1` (a sublist containing only the last element) with `list2`. Since `list2` can contain multiple elements, the last element of `list1` will be replaced by `list2`.

Given that `list1` is not empty, let's denote the last element of `list1` as `last_element_list1` and the contents of `list2` as `elements_list2`.

After executing the code, the last element of `list1` will be replaced by `list2`, effectively making the last element of `list1` equal to `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` is the original list except its last element is now `list2`; `list2` retains its original contents**
