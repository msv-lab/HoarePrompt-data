Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list that includes all elements of `list1` except the last element, followed by all elements of `list2`. This function effectively concatenates `list2` to the end of a modified version of `list1`, where the last element of `list1` is removed. The function handles the case where `list1` is empty, in which case it simply returns `list2`. If `list2` is empty, the function returns a list that contains all elements of `list1` except the last one.**

This summary covers the actual behavior of the function based on the code, including handling edge cases such as when `list1` or `list2` is empty.
