The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists. After executing the function body, it returns a list that contains all elements of `list1` except the last element, followed by all elements of `list2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a new list that includes all elements of `list1` except the last element, followed by all elements of `list2`.
