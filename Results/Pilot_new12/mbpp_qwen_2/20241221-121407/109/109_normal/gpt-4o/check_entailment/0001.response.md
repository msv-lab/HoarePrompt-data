Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list. The function logic is as follows:

- It uses `list1[:-1]` to get all elements of `list1` except the last one.
- It concatenates this with `list2`, effectively replacing the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`.

The assertions provided cover different scenarios including lists of different lengths and even a single-element list in `list2`. Since the function works as expected in all given cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
