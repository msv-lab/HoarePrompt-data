Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. Specifically, the function takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) and returns a new list where the last element of `list1` is replaced by the elements of `list2`.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Handling of Last Element**: The function uses slicing (`list1[:-1]`) to get all elements of `list1` except the last element. This ensures that the last element is excluded from the final output.
2. **Concatenation with `list2`**: After removing the last element from `list1`, the function concatenates `list2` to the resulting list. This achieves the goal of replacing the last element of `list1` with all elements of `list2`.
3. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases such as when `list1` or `list2` is empty. When `list1` is empty, the function returns `list2`, and when `list2` is empty, the function returns a list with all elements of `list1` except the last one.

Given these points, the function consistently meets the requirements of the problem description for any valid inputs, hence the correctness is **True**.
