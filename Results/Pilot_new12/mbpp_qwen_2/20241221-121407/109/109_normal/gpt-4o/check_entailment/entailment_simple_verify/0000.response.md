Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with all the elements of the second list. The provided examples and the annotated version confirm that the function behaves as intended. The function uses list slicing and concatenation to achieve this, and the examples demonstrate that it handles different types of inputs (integers and strings) correctly. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
