The code calculates the median of the `merged_list` by taking the average of the two middle elements. Since the size of the merged list is even, `middle_index` is `size - 1`. The two middle elements are `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`. The median is calculated as their average.

- `merged_list` remains a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in sorted order.
- `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged.
- `middle_index` remains `size - 1`.
- `median` is assigned the value \((merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2\).

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in sorted order, `list1` is unchanged, `list2` is unchanged, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, `median` is \((merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2\)**.
