The code assigns the value of `size - 1` to `middle_index`. Here, `size` refers to the length of the `merged_list`, which is the combined length of `list1` and `list2`. Since `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged and `merged_list` is the sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, the value of `size` is the sum of the lengths of `list1` and `list2`. However, the exact numerical value of `size` is not provided, so we express `middle_index` in terms of `size`.

Output State: **`merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in sorted order, `list1` is unchanged, `list2` is unchanged, `middle_index` is `size - 1`**
