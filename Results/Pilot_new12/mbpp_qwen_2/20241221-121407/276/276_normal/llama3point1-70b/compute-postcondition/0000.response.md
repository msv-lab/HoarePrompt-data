The code concatenates `list1` and `list2` and then sorts the resulting list. Since both `list1` and `list2` are already sorted and have the same size, the merged and sorted list will contain all elements from both lists in sorted order. However, the original lists `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged. The variable `merged_list` is assigned the sorted concatenated list.

Output State: **`merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in sorted order, `list1` is unchanged, `list2` is unchanged**
