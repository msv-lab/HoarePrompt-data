The code assigns the value at the `middle_index` of the `merged_list` to the variable `median`. Given that `middle_index` is `size - 1` and `size` is odd, the `middle_index` is the index of the middle element in the `merged_list`. Since the `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in sorted order, the `middle_index` is the exact middle element of this combined list.

Therefore, `median` is assigned the value of the element at index `size - 1` in `merged_list`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in sorted order, `list1` is unchanged, `list2` is unchanged, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, `size` is odd, `median` is the element at index `size - 1` in `merged_list`.**
