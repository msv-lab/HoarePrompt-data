The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers with the same size, and `size` is a positive integer. If `size` is even, the function returns the median calculated as `(merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2`; if `size` is odd, it returns the element at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists of integers `list1` and `list2` with the same size and a positive integer `size`, and return the median of the combined list based on whether the total number of elements is odd or even.
