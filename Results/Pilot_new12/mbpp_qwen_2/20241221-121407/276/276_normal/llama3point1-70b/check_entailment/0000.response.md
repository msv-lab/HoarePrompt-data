Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the input lists are empty. If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the program will raise an error when trying to access elements in the merged list. Additionally, the program assumes that both input lists are of the same size, but it does not explicitly check this condition. Here is an example where the program fails:

```python
list1 = []
list2 = [1]
size = 1
```

In this case, the program will raise an error because it tries to access an element in an empty list. To fix this, you should add checks for empty lists and ensure both lists are of the same size before proceeding with the merging and calculation of the median.
