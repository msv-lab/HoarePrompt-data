You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (size), and size is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in sorted order, `list1` is unchanged, `list2` is unchanged, `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is \((merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2\). If `size` is odd, `median` is the element at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median which is calculated as (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2 if size is even, or the element at index middle_index in merged_list if size is odd
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, with the same size, and a positive integer `size`. It merges these two lists into a single sorted list, `merged_list`, and calculates the median of this merged list. If the total number of elements (`size`) is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle element. The function does not modify the input lists `list1` and `list2`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the calculated median.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
