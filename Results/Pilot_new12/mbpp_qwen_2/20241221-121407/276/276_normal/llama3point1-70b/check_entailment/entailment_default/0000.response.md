Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the merged list has an even number of elements. Specifically, the `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which is incorrect. For a list of even length, the middle indices should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`.

Here is the corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size // 2 - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index + 1]
    return median
```

In the original code, when `size` is even, the function calculates the middle index incorrectly, leading to an incorrect median calculation. For example, if `size` is 4, the middle indices should be 1 and 2, but the code incorrectly uses 3 and 3. This discrepancy means the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
