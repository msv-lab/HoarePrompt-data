Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided code does correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size under the assumption that the inputs are valid (as per the output hints), the original assessment correctly points out that the program does not handle the case where one or both of the input lists are empty. This is a critical edge case that should be addressed. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
