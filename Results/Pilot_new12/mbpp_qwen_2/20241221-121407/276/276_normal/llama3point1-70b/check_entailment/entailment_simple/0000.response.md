Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. According to the problem description, `list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size, and `size` is a positive integer. Although the program does not explicitly validate these conditions, the problem statement assumes that the inputs will be valid.

2. **Merging Lists**: The function merges the two input lists into a single sorted list named `merged_list` using the `sorted()` function. This step ensures that the resulting list contains all elements from `list1` and `list2` in sorted order.

3. **Finding Median**: 
   - The function calculates the `middle_index` as `size - 1`.
   - It then checks whether the size of the combined list (`size`) is even or odd.
   - If `size` is even, the median is computed as the average of the elements at indices `middle_index` and `middle_index + 1`.
   - If `size` is odd, the median is simply the element at index `middle_index`.

4. **Output**: The function returns the computed median.

Since the program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem description and handles the median calculation accurately for both even and odd-sized lists, the program is correct.
