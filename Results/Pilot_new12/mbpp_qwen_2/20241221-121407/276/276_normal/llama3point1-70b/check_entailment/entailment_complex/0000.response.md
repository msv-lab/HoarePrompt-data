Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here’s a breakdown of why:

1. **Function Inputs**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both sorted lists of integers, and a third parameter `size`, which is the size of these lists and should be a positive integer. This matches the problem description.

2. **Merging Lists**: The function merges `list1` and `list2` into a new list `merged_list` using the `sorted` function. This ensures that `merged_list` contains all elements from both `list1` and `list2` in sorted order. Since both input lists are already sorted, their concatenation and subsequent sorting will result in a single sorted list.

3. **Calculating Median**: 
   - If the size of the merged list is even, the function calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements.
   - If the size of the merged list is odd, the function returns the middle element directly.
   - The middle index `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which is correct for finding the middle element(s) in a zero-indexed list.

4. **Output**: The function returns the calculated median, which aligns with the problem description.

5. **Preservation of Input Lists**: The function does not modify the input lists `list1` and `list2`, which is consistent with the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**: While the problem description assumes valid inputs, the function’s approach inherently handles the cases where the lists are of the same size and contain integers. No additional checks for edge cases like empty lists or invalid types are necessary because the problem statement specifies valid inputs.

Given these points, the program correctly follows the problem description for all valid cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
