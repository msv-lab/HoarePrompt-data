Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` has a logical error when calculating the median for an even-sized list. The index `middle_index` is set to `size - 1`, which is incorrect because the middle indices for an even-sized list should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`. This will lead to incorrect median calculation. For example, consider two sorted lists `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`. The merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, and the middle indices should be `1` and `2`. However, the current implementation uses `middle_index = size - 1`, which is `1` for this case but will fail for larger lists. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
