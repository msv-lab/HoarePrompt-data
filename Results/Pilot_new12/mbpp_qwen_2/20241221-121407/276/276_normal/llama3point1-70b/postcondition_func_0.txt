The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, with the same size, and a positive integer `size`. It merges these two lists into a single sorted list, `merged_list`, and calculates the median of this merged list. If the total number of elements (`size`) is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle element. The function does not modify the input lists `list1` and `list2`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns the calculated median.
