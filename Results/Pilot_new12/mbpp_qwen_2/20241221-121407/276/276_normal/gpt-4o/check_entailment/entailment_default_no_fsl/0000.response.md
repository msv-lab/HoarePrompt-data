Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It merges the two lists into one sorted list, then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. The code handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list appropriately. Since the problem description specifies that the lists are sorted, of the same size, and `n` is a positive integer, the provided code meets these requirements. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code fails to handle, so the program is correct.
