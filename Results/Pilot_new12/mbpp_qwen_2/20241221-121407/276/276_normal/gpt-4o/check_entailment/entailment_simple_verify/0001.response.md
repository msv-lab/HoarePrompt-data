Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The annotations provide a clear understanding of the state of the program at different points, supporting the correctness of the function. The function merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. Since the lists are of the same size, the median calculation is handled correctly, whether the total number of elements is even or odd. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function passes them correctly. Therefore, the function appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, confirming the original assessment is accurate.
