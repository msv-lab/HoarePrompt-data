Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The provided output hints confirm that the function merges and sorts the lists, calculates the median based on the length of the merged list, and handles the cases where the length is even or odd. The function passes the given test cases, which validate its ability to correctly compute the median under the specified conditions. The output hints do not indicate any issues with the provided code, and the original assessment accurately reflects the function's correctness given the problem description and the assumptions about valid input.
