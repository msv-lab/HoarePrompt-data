Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` aims to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The annotated version confirms that the function correctly merges the two lists, sorts them, and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function. Specifically, the function handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list correctly by calculating the average of the middle two elements for even lengths and the middle element for odd lengths. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
