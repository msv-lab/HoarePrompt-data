Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided code and the annotated version, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The annotations describe the state of the program accurately at different points, confirming that the function merges the two lists, sorts them, and then finds the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles both even and odd total lengths of the combined list appropriately, and the provided test cases confirm its correctness. Therefore, no specific counterexample was found where the program fails to meet the problem description. The function is correct under the assumption that the inputs are valid as per the problem statement.
