Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, and the function passes them correctly. The annotated version supports this by detailing the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function behaves as expected. While the function assumes that the input lists are of the same size and are valid, the problem description and the provided assertions do not require the function to handle invalid inputs beyond ensuring the lists are of the same size. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
