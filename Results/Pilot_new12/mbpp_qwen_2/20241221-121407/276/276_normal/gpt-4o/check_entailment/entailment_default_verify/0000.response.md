Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided function `func_1` calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts them, and then computes the median based on the length of the merged list. The function handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list appropriately by averaging the middle two elements for even lengths and selecting the middle element for odd lengths. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected under the given assumptions about valid inputs. Since the function meets the problem description and the provided test cases validate its correctness, the original assessment is accurate.
