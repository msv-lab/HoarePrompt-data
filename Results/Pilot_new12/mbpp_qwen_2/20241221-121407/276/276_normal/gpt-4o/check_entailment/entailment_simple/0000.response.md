Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists (`list1` and `list2`) and an integer `n` (which is the size of each list). The function does not directly use `n` but implicitly uses the lengths of the lists, which is appropriate as the lists are already sorted and of the same size.

2. **Merging and Sorting**: The program merges the two sorted lists into one list called `merged_list` using `sorted(list1 + list2)`. Since both input lists are sorted and of the same size, their concatenation and subsequent sorting result in a correctly merged and sorted list.

3. **Finding the Median**: The program correctly calculates the median:
   - If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of the middle two elements.
   - If the length of `merged_list` is odd, the median is the middle element.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although not explicitly tested in the provided assertions, the program handles edge cases such as:
   - Both lists being empty (though this case is not covered by the assertions).
   - Lists having the same size but with different values.

Since the program performs the necessary operations to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size as described in the problem statement, and it does so correctly without any logical errors, the program is correct. Therefore, the output should be "Correctness: True".
