Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The function merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and then finds the median based on the length of the merged list. Since the lists are of the same size, the median will always be the average of the middle two elements if the total number of elements is even, or the middle element if the total number of elements is odd. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function passes them correctly. Therefore, the function appears to handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
