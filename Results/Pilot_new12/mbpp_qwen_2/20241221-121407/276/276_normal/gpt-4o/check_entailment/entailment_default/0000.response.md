Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It merges the two lists, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median based on the length of the merged list. The code handles both even and odd lengths of the merged list appropriately by returning the average of the two middle elements for even lengths and the single middle element for odd lengths. The assertions provided in the problem description confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Since the code does not have any explicit checks for edge cases like different list sizes or invalid inputs (as mentioned, we assume valid inputs), and it correctly implements the required functionality, the program is correct for every potential case.
