Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes valid inputs (both lists are sorted and of the same size). The provided code does not explicitly validate these conditions, but this is acceptable according to the problem statement, which states that we assume valid input.

2. **Merging and Sorting**: The function merges the two input lists (`list1` and `list2`) into a single list (`merged_list`) and sorts it. This step ensures that the combined list is sorted, which is necessary for finding the median.

3. **Median Calculation**: 
   - If the length of the merged list is even, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements.
   - If the length is odd, the median is the middle element.
   
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed median.

Given the problem description and the assumptions made, the function correctly calculates the median of the two sorted lists. Therefore, the program is correct.
