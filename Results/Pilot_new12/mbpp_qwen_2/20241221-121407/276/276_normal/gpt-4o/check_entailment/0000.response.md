Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The approach of merging the two lists and then finding the median works for all potential cases since both input lists are already sorted. The function handles both even and odd total lengths of the combined list appropriately by calculating the average of the middle two elements for even lengths and the middle element for odd lengths. All provided test cases also confirm its correctness. Therefore, no specific counterexample was found where the program fails to meet the problem description.
