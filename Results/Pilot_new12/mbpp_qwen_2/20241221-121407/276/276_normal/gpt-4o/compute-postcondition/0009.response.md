Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size `n`, merges and sorts them into a new list `merged_list`, calculates the median of `merged_list`, and returns it. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of the middle two elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element. This function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer and both `list1` and `list2` are non-empty and of equal length. If `list1` or `list2` were not of the same length or if `n` was not a positive integer, the function would fail due to incorrect handling of these conditions, but the provided code does not explicitly check for these edge cases.**

Note: The code assumes that `list1` and `list2` are of the same size and `n` is a positive integer. It does not handle cases where `n` is not positive or `list1` and `list2` are not of equal length.
