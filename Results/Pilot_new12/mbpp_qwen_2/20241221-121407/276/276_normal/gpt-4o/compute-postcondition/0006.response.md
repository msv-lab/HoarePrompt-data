Postcondition: ***`list1` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` concatenated and sorted, `mid` is n, and `median` is either the average of the elements at indices `mid - 1` and `mid` in `merged_list` if the length of `merged_list` is even, or the element at index `mid` in `merged_list` if the length of `merged_list` is odd.***
