The code calculates the median of the `merged_list` by taking the average of the two middle elements, which are `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`. Since `merged_list` is a sorted list of all elements from `list1` and `list2` concatenated and sorted, and its length is even, the values of `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]` are the two middle elements of this list.

Given that the length of `merged_list` is even, `mid` is the index just before the middle element, and the next element is the middle one. Thus, `merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]` are the two middle elements.

The `median` is calculated as their average. No other variables are affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state includes the calculation of `median`.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` concatenated and sorted, `mid` is n, the length of `merged_list` is even, and `median` is equal to (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2.**
