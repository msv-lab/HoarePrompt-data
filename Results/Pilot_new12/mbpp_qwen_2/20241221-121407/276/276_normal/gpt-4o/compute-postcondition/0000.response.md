The code concatenates `list1` and `list2` and then sorts the resulting list. The `merged_list` is assigned the sorted version of this concatenated list. Since the original lists (`list1` and `list2`) are not modified, they retain their initial state.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size n, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` concatenated and sorted.**
