The code `median = merged_list[mid]` assigns the value of the middle element in the `merged_list` to the variable `median`. Since `merged_list` is a sorted list with an odd number of elements and `mid` is equal to `n`, which is half the length of `merged_list` rounded down, `median` will be the element at index `n` in the `merged_list`.

Given that `merged_list` is sorted and has an odd number of elements, the median will be the element exactly in the middle.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` concatenated and sorted, `mid` is n, the length of `merged_list` is odd, `median` is the element at index n in `merged_list`**
