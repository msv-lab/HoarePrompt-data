The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers with the same size `n`, and `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the program returns the median of the merged and sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, which is either the average of the elements at indices `mid - 1` and `mid` if the length of `merged_list` is even, or the element at index `mid` if the length of `merged_list` is odd.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size `n`, merge and sort them, and then return the median of the resulting list.
