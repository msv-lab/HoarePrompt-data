The code assigns the midpoint index of `merged_list` to the variable `mid`. Since `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` concatenated and sorted, the length of `merged_list` is `2 * n` (as each list has `n` elements). Therefore, the value of `mid` will be `(2 * n) // 2`, which simplifies to `n`.

The other variables (`list1`, `list2`, and `merged_list`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` concatenated and sorted, `mid` is n**
