#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of integers with the same size n, and n is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `merged_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` concatenated and sorted, `mid` is n, and `median` is either the average of the elements at indices `mid - 1` and `mid` in `merged_list` if the length of `merged_list` is even, or the element at index `mid` in `merged_list` if the length of `merged_list` is odd.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged and sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, which is either the average of the elements at indices `mid - 1` and `mid` if the length of `merged_list` is even, or the element at index `mid` if the length of `merged_list` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size `n`, merges and sorts them into a new list `merged_list`, calculates the median of `merged_list`, and returns it. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of the middle two elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element. This function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer and both `list1` and `list2` are non-empty and of equal length. If `list1` or `list2` were not of the same length or if `n` was not a positive integer, the function would fail due to incorrect handling of these conditions, but the provided code does not explicitly check for these edge cases.
