Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the occurrence and position of the substring within the given string. It returns the substring along with its start and end positions. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`, which aligns with the problem description. There doesn't appear to be any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. Therefore, the function works as expected for all potential cases based on the given problem description.
