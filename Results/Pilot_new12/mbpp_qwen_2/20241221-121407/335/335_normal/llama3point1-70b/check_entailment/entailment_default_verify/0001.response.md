Final: **False**

Reason: Although the original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` finds the occurrence and position of the substring within the string and returns `None` if the substring is not found, the output hints provide a more detailed analysis that reveals an issue with the calculation of the `end` index. Specifically, the function returns `end - 1` instead of the correct `end` index, which is `start + len(substring) - 1`. This discrepancy means that the function does not accurately represent the end position of the substring, making it incorrect according to the problem description and the intended behavior based on the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to reflect this error.
