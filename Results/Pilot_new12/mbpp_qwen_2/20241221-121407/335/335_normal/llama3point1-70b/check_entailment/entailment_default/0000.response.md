Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. According to the problem description, the function should return `None` if the substring is not found. However, the current implementation returns the substring along with its start and end indices even when the substring is not found. Specifically, when `find()` returns `-1`, indicating the substring is not found, the code incorrectly returns the substring itself along with invalid indices (`start` and `end`). The function should return `None` in such cases to meet the problem description accurately.
