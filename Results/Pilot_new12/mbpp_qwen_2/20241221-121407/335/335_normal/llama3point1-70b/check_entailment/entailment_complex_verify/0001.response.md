Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring and calculates the ending index correctly. The annotated version further clarifies that the function returns `None` if the substring is not found and provides the correct indices when the substring is found. Therefore, the program is correct.
