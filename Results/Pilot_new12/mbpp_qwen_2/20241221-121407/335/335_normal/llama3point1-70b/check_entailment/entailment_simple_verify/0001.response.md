Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of the substring within a string. 

- When the substring is found (`start != -1`), the function returns a tuple containing the substring, its start index, and its end index (correctly adjusted).
- When the substring is not found (`start == -1`), the function correctly returns `None`.

The annotated version supports this reasoning by clearly indicating the state of the program at different points. Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct remains accurate.
