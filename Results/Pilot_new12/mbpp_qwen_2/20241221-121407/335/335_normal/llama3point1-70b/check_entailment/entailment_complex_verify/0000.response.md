Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the occurrence and position of the substring within the given string. It returns the substring along with its start and end positions if the substring is found, and returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The annotated version clearly shows that the function behaves as expected in both cases where the substring is found and not found. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
