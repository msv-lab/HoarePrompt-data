Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly handles both cases where the substring is found and where it is not. When the substring is found, the function returns the substring along with its start and end positions, adjusted to be inclusive of the start and exclusive of the end. When the substring is not found, the function correctly returns `None`. The annotations support the correctness of the function according to the problem description, which requires the function to find the occurrence and position of the substring and return `None` if there is no match.
