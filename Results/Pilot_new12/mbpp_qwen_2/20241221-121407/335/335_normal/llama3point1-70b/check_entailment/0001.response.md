Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index of the substring and calculates the ending index correctly. Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases (including when the substring is not present), the program is correct.
