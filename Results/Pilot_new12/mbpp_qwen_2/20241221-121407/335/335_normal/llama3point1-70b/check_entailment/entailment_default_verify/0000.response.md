Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is not entirely accurate. While the function `func_1` does correctly identify the occurrence and position of the substring within the given string, there is a logical error in how the end index is calculated. Specifically, the line `return (substring, start, end - 1)` should return `end` instead of `end - 1` to accurately represent the end index of the substring. This error is evident from the output hints provided, where it mentions that the `end` index is incorrectly calculated as `len(substring) - 2` when the substring is not found. This discrepancy means the function does not fully meet the problem description, leading to the final assessment being False.
