Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function is expected to return the occurrence and position of the substring within the string, but the current implementation returns a tuple containing the substring itself, its starting index, and the ending index minus one. 

The problem description requires the function to return `None` if there is no match, but the provided implementation returns a tuple with indices and the substring, even when the substring is not found. This means that the function does not correctly handle cases where the substring is not present in the string.

Here's an example where the program fails to meet the requirements:

```python
string = "hello world"
substring = "python"
result = func_1(string, substring)
print(result)  # Output: ('python', -1, -2)
```

In this case, the substring "python" is not found in the string "hello world", so the function should return `None`, but instead, it returns a tuple containing the substring and invalid indices.

To correct the program, it should be modified to return `None` when the substring is not found:

```python
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return substring, start, end - 1
```

With this modification, the function will correctly return `None` when the substring is not found, meeting the problem description requirements.
