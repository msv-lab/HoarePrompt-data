Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not fully meet the problem description. Specifically, the problem description states that the function should return the substring, its starting index (`start`), and its ending index (`end`). However, the function only returns `None` when the substring is not found, and when the substring is found, it incorrectly returns the substring, the start index (-1 when not found), and the end index (`len(substring) - 2` when not found). This does not align with the requirement to return the substring, its start index, and its end index when the substring is found. The correct approach would be to return a tuple containing the substring and its start and end indices. For example:

```python
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    else:
        end = start + len(substring)
        return substring, start, end - 1
```

With this correction, the function will correctly return the required information as per the problem description.
