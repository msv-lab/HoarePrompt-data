Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`, both of which are strings. It searches for the first occurrence of `substring` within `string`. If `substring` is found, it returns `substring` along with the `start` and `end` indices of its first occurrence. If `substring` is not found, it returns `None`. 

- In Case_1, if `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns `None`.
- In Case_2, if `substring` is found in `string`, the function returns `substring`, the `start` index of the first occurrence of `substring` (which is `-1` when not found), and the `end` index (which is `len(substring) - 2` when not found).

Thus, the function aims to locate a substring within a given string and provide the substring along with its starting and ending indices if found, or return `None` if the substring is not present.**

This summary captures the actual behavior of the function based on the code and the provided annotations, including all relevant edge cases.
