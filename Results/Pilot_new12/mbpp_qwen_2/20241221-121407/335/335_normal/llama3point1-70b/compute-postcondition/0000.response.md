The `find` method is called on the `string` with `substring` as the argument. This method returns the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`. If `substring` is not found, it returns -1. The value of `start` is set to this result. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, or -1 if `substring` is not found in `string`.**
