`end` is assigned the value of `start + len(substring)`. Since `start` is -1 (as `start != -1` is false), the value of `end` will be `-1 + len(substring)`, which simplifies to `len(substring) - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `start` is -1, `end` is `len(substring) - 1`.

Output State: **`string` is a string, `substring` is a string, `start` is -1, `end` is `len(substring) - 1`**
