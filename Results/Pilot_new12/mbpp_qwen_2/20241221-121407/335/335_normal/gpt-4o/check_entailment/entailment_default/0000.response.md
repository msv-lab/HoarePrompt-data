Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `main_string` and `sub_string`, and returns the substring along with its starting and ending positions if it is found in the main string. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`. The code uses the `find` method to locate the substring, which handles all potential cases, including when the substring is not present in the main string. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected in all given scenarios. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
