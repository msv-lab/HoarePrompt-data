Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` only returns the first occurrence of the substring along with its start and end positions. According to the problem description, the function should find all occurrences of the substring and their positions, but the current implementation only handles the first occurrence. The output hints confirm this behavior, indicating that the function returns a single tuple for each occurrence instead of a list of tuples. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
