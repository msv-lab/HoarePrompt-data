Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string. It returns `None` if the substring is not found.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - When the substring is found, the function returns a tuple containing the substring itself, its starting index, and its ending index.
   - When the substring is not found, the function correctly returns `None`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions cover different scenarios:
     - A simple case where the substring `'python'` is found in the main string `'python programming, python language'`.
     - A case where the substring `'programming'` is found in the main string `'python programming,programming language'`.
     - Another case where the substring `'language'` is found in the main string `'python programming,programming language'`.
     - A case where the substring `'python'` is not found in the main string `'c++ programming, c++ language'`, which should return `None`.

4. **Logic**:
   - The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting position of the substring in the main string.
   - If `find` returns `-1`, indicating the substring is not found, the function returns `None`.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the ending position by adding the length of the substring to the starting position and returns the substring along with its indices.

Given these points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality and handles all edge cases mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
