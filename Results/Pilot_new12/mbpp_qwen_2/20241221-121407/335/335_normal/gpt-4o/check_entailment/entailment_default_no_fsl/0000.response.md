Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not return the correct position for the ending index (`end_pos`). According to the code, `end_pos` is calculated as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`. However, the ending index should actually be `start_pos + len(sub_string) - 1` because string indexing is zero-based and the end position is exclusive.

For example, consider the following test case:

```python
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
```

The expected output should be `('python', 0, 5)` because the substring "python" ends at index 5. The current implementation returns `('python', 0, 6)`, which is incorrect.

Similarly, for the case:

```python
assert func_1('python programming, programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
```

The expected output should be `('programming', 7, 16)` because the substring "programming" ends at index 16. The current implementation returns `('programming', 7, 18)`, which is also incorrect.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
