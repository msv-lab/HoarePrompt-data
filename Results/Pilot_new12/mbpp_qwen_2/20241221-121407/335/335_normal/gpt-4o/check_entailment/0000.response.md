Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the occurrence and position of substrings within a string. It returns the substring along with its starting and ending positions if found, and `None` otherwise. The function handles all the given test cases correctly:

1. For the input `('python programming, python language', 'python')`, it correctly returns `('python', 0, 6)`.
2. For the input `('python programming,programming language', 'programming')`, it correctly returns `('programming', 7, 18)`.
3. For the input `('python programming,programming language', 'language')`, it correctly returns `('language', 31, 39)`.
4. For the input `('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python')`, it correctly returns `None`.

Since the function behaves as expected for all the provided test cases and the problem description, and no edge cases were found where the function does not work as intended, the program is correct.
