Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It searches for a substring within a main string and returns the substring along with its starting and ending positions if found, and `None` otherwise. The function handles all the given test cases correctly, and the output hints align with the expected behavior of the function. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
