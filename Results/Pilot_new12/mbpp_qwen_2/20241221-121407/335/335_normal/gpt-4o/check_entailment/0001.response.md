Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not handle the case where the substring appears multiple times in the main string. Specifically, the function only returns the first occurrence of the substring along with its start and end positions. However, the problem description asks for finding all occurrences of the substring and their positions.

For example, consider the following input:

```
assert func_1('python programming, programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
```

The expected output should be a list of tuples indicating all occurrences of the substring, but the current implementation only returns the first occurrence. Therefore, the function is not correct according to the problem description.
