Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature and Inputs:**
   - The function `func_1` takes two string arguments: `main_string` and `sub_string`.
   - The function aims to find the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`.

2. **Finding Substring:**
   - The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting index (`start_pos`) of `sub_string` within `main_string`.
   - If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, `find` returns `-1`. In this case, the function correctly returns `None`.

3. **Returning Values:**
   - If `sub_string` is found, the function calculates the ending index (`end_pos`) as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`.
   - It then returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, `start_pos`, and `end_pos`.

4. **Test Cases:**
   - The test cases provided cover different scenarios:
     - When the substring is found at the beginning of the main string.
     - When the substring is found in the middle of the main string.
     - When the substring is found at the end of the main string.
     - When the substring is not found in the main string.

5. **Consistency with Problem Description:**
   - The function correctly returns the substring along with its starting and ending positions when the substring is found.
   - When the substring is not found, it correctly returns `None`.

Since the function `func_1` adheres to the problem description and handles all the specified scenarios accurately, the correctness of the program is **True**.
