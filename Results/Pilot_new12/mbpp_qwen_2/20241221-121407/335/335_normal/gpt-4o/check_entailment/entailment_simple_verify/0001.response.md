Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` only returns the first occurrence of the substring along with its start and end positions, even though the problem description asks for finding all occurrences of the substring and their positions. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `None` or a single tuple indicating the first occurrence of the substring. Since the function does not handle cases where the substring appears multiple times, it fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being `False` is maintained.
