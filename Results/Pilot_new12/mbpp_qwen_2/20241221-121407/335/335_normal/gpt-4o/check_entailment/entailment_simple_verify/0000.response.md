Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string. The annotations clearly indicate that the function behaves as expected in all cases:

1. For the input `('python programming, python language', 'python')`, the function correctly returns `('python', 0, 6)`.
2. For the input `('python programming,programming language', 'programming')`, it correctly returns `('programming', 7, 18)`.
3. For the input `('python programming,programming language', 'language')`, it correctly returns `('language', 31, 39)`.
4. For the input `('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python')`, it correctly returns `None`.

The function uses the `find` method to locate the starting position of the substring and calculates the ending position based on the length of the substring. The annotations confirm that the function returns `None` when the substring is not found and returns the substring along with its starting and ending positions when found. There are no discrepancies between the annotations and the problem description, supporting the original assessment of correctness.
