Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` only returns the first occurrence of the substring along with its start and end positions. The problem description, however, requires the function to find all occurrences of the substring and return them in a list of tuples. Since the function does not meet this requirement, the original assessment of the program's correctness being False is maintained.
