The code calculates the sum of the `rounded_numbers` list and assigns it to the variable `total_sum`. The `rounded_numbers` list is unchanged, and the `numbers` list remains the same. The `total_sum` variable is introduced and assigned the sum of the rounded values of the elements in `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`.**
