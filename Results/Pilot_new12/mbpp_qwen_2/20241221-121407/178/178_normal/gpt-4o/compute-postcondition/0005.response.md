Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (floating-point or integer), rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the input list, and returns the result. It handles an empty list by returning 0, as the sum of an empty list is 0 and multiplying by the length (which is also 0) still results in 0. No other edge cases are explicitly handled in the code, but the function correctly processes the given list according to its specification.**
