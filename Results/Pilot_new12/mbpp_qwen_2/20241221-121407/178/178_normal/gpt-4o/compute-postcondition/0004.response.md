The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of floating-point or integer numbers. The function calculates the total sum of the elements in the list after rounding each element to the nearest integer, then multiplies this total sum by the length of the `numbers` list. The function returns the result of this calculation.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of numbers (floating-point or integers), round each number to the nearest integer, calculate the sum of these rounded numbers, multiply this sum by the length of the list, and return the result.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the list, and returns the result.**
