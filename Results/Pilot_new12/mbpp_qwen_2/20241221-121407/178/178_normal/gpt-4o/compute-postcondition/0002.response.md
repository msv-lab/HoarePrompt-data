The code `result = total_sum * len(numbers)` assigns the value of `total_sum` multiplied by the length of the `numbers` list to the variable `result`. This operation does not change the values of `numbers`, `rounded_numbers`, or `total_sum`. The only new variable created is `result`, which is the product of `total_sum` and the length of `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of floating-point or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`; `result` is the value of `total_sum * len(numbers)`**
