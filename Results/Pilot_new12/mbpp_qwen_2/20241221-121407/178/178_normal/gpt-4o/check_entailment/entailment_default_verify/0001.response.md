Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic of rounding each number in the list, calculating the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplying the sum by the length of the list. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. While the output hints mention that the function does not explicitly handle edge cases like non-list inputs or non-numeric values, the problem description does not specify handling such cases. Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the input is assumed to be valid, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
