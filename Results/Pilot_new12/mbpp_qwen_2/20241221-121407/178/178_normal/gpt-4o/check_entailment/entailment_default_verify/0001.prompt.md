You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the given list, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The provided test cases also seem to validate this behavior:

1. For the input `[22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]`, the rounded numbers are `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 17]`. The sum is `243`, and multiplying by the length (9) gives `243 * 9 = 243`.
2. For the input `[5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]`, the rounded numbers are `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]`. The sum is `71`, and multiplying by the length (5) gives `71 * 5 = 355` (the provided assertion seems to have a typo; it should be `355` instead of `345`).
3. For the input `[25.0, 56.7, 89.2]`, the rounded numbers are `[25, 57, 89]`. The sum is `171`, and multiplying by the length (3) gives `171 * 3 = 513`.

Given these examples and the logic implemented in the function, the program seems to handle the problem correctly for the provided cases and no edge cases were found where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (floating-point or integer), rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the input list, and returns the result. It handles an empty list by returning 0, as the sum of an empty list is 0 and multiplying by the length (which is also 0) still results in 0. No other edge cases are explicitly handled in the code, but the function correctly processes the given list according to its specification.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
