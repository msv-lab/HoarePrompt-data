Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic of rounding each number in the given list, calculating the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplying this sum by the length of the list. The provided test cases validate this behavior, although there is a minor typo in the second assertion where the expected result should be `355` instead of `345`. However, this does not affect the overall correctness of the program. The annotated version also correctly describes the behavior of the function, confirming that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
