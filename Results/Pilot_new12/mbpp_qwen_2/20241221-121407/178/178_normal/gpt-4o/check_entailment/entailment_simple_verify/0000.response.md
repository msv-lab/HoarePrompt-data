Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` rounds each number in the given list and then calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers. It then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The provided annotations support this behavior, stating that the program returns `result` which is the value of `total_sum * len(numbers)`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers` and `len(numbers)` is the length of the `numbers` list. 

Given the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the program behaves as expected and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The assertions provided in the original assessment also confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program's correctness remains **True**.
