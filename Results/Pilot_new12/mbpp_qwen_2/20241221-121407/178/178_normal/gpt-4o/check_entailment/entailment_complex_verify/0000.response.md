Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the list, and returns the result. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including lists with floating-point numbers and integer values, and the function passes all these tests. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected and correctly processes the input according to its specification. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
