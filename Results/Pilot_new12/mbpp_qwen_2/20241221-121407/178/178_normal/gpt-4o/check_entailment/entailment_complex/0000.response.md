Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is designed to take a list of numbers (either floating-point or integers), round each number to the nearest integer, calculate the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiply this sum by the length of the input list. 

2. **Rounding Logic**: The line `rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]` correctly rounds each element in the input list to the nearest integer. 

3. **Sum Calculation**: The variable `total_sum` is calculated as the sum of the rounded numbers using `sum(rounded_numbers)`. This ensures that the sum is the total of all the rounded values.

4. **Result Calculation**: The final result is computed as `total_sum * len(numbers)`, which multiplies the sum of the rounded numbers by the length of the input list.

5. **Edge Case Handling**: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention handling edge cases such as an empty list, the function handles this gracefully by simply calculating the sum of an empty list as 0, and then multiplying by the length (also 0), resulting in 0. This aligns with the mathematical interpretation of the problem.

Given the above points, the function consistently performs the operations as specified in the problem description for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
