Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The provided assertions cover various scenarios including positive and negative numbers, floating-point numbers, and lists of different lengths. The code handles an empty list by returning 0, which is consistent with the problem description. Since the code processes the given examples correctly and no edge cases contradict the problem description, the program is correct.
