You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` rounds each number in the given list and then calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers. Finally, it multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The assertions given in the problem statement cover various scenarios, including lists with floating-point numbers and integer values. Based on the provided examples and the logic of the function, the program appears to meet the requirements for all tested cases. Since no specific edge cases or counterexamples were found where the program does not work as described, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of floating-point or integer numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #`The program returns result which is the value of total_sum * len(numbers)`, where `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers` and `len(numbers)` is the length of the `numbers` list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (floating-point or integer), rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, multiplies this sum by the length of the input list, and returns the result. It handles an empty list by returning 0, as the sum of an empty list is 0 and multiplying by the length (which is also 0) still results in 0. No other edge cases are explicitly handled in the code, but the function correctly processes the given list according to its specification.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
