Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the code. The function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling both non-empty and empty lists appropriately. Since the assertions and the logic of the function match the problem description, and there are no edge cases or specific issues highlighted by the output hints that would indicate otherwise, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
