Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, sums these rounded numbers, multiplies the sum by the length of the list, and returns the result. The code handles the case of an empty list by returning 0, as the sum of an empty list is 0 and multiplying by the length (which is also 0) still results in 0. The assertions provided in the problem description confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
