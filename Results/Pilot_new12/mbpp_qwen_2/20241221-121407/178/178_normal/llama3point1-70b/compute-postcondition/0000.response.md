The code snippet `[round(num) for num in numbers]` creates a new list `rounded_numbers` where each element is the rounded version of the corresponding element in the original `numbers` list. Since the exact values in `numbers` are not provided, we can only express the elements of `rounded_numbers` in terms of the rounded versions of the elements of `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats); `rounded_numbers` is a list where each element is the rounded version of the corresponding element in `numbers`.**
