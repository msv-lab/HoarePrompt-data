Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code and the original program implementation match the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The annotation correctly reflects the behavior of the function, confirming that it performs the required operations as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** remains valid.
