Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description and handles all potential cases appropriately. The function rounds each number in the input list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling both positive and negative numbers and floating-point numbers correctly. Additionally, the function returns `0` for an empty list, which aligns with the problem description and the logic of the function. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
