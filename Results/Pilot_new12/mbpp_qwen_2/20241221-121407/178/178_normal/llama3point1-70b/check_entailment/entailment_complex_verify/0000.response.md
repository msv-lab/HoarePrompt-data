Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list and then returns the total sum of these rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list. The annotated version supports this by stating that the function handles both positive and negative numbers correctly and accounts for floating-point numbers. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input list is empty, but as stated in the problem description and assumptions, we assume valid input, so this edge case is not a concern for the correctness assessment. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
