Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to round every number in the given list and then print the total sum of these rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list. 

- The annotation "numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats)" matches the problem description.
- The code correctly rounds each number in the list using a list comprehension.
- The sum of the rounded numbers is calculated.
- The result is returned as the sum of the rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list.

Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate. Therefore, the final assessment is **True**.
