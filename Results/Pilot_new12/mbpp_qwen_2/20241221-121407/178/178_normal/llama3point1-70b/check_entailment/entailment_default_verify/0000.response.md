Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` rounds each number in the given list and then returns the total sum of these rounded numbers multiplied by the length of the list. The output hints confirm that the function handles both positive and negative numbers and floating-point numbers correctly. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input list is empty, but the behavior of returning zero in such a case aligns with the mathematical definition of multiplying the sum of an empty list by its length. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
