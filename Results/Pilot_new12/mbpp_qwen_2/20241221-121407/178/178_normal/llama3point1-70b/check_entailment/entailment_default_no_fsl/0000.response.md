Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should round every number in the given list and then print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. However, the function simply returns the result without printing it, and it returns 0 for an empty list, which does not match the requirement to print the result. For an empty list, the expected behavior would be to print nothing or an appropriate message, but the current implementation does not meet this requirement.
