Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number to the nearest integer using list comprehension, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the input list. This process is consistent with the problem description, which requires rounding every number in the list and printing the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. The program handles both positive and negative numbers correctly and works for lists of integers or floats. Since the problem description does not specify handling for invalid inputs like non-lists or empty lists, and we are assuming valid inputs, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
