Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function as described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer using list comprehension, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the list. This process works for all potential cases, including lists containing positive numbers, negative numbers, and floating-point numbers. The code handles the case of an empty list correctly, returning zero, as the sum of an empty list is zero and multiplying by the length (which is also zero) results in zero. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
