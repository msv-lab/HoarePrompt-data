Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The annotated version further clarifies that the function rounds each number in the input list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. This behavior is consistent across all cases mentioned, including an empty list, where the function returns `0`. The annotated version also notes that the function handles both positive and negative numbers as well as floating-point numbers correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
