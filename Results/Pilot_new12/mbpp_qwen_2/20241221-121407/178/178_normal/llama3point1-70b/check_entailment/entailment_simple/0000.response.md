Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It takes a list of numbers (either integers or floats), rounds each number in the list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the original list. The function returns the final result. Since the problem description specifies that the function should meet all these steps, and the provided function does exactly that, the function is correct according to the given problem description.
