Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It rounds each number in the input list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. There doesn't seem to be any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling, as it works for any list of numbers, including integers, floats, and empty lists. Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown:

- For an empty list, the function returns `0`, which is correct since the sum of an empty list is `0` and multiplying by the length (which is also `0`) gives `0`.
- For a list of integers or floats, the function correctly rounds each number, sums them up, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the list.

Since the function meets the requirements for all potential cases, the correctness is `True`.
