You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It rounds each number in the input list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. There doesn't seem to be any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling, as it works for any list of numbers, including integers, floats, and empty lists. Hereâ€™s a brief breakdown:

- For an empty list, the function returns `0`, which is correct since the sum of an empty list is `0` and multiplying by the length (which is also `0`) gives `0`.
- For a list of integers or floats, the function correctly rounds each number, sums them up, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the list.

Since the function meets the requirements for all potential cases, the correctness is `True`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (integers or floats) as input and returns the sum of the rounded values of these numbers, multiplied by the length of the input list. The function first rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer using list comprehension. Then, it calculates the sum of the rounded numbers and multiplies this sum by the length of the original list. This process handles both positive and negative numbers correctly and accounts for floating-point numbers. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty; in such a case, the returned value would be zero since the sum of an empty list is zero and multiplying by the length (which is also zero) results in zero.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
