#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #`The program returns the sum of the elements in 'rounded_numbers' multiplied by the length of the list 'numbers'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of numbers (integers or floats) as input and returns the sum of the rounded values of these numbers, multiplied by the length of the input list. The function first rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer using list comprehension. Then, it calculates the sum of the rounded numbers and multiplies this sum by the length of the original list. This process handles both positive and negative numbers correctly and accounts for floating-point numbers. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty; in such a case, the returned value would be zero since the sum of an empty list is zero and multiplying by the length (which is also zero) results in zero.
