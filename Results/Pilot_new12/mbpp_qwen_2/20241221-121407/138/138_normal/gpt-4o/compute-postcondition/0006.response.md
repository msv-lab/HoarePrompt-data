Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least two elements, `element` is the element being searched for in the list, `index` is 1, `value` is the second element in the list. If the value is equal to `element`, the function returns `True` and `index` which is 1. Otherwise, the function does not return anything since there is no else part.***
