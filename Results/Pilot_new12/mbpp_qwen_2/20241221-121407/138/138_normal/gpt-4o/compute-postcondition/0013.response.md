Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is the element being searched for in the list. It iterates through the list to find the specified element. If the element is found, it returns `True` and the index of the element in the list. If the element is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`.**

**Specifically:**
- **Case 1:** If the element is found at the first position (index 0), the function returns `True` and `0`.
- **Case 2:** If the element is found at the second position (index 1), the function returns `True` and `1`.
- **Case 3:** If the element is found at the third position (index 2), the function returns `True` and `2`.
- **Case 4:** If the element is not found in the list, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- The function assumes that the list `arr` is not empty. If `arr` is empty, the function will return `False` and `-1` because the loop will not execute, and the initial return statement will be reached. This case is covered by the provided postconditions.
