The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is the element being searched for in the list. The function returns different outcomes based on the index of the found element within the list. Specifically:

- Case_1: The function returns `True` and the index `0`.
- Case_2: The function returns `True` and the index `1`.
- Case_3: The function returns `True` and the index `2`.
- Case_4: The function returns `False` and the index `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `element`, and return whether `element` is found in `arr` along with its index, or indicate that it was not found with an index of `-1`.
