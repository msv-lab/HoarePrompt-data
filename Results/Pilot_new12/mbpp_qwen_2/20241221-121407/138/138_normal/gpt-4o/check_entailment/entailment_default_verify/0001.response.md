Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to find the specified element and returns the appropriate tuple based on whether the element is found or not. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the output hints accurately summarize the functionality of the code. There are no indications from the problem description, the provided code, or the output hints that suggest any issues with the program's correctness under the given assumptions of valid inputs. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
