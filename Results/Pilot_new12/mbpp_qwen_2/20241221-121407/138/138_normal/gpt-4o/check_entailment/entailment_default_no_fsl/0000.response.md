Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code implements the required functionality correctly. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the element is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and show that the function works as expected for those cases. Since the problem description and the code align, and the examples provided in the output hints match the behavior of the function, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
