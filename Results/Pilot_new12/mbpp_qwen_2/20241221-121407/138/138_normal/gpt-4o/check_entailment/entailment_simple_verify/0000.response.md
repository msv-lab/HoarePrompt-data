Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find if an element exists in the array and returns its index. The annotations support this by showing that the function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value at each step. If the element is found, it returns `(True, index)`, and if the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`. This logic handles all potential cases as per the problem description. The annotations clearly indicate that the function returns `True` and `index` if the element is found and `False` and `-1` otherwise. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
