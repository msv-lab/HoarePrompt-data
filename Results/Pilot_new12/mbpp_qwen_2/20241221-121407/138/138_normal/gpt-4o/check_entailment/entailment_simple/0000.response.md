Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how the program aligns with the description:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (an array) and `element` (the element to search for). This matches the expected input.

2. **Return Type**: The function returns a tuple containing two elements:
   - A boolean indicating whether the `element` is found in the `arr`.
   - The index of the `element` in the `arr`, or `-1` if the element is not found.

3. **Logic**: 
   - The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and value of each element.
   - If the current element (`value`) matches the `element` being searched, the function immediately returns `(True, index)`.
   - If the loop completes without finding the element, the function returns `(False, -1)`.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test various scenarios (including presence and absence of the element) and verify that the function behaves as expected.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the required functionality, ensuring that it always meets the problem description for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
