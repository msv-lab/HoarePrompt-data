Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (a list of elements) and `element` (the element to search for in the list). This matches the problem description.

2. **Return Value**: The function returns a tuple containing two elements:
   - A boolean indicating whether the `element` was found in the `arr`.
   - An integer representing the index of the `element` if found, or `-1` if not found. This aligns with the problem description.

3. **Search Mechanism**: The function uses a `for` loop with `enumerate` to iterate through each element in the list `arr`. If the current element (`value`) matches the `element`, it immediately returns `True` and the index of the matching element.

4. **Fallback Case**: If the loop completes without finding the `element`, the function returns `False` and `-1`. This covers the case where the `element` is not present in the list, which is also in line with the problem description.

Given these points, the function consistently meets the requirements stated in the problem description for all valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
