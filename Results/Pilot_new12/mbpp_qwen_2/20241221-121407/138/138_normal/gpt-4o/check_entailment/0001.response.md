Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`. If the element is not found after checking all elements, it returns `(False, -1)`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including finding the element, not finding the element, and different array lengths. Since the function handles these cases correctly and there are no edge cases identified that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
