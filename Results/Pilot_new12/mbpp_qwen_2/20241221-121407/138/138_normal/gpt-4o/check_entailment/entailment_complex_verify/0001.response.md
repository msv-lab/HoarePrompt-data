Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`. If the element is not found after checking all elements, it returns `(False, -1)`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including finding the element, not finding the element, and different array lengths. The annotations also confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling both found and not found cases appropriately. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
