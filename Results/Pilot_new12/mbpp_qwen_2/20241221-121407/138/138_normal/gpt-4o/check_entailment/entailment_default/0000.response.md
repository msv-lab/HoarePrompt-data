Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple `(True, index)`. If the element is not found, it returns `(False, -1)`. This matches the requirements exactly. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Therefore, the function is correct for every potential case.
