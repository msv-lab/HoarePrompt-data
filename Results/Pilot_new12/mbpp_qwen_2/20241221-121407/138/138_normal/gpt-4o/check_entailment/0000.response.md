Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find if an element exists in the array and returns its index. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value at each step. If the element is found, it returns `(True, index)`. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`. This logic handles all potential cases as per the problem description. There are no examples or edge cases provided that the function does not handle correctly. Therefore, the function is correct.
