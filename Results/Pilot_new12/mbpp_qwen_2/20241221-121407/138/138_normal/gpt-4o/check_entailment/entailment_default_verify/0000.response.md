Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find if an element exists in the array and returns its index. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through the list and returns `True` and the index if the element is found, and `False` and `-1` if the element is not found. The provided test cases also support the correctness of the function. There is no evidence from the annotations or the original assessment that suggests the function is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
