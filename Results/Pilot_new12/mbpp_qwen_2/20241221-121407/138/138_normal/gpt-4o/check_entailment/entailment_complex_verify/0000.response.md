Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version further clarifies the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly iterates through the array using `enumerate` to check if the given element is present. If the element is found, it returns `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the element in the array. If the element is not found, it returns `(False, -1)`. This matches the problem description exactly, and the provided assertions confirm the correctness of the function. The annotations also align with this behavior, indicating that the function handles both cases correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is maintained.
