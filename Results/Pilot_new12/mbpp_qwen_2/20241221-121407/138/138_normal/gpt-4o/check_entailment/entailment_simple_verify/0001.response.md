Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality by iterating through the array using `enumerate` to find the specified element and returning the appropriate tuple. The annotations provided align with the actual behavior of the function, confirming that the function correctly handles cases where the element is found or not found. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
