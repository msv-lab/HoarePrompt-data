The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is the element being searched for in the list. It iterates through the list to find the specified element. If the element is found, it returns `True` and the index of the element in the list. If the element is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`.
