Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Functionality**: The function takes an array (`list of integers`) and an element (`integer`) as inputs. It aims to return a tuple with two elements: a boolean indicating whether the element is found in the array and the index position of the element (or `-1` if not found).

2. **Implementation**:
   - Inside the `try` block, the function uses `array.index(element)` to find the index of the element in the array. If the element is found, it returns `True` and the index.
   - If the element is not found, the `except (ValueError)` block catches the exception and returns `False` and `-1`.

3. **Compliance with Problem Description**:
   - The function handles the case where the element is found by returning `True` and the corresponding index.
   - It also correctly handles the case where the element is not found by returning `False` and `-1`.
   - The function does not need to handle additional edge cases such as invalid inputs (since the problem assumes valid inputs) or other types of exceptions (as `ValueError` is sufficient for this use case).

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases appropriately, the program is correct.
