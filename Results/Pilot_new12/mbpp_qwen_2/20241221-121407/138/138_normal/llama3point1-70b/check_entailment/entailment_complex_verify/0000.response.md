Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides clear insight into the behavior of the function `func_1`. It confirms that the function correctly returns a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index. Specifically, if the element is found, it returns `(True, index)`, and if not found, it returns `(False, -1)`. This matches the problem description exactly, and the exception handling ensures that the function can gracefully handle cases where the element is not found. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
