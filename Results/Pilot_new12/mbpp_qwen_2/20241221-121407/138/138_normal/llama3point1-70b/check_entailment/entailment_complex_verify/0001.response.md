Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It uses the `index` method to find the index of the specified element in the array. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. The annotated version supports this behavior and there are no discrepancies that would lead to the program failing to meet the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
