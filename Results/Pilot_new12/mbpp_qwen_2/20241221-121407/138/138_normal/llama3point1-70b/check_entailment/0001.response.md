Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It uses the `index` method of the list to find the index of the specified element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. This covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There is no scenario where the program would fail to meet the requirements based on the given implementation.
