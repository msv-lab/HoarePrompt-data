Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality. It uses the `index` method to find the index of the specified element in the array. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. This aligns with the problem description and the output hints provided. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being `True` remains valid.
