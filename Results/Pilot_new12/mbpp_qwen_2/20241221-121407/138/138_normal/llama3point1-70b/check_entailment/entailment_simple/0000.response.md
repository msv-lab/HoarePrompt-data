Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `array` (a list of integers) and `element` (an integer), which matches the expected inputs as per the problem description.

2. **Try-Except Block**: 
   - The `try` block attempts to find the index of the `element` within the `array` using the `index()` method. If the element is found, it returns `True` along with the index of the element.
   - The `except (ValueError)` block handles the case where the `element` is not found in the `array`. In this scenario, it returns `False` and `-1`, which is consistent with the problem description.

3. **Return Values**: 
   - When the element is found in the array, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element.
   - When the element is not found, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

4. **Assumptions**: The problem description states that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Given this assumption, the program correctly handles all cases as described.

Since the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, the correctness is **True**.
