Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality by using the `index` method of the list to find the index of the specified element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. The annotated version confirms that the program behaves as expected under both scenarios: finding the element and not finding the element. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
