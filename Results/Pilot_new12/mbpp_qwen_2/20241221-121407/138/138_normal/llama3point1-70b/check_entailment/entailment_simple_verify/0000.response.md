Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index. The function uses a try-except block to handle cases where the element is not found in the array, returning `(False, -1)` in such scenarios. This approach ensures that the function behaves as expected under all valid input conditions. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
