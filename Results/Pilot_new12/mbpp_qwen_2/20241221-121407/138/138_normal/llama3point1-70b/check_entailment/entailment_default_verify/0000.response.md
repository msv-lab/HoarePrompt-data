Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function returns a tuple with a boolean indicating the presence of the element in the array and the index of the element if found. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns `(False, -1)`, which aligns with the problem description and the output hints provided. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
