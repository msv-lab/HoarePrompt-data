Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index. It handles the case where the element is not found by catching the `ValueError` exception and returning `(False, -1)`. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases, making the program correct.
