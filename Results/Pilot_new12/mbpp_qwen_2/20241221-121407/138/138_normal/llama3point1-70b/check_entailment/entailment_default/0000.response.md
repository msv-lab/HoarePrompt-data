Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It returns a tuple where the first element is a boolean indicating whether the element is present in the array, and the second element is the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found. The code handles the case where the element is not present by catching the `ValueError` exception thrown by the `index` method, which is appropriate for this scenario. Given the problem description and the behavior of the `index` method, the code works correctly for every potential case.
