Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `element`. It searches for `element` in `array` and returns `True` along with the index of `element` if found. If `element` is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. The function handles the case where `element` is not present in `array` by catching a `ValueError` exception and returning `False` and `-1`. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `array` is empty, the function will still correctly handle the absence of `element` and return `False` and `-1`.
- If `element` is not an integer, the function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to use `array.index(element)` since the type check is not explicitly performed in the code. However, given the problem statement specifies that `element` is an integer, we assume this is handled elsewhere or the function should only be called with integer inputs.
