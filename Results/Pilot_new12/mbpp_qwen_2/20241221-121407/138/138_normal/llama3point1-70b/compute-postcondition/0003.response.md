Step-by-step analysis:

1. The `try` block attempts to find the index of the `element` in the `array` using the `index()` method.
2. If the `element` is found in the `array`, the `index()` method returns the index of the first occurrence of `element`, and the function returns `True` and that index.
3. If the `element` is not found in the `array`, a `ValueError` is raised because the `index()` method cannot find the specified element.
4. The `except` block catches the `ValueError` and handles it by returning `False` and `-1`.

Summarizing the try-except block:
- The `try` block checks if `element` exists in `array` and returns its index along with `True`.
- The `except` block catches the `ValueError` and returns `False` and `-1` if the element is not found.

Therefore, the output state after the complete execution of the `try` statement is:

Output State: **`array` is a list of integers, and `element` is an integer. The function returns `True` and the index of `element` in `array` if the element is found; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`.**
