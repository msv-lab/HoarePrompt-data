The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array`, which is a list of integers, and `element`, which is an integer. If the `element` is found in the `array`, the function returns `True` along with the index of `element` in `array`. Otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `array` and an integer `element`, and return whether the `element` is found in the `array` along with its index if found, otherwise return `False` and `-1`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `element`, and returns `True` and the index of `element` in `array` if the element is found; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`.**
