#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of integers, and element is an integer.
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return True, index
        #The program returns `True` and `index` which is the index of `element` in `array`
    except (ValueError):
        return False, -1
        #The program returns False and -1
    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: `array` is a list of integers, and `element` is an integer. The function returns `True` and the index of `element` in `array` if the element is found; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `element`. It searches for `element` in `array` and returns `True` along with the index of `element` if found. If `element` is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. The function handles the case where `element` is not present in `array` by catching a `ValueError` exception and returning `False` and `-1`. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.
