The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `array` and an integer `element`. It searches for `element` in `array` and returns `True` along with the index of `element` if found. If `element` is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. The function handles the case where `element` is not present in `array` by catching a `ValueError` exception and returning `False` and `-1`. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.
