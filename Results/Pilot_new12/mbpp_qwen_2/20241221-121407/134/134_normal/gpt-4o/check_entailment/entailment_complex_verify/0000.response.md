Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula \(2^{(n-1)}\) to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for any positive integer \(n\). The provided test cases validate the implementation for several values of \(n\), and the annotations align with the problem description. Since the program consistently returns the correct values and handles the input as specified, the program is correct according to the problem description.
