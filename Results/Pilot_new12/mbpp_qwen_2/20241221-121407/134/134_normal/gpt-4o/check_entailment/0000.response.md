Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients using the formula \(2^{n-1}\). This formula is derived from the binomial theorem, where the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients in the expansion of \((1+1)^n\) is \(2^{n-1}\).

Given the test cases:
- `func_1(4)` returns `8`, which is \(2^{4-1} = 2^3 = 8\).
- `func_1(6)` returns `32`, which is \(2^{6-1} = 2^5 = 32\).
- `func_1(2)` returns `2`, which is \(2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2\).

Since the program consistently returns the correct values for the given inputs and the formula holds true for all positive integers \(n\), the program meets the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
