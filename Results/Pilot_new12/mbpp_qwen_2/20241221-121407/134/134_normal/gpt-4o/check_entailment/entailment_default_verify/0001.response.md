Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is the sum of the even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The test cases provided (with inputs 4, 6, and 2) confirm that the function behaves as expected. The output hints also align with the functionality of the program, indicating that the function handles the required inputs and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
