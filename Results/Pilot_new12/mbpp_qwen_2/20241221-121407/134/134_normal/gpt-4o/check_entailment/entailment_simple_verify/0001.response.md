Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is the sum of the even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The annotated version provides clear states and reasoning, supporting the correctness of the function. The provided test cases validate the function's implementation, and the annotations align with the expected behavior. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
