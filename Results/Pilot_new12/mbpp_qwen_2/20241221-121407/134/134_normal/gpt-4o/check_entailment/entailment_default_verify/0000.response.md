Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the formula \(2^{n-1}\) to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The test cases confirm that the function returns the expected results. The output hints further validate that the function behaves as intended, returning \(2^{(n-1)}\) for any valid positive integer input. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints align with the expected behavior, the original assessment of the program's correctness is correct.
