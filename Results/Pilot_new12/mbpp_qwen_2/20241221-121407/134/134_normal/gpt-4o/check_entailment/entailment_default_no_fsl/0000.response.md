Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is not the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients. For a given \(n\), the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients is actually equal to \(2^{(n-1)}\), but this formula only holds true for the sum of even-indexed terms in the expansion of \((1+1)^n\), which simplifies to \(2^n / 2 = 2^{(n-1)}\). However, the problem asks for the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients directly, which requires a different approach.

To verify, consider \(n=2\):
- Binomial coefficients for \(n=2\) are \([1, 2, 1]\).
- Even-indexed coefficients are \([2]\).
- Sum of even-indexed coefficients is \(2\).

However, the function returns \(2^{(2-1)} = 2^1 = 2\), which is correct for this specific example. But for \(n=3\):
- Binomial coefficients for \(n=3\) are \([1, 3, 3, 1]\).
- Even-indexed coefficients are \([1, 3]\).
- Sum of even-indexed coefficients is \(1 + 3 = 4\).

But the function returns \(2^{(3-1)} = 2^2 = 4\), which is also correct for this specific example. The issue arises when considering the general correctness. The function does not differentiate between the sum of even-indexed coefficients and the direct application of the formula \(2^{(n-1)}\).

A correct implementation would involve calculating the binomial coefficients and summing only those at even indices, which is not what the current function does. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.
