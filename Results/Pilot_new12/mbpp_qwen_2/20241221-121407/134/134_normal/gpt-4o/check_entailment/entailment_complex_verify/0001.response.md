Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is indeed the sum of the even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \(n\). The test cases provided in the annotated version confirm the correctness of the function. The annotations also support the correctness by stating that the function returns \(2\) raised to the power of \((n-1)\), which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
