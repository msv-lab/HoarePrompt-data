Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a positive integer `n` and returns \(2^{(n-1)}\). This function correctly implements the logic to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given `n`. The binomial coefficient \(\binom{n}{k}\) for even indices can be shown to sum up to \(2^{(n-1)}\), which is a well-known result in combinatorics.

The provided assertions test the function with different values of `n` and the results match the expected outputs. The output hints confirm that the function returns \(2^{(n-1)}\) for any positive integer `n`, and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
