Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The problem requires a function that takes a positive integer \( n \) and returns the sum of even index binomial coefficients. For a positive integer \( n \), the sum of even index binomial coefficients is given by \( 2^{(n-1)} \).

The provided function `func_1(n)` returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \), which matches the required functionality. The assertions in the comments also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases:

- \( \text{func}_1(4) = 2^{(4-1)} = 2^3 = 8 \)
- \( \text{func}_1(6) = 2^{(6-1)} = 2^5 = 32 \)
- \( \text{func}_1(2) = 2^{(2-1)} = 2^1 = 2 \)

Since the function consistently returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \) for any positive integer \( n \), it correctly meets the problem description.
