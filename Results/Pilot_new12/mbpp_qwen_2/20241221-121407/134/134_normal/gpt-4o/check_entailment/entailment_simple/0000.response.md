Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python function that takes a positive integer \( n \) and returns the sum of even-index binomial coefficients. For a positive integer \( n \), the sum of even-index binomial coefficients can be shown to be \( 2^{n-1} \). The given function `func_1` correctly implements this formula by returning \( 2^{(n - 1)} \).

Let's verify the provided test cases:
- For \( n = 4 \), the sum of even-index binomial coefficients is \( 2^{4-1} = 2^3 = 8 \).
- For \( n = 6 \), the sum of even-index binomial coefficients is \( 2^{6-1} = 2^5 = 32 \).
- For \( n = 2 \), the sum of even-index binomial coefficients is \( 2^{2-1} = 2^1 = 2 \).

These results match the expected outputs from the test cases, confirming that the function behaves as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
