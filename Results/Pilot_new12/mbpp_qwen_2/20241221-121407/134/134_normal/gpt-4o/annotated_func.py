#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1), where n is a positive integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which must be a positive integer, and returns \(2^{(n-1)}\). There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. After the function executes, the program state is such that the function returns the value of \(2\) raised to the power of \((n-1)\).
