The code initializes a variable `sum` to 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged since no operation is performed on `n`. The variable `sum` is assigned the value 0. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `sum` and the unchanged value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0**
