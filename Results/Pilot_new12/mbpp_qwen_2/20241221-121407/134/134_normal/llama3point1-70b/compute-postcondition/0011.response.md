Let's analyze the given loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `sum` is 0.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        sum += math.comb(n, i)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
   - For each iteration, if `i` is even, `math.comb(n, i)` is added to `sum`.

2. **Final State Calculation**:
   - Since the loop iterates through all integers from `0` to `n`, `i` will take all even values from `0` to `n` (if `n` is even) or up to `n-1` (if `n` is odd).
   - For each even `i`, `math.comb(n, i)` is added to `sum`.

### Final Output State:
- After the loop completes, `sum` will be the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from `0` to `n`.
- If `n` is even, the loop will add `math.comb(n, 0)`, `math.comb(n, 2)`, ..., `math.comb(n, n)`.
- If `n` is odd, the loop will add `math.comb(n, 0)`, `math.comb(n, 2)`, ..., `math.comb(n, n-1)`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop has executed all its iterations is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from `0` to `n`.**
