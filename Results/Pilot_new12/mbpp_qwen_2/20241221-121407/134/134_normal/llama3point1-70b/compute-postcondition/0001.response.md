State before the loop starts: `n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop is defined as `for i in range(n + 1):`.
2. The range function generates numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the stop value. Therefore, the loop will run from `i = 0` to `i = n`.
3. For the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be at least 1 because `range(n + 1)` will generate numbers from 0 to `n`, and if `n` is 0, the range will be empty, meaning no iterations will occur.
4. The variable `sum` is mentioned but is not directly involved in determining whether the loop can execute. Its initial value of 0 does not affect the loop's execution conditions.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is 0**
