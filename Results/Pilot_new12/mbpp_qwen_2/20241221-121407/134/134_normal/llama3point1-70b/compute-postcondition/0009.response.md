`sum` is incremented by `math.comb(n, i)`. The value of `i` is the smallest odd number greater than the last even number processed, which means `i` was previously an even number and now it is the next odd number. The initial state tells us that `sum` includes the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` where `i` is even, and now it will also include `math.comb(n, i + 1)` because `i + 1` is the next odd number. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0; `sum` is the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` where `i` is even and includes `math.comb(n, i) + math.comb(n, i + 1)`**
