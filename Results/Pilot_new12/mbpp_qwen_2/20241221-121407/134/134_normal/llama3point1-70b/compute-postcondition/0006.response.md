`i` is the smallest odd number greater than the last even number. Given that `n` is an integer greater than 0, let's assume the last even number was `k`. The next odd number after `k` would be `k + 1`. Since `i` is the smallest odd number greater than the last even number, `i` is `k + 1`.

The code updates `sum` by adding `math.comb(n, i)`, which is the binomial coefficient of `n` choose `i`.

Given that `i` is now `k + 1`, the updated `sum` will be `sum + math.comb(n, k + 1)`.

The output state will reflect this change:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0; `sum` is the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` where `i` is even plus `math.comb(n, k + 1)`; `i` is the smallest odd number greater than the last even number.**
