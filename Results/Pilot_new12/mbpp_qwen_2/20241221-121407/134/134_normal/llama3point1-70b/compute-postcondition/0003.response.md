`sum` is updated by adding the value of `math.comb(n, i)` to its current value. Since `i` is even and greater than 0, and `n` is greater than 0, the value of `math.comb(n, i)` is calculated. However, without specific values for `n` and `i`, we can only express the updated sum in terms of these values. The initial state of `sum` is 0, so the new value of `sum` is `math.comb(n, i)`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `sum` is `math.comb(n, i)`, the current value of `i` is even**
