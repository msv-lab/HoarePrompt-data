#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `sum` is the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from `0` to `n`.
    return sum
    #The program returns sum which is the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even i from 0 to n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, a positive integer, and computes the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`. The function iterates through the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), checking if each index `i` is even using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it adds the result of `math.comb(n, i)` to the variable `sum`. After the loop completes, the function returns the value of `sum`. This function will correctly handle all positive integers `n` and will return the expected sum of combinations for even indices. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.
