Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The annotated version supports this by detailing the state of the program and explaining the logic step-by-step. The function iterates through all indices from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index \( i \) is even, and if so, adds the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{i} \) to the sum. This aligns perfectly with the problem description and there are no apparent issues or edge cases that the function does not handle. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
