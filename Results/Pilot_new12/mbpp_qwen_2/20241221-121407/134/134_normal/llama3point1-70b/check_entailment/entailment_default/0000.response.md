Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients for even indices in the range from 0 to `n`. The code iterates through the range, checks if the index `i` is even using the condition `i % 2 == 0`, and adds the result of `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum. This process ensures that all even indices are considered, and the function will return the correct sum for any valid positive integer `n`. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code, and it adheres to the problem description for every potential case.
