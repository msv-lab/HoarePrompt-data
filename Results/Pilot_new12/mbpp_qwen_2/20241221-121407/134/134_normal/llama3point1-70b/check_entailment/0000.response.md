Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The program iterates through all possible indices from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index is even, and if so, adds the corresponding binomial coefficient to the sum using `math.comb(n, i)`. This approach ensures that only even-indexed coefficients are included in the sum, which aligns with the problem description. There doesn't appear to be any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. Therefore, the program is correct for the given problem description.
