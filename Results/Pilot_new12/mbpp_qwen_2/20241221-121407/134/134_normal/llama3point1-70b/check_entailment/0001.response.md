Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The function iterates through all indices from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index \( i \) is even using `i % 2 == 0`, and if so, adds the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{i} \) to the sum. This logic aligns with the problem description, which requires finding the sum of even index binomial coefficients. Since the function handles all even indices up to \( n \) and uses the correct combinatorial formula, it should work for any positive integer \( n \) without missing any cases or edge scenarios.
