Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a positive integer \( n \) as input and calculates the sum of binomial coefficients \( \binom{n}{i} \) for all even indices \( i \) from 0 to \( n \). Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer, as specified in the problem description.
2. **Sum Calculation**: A variable `sum` is initialized to 0. The function then iterates over the range from 0 to \( n \) (inclusive). For each even index \( i \) (determined by the condition `i % 2 == 0`), it adds the value of `math.comb(n, i)` to `sum`.
3. **Output**: After the loop, the function returns the computed sum, which is the sum of binomial coefficients for all even indices.

The explanation in the comments accurately reflects the logic and purpose of the function, ensuring that the implementation matches the problem description for all valid positive integers \( n \). Therefore, the program is correct.
