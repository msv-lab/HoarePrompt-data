Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The provided output hints further confirm that the function iterates through all indices from 0 to \( n \), checks if each index \( i \) is even using the condition `i % 2 == 0`, and adds the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{i} \) to the sum if the condition is met. The function handles all even indices up to \( n \) and uses the correct combinatorial formula. Given that the problem description asks for the sum of even index binomial coefficients, and the code accurately implements this requirement, the original assessment is accurate and the program is correct.
