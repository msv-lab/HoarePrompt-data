Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of binomial coefficients for even indices from `0` to `n`. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes that the input `n` is a positive integer, and the code does not explicitly validate this condition. However, the assumption holds that the input will be valid, as stated in the guidelines.

2. **Loop Execution**: The function uses a for loop to iterate through each index `i` from `0` to `n`. For each even index, it adds the corresponding binomial coefficient (`math.comb(n, i)`) to the variable `sum`.

3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, the condition `if i % 2 == 0:` ensures that only even indices are considered.

4. **Return Value**: After executing the loop, the function returns the computed sum, which is the sum of binomial coefficients for all even indices from `0` to `n`.

Given these points, the program consistently adheres to the problem description without any deviations or missing cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
