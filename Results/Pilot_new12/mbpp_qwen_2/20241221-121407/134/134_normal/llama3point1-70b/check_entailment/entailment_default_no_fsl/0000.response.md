Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates through the range from 0 to `n`, checks if the index `i` is even, and if so, adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum. Since the problem description asks for the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer `n`, and the code accurately performs this task for all even indices from 0 to `n`, the program meets the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the code is correct.
