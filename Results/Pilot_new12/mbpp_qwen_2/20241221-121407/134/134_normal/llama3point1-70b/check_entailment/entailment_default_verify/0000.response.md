Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of even-index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The code iterates through all indices from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index is even, and adds the corresponding binomial coefficient to the sum. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected and handles all positive integers correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities that would make the original assessment inaccurate. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
