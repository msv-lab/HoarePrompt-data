Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function `func_1` takes an input `degrees`, which can be either a float or an integer, and returns the corresponding value in radians. The provided assertions test the function with different inputs (90, 60, and 120 degrees), and the results match the expected values (1.5707963267948966, 1.0471975511965976, and 2.0943951023931953 radians, respectively).

Since the code follows the problem description for every potential case and the provided examples and output hints confirm its correctness, the program is correct.
