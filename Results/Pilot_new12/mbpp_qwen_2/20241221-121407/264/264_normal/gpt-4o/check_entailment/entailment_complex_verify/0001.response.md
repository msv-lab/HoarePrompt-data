Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The provided assertions confirm the correctness of the function for the tested cases (90, 60, and 120 degrees), and the annotations align with the function's behavior, stating that it takes a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees and returns the equivalent value in radians. There are no edge cases or issues mentioned in the annotations that would render the function incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** remains valid.
