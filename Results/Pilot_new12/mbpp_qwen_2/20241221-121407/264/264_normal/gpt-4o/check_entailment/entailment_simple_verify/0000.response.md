Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The provided assertions for 90, 60, and 120 degrees are correct, as they correspond to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\frac{\pi}{3}\), and \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) radians respectively. The annotated version confirms that the function takes a degree value and returns the equivalent radian value by multiplying it with \(\frac{\pi}{180}\). Since the function passes the provided tests and the annotations align with the intended functionality, the program is correct.
