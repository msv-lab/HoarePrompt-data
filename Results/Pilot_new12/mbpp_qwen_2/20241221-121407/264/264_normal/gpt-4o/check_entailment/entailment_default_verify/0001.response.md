Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The assertions given in the code verify that the function works correctly for the specified angles. The output hints confirm that the function handles the conversion for float or integer inputs without any edge cases mentioned. Since the function follows the correct formula and the provided tests cover typical use cases, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
