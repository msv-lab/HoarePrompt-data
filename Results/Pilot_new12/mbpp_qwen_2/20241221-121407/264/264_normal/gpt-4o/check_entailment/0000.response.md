Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function `func_1` passes the given assertions for 90, 60, and 120 degrees, which correspond to \(\frac{\pi}{2}\), \(\frac{\pi}{3}\), and \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\) radians respectively. Since the mathematical conversion is accurate and the function works as expected for the provided test cases, and no other edge cases were found that would make the function incorrect, the program is correct.
