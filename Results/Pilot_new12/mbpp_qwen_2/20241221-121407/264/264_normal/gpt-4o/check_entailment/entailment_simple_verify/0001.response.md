Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \(degrees \times (\pi / 180)\). The provided assertions verify the function with known values, and the annotations support that the function handles valid inputs appropriately. Since the problem description asks to write a function to convert degrees to radians, and the provided code accomplishes this task correctly, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is valid.
