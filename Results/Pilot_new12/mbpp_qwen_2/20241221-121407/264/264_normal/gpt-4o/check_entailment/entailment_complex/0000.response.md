Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `degrees`, which is expected to be a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees. The function then converts this angle to radians by multiplying it by \(\pi / 180\) and returns the result. The annotations and the function itself clearly state this behavior. The test assertions also confirm that the function correctly converts the given degrees to radians. Since the problem description does not specify any edge cases or additional requirements, and the provided function adheres to the given specifications, the program is correct.
