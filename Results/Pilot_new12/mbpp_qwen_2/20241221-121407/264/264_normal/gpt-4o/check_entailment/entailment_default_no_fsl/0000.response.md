Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input by `Ï€/180`. The assertions in the code verify that the function works as expected for the given test cases (90 degrees, 60 degrees, and 120 degrees). Since the problem description is to write a function that converts degrees to radians, and the function does exactly that, it is correct for every potential case within the scope of the problem description. There are no edge cases or additional requirements mentioned that the code needs to handle beyond the basic conversion, so the function meets the requirements.
