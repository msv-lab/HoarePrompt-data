Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The annotated version confirms that the function accepts a parameter `degrees`, which is a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees, and returns the corresponding angle in radians. The provided assertions validate the function with specific test cases (90, 60, and 120 degrees), and the function passes these tests accurately. Since there are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that require special handling, and the function works as intended for the given inputs, the program is correct according to the problem description.
