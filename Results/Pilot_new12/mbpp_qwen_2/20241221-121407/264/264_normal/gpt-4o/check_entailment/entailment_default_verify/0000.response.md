Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The provided output hints confirm that the function simply accepts a float or integer representing an angle in degrees and returns the equivalent angle in radians. The assertions given in the program validate the function for specific cases (90, 60, and 120 degrees), which correspond to known values in radians. Since there are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that require special handling and the provided test cases confirm the correctness, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
