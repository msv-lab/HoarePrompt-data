Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input `degrees` by \(\pi\) divided by 180, which is the standard conversion formula. The provided test cases assert that the function returns the expected values for 90, 60, and 120 degrees, which are 1.5707963267948966, 1.0471975511965976, and 2.0943951023931953 radians, respectively. Since the function performs the required conversion accurately and the test cases validate this, the program meets the problem description in all cases.
