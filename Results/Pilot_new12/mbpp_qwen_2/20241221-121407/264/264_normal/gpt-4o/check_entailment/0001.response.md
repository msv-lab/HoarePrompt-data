Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input degrees by \(\pi / 180\). The assertions given in the code also correctly test the function with known values:

- \(90\) degrees is expected to be \(1.5707963267948966\) radians.
- \(60\) degrees is expected to be \(1.0471975511965976\) radians.
- \(120\) degrees is expected to be \(2.0943951023931953\) radians.

These conversions are accurate and the function appears to handle these cases correctly. Since the function follows the conversion formula accurately and the provided tests cover common angles, we can conclude that the function works correctly for the described task. There are no obvious edge cases or errors in the provided code.
