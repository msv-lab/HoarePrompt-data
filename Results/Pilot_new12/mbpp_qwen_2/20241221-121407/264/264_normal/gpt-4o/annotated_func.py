#State of the program right berfore the function call: degrees is a float or an integer representing the angle in degrees.
def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)
    #The program returns degrees multiplied by pi divided by 180, where degrees is a float or an integer representing the angle in degrees
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `degrees`, which is a float or an integer representing an angle in degrees. It converts this angle to radians by multiplying it by Ï€/180 and returns the result. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function simply performs the conversion without any additional actions.
