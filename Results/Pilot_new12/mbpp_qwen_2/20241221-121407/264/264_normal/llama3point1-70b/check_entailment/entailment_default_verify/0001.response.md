Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` accurately implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The provided output hints further confirm that the function handles valid input (float or integer representing degrees) and transforms it correctly into its radian equivalent. Since the problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians, and the provided code meets this requirement without any apparent issues or missing functionalities, the original assessment is accurate.
