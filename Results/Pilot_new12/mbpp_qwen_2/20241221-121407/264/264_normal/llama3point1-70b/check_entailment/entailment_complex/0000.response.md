Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program meets the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `deg`, which is expected to be either a float or an integer representing degrees. The function then converts this degree value into radians by multiplying it by `math.pi` and dividing the result by 180. This conversion formula is correct and aligns with the standard mathematical definition of converting degrees to radians. Since the program correctly implements this formula without any additional edge cases or missing functionalities, it satisfies the problem description for all valid inputs.
