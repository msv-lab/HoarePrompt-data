Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input degree value by Ï€ and then dividing the result by 180. This formula is mathematically sound and handles all potential cases for valid inputs (floats or integers). Since the problem description only requires converting degrees to radians and there are no specific edge cases mentioned, the given implementation meets the requirements for all valid inputs.
