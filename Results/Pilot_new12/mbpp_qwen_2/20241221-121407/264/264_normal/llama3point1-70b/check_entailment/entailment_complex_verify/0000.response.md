Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\pi \times \text{degrees}}{180} \). The annotated version confirms that the function takes a float or integer representing degrees and returns the equivalent value in radians. Since the input is assumed to be valid, there are no edge cases or missing functionalities that would make the program incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
