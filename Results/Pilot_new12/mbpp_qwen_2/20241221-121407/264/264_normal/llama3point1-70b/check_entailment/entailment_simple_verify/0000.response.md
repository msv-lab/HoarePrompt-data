Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program accurately implements the conversion of degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\pi \times \text{degrees}}{180} \). The annotated version confirms that the function takes a single argument `deg`, which is expected to be a float or an integer representing degrees, and returns the corresponding radian value. The annotation also supports the correctness by stating that the program returns `deg` multiplied by `math.pi` divided by 180, which aligns with the intended functionality. Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
