Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\pi \times \text{degrees}}{180} \). This formula is accurate and the implementation uses the `math.pi` constant from the Python standard library, which ensures the value of \(\pi\) is precise. There are no apparent edge cases or errors in the logic. The program will work correctly for any input degree value, as long as the input is a valid number.
