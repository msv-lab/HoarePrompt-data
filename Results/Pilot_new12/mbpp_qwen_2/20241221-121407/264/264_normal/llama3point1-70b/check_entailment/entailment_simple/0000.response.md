Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians as per the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single argument `deg`, which can be a float or an integer representing degrees. It then returns the value of `deg` converted to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This matches the requirement specified in the problem description to write a function to convert degrees to radians. Therefore, the program is correct.
