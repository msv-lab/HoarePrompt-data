Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\pi \times \text{degrees}}{180} \). The implementation uses the `math.pi` constant from the Python standard library, ensuring the value of \(\pi\) is precise. The output hints confirm that the function handles a float or integer input and returns the equivalent value in radians, without mentioning any edge cases or missing functionalities. Since the problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians, and the provided code fulfills this requirement accurately, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains valid.
