Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function imports the necessary `math` module and uses `math.pi`, which is accurate. The annotations describe the state of the program before the function call and the action taken within the function, supporting the correctness of the function for all valid input types (float or integer representing degrees). Since the problem description is to write a function to convert degrees to radians, and the provided function meets this requirement accurately, the original assessment is correct.
