Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The annotated version of the code confirms that the function accepts a float or integer representing degrees and returns the equivalent value in radians. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code, and the function behaves as expected based on the problem description. The annotations support the correctness of the function, and there is no evidence from the annotated version or the original assessment that suggests the function is incorrect.
