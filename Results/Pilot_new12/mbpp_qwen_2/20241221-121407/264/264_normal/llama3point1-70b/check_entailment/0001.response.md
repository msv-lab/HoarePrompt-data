Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula is accurate and the function implements it correctly by importing the `math` module and using `math.pi`. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for converting degrees to radians in all potential cases.
