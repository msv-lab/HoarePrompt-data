#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a float or an integer representing degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns deg multiplied by math.pi divided by 180
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `deg`, which is a float or an integer representing degrees, and returns the equivalent value in radians. Specifically, it multiplies the input degree value by Ï€ (pi) and then divides the result by 180. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities noted in the provided code. After the function concludes, the program state will have the original input `deg` transformed into its radian equivalent.
