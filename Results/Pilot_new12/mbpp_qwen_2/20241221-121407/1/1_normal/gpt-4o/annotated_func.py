#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))
    #`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `common_elements` is the set of elements common to both `list1` and `list2`, the program returns a sorted tuple of these common elements
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both lists. It computes the intersection of these two lists to find elements that are common to both. It then converts this set of common elements into a sorted tuple and returns it. Potential edge cases include lists containing duplicate elements, where only one instance of each common element is included in the result. If either `list1` or `list2` is empty, the resulting tuple will also be empty. If both lists are empty, the returned tuple will be empty as well.
