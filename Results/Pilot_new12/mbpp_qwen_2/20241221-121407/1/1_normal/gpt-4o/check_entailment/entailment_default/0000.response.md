Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns a tuple containing the common elements found in both lists. The code uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists and then sorts the result before returning it as a tuple. The examples given in the output hints and the assertions in the provided code cover various scenarios including lists with duplicates, lists with different elements, and even lists with no common elements. The function handles all these cases correctly without any issues. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
