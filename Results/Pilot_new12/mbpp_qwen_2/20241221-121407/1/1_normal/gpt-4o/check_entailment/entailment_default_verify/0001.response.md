Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The function uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists and then converts the result back into a tuple, ensuring that duplicates are removed and the elements are sorted. The test cases provided in the output hints and the original assessment confirm that the function works as expected for various scenarios, including handling duplicates and empty lists. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is valid.
