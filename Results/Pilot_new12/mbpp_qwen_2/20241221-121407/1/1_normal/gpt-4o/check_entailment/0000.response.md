Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The function uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists, which is an efficient approach. The resulting set is then converted to a sorted tuple before being returned. This method ensures that all shared elements are found and returned in ascending order, which aligns with the problem description. Based on the provided test cases, the function works correctly for the given inputs. Since no counterexamples were found where the function fails, the program is considered correct.
