Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The problem description states that the function should find the shared elements from the given two lists. The function `func_1` correctly identifies common elements between `list1` and `list2`.

2. **Use of Sets**: The function uses sets (`set(list1)` and `set(list2)`) to find common elements. This is an efficient way to determine intersections between two lists because set operations are optimized for such tasks.

3. **Returning Sorted Tuple**: The function converts the resulting set of common elements into a sorted tuple using `tuple(sorted(common_elements))`. This ensures that the output is consistent and sorted as expected.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases assert that the function works correctly for different inputs, which further confirms its correctness.

Given these points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
