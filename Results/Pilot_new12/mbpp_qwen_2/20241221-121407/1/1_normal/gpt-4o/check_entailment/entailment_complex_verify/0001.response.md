Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the shared elements between two lists and return them as a sorted tuple. The annotations correctly describe the behavior of the function and align with the actual implementation. The function uses sets to efficiently find common elements, handles duplicates by nature of sets, and ensures the result is sorted before returning. The provided test cases validate the function against different scenarios, including lists with duplicates and empty lists. Given the annotations and the problem description, there is no indication of any incorrect behavior or edge cases that would render the function incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
