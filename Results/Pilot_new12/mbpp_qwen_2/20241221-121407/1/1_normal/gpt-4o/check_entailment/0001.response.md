Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The function uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists and then converts the result back into a tuple. Given the test cases provided:

1. `func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10))` returns `(4, 5)`
2. `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7))` returns `(3, 4)`
3. `func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13))` returns `(13, 14)`

The function works as expected for these cases. Additionally, the function handles duplicates correctly by using sets, which automatically remove duplicates. It also sorts the resulting tuple, ensuring the elements are returned in ascending order. Since no potential edge cases or inputs were found that would make the program incorrect, the function appears to be correct for all provided and implied cases.
