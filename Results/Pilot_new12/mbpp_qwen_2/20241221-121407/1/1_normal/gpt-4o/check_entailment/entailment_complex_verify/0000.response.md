Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The annotations confirm that the function processes the inputs as lists, finds the intersection using sets, and returns the result as a sorted tuple. The provided test cases validate the function's behavior for different inputs, including lists with duplicates, where only one instance of each common element is included, and lists with no common elements, which results in an empty tuple. The function handles all potential edge cases as described in the annotations. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
