Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) as input, finds the common elements between them using set operations, and returns a sorted tuple of these common elements. This precisely matches the problem description which asks to find the shared elements from the given two lists. 

The program handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description:
- It correctly includes only one instance of each common element, as sets inherently do not allow duplicates.
- It returns an empty tuple if there are no common elements or if either of the input lists is empty.
- The use of `sorted` ensures that the elements in the returned tuple are in ascending order, fulfilling the requirement of returning a sorted tuple.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.
