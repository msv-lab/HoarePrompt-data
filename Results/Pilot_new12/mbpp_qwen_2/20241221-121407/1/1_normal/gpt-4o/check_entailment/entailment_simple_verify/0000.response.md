Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The annotations confirm that the function takes two lists as input, converts them into sets to find the intersection, and then returns the result as a sorted tuple. The provided test cases validate that the function works correctly for the given inputs. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
