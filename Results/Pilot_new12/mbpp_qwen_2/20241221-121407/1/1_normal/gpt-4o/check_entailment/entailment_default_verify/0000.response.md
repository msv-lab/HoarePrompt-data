Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The use of sets to find the intersection ensures that only unique common elements are returned, and the results are sorted, which aligns with the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, including handling duplicates and edge cases like empty lists. Since the function passes the provided assertions and the behavior matches the requirements, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
