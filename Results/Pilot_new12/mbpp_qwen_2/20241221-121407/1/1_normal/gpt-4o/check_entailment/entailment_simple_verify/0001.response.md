Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The annotations support this by showing that the function first converts the input lists into sets to find the intersection and then returns the result as a sorted tuple. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. Since no potential edge cases or inputs were found that would make the program incorrect under the assumption of valid inputs, the function appears to be correct.
