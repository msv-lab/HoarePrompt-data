The code creates a set of common elements between `list1` and `list2`. The set operation `&` finds the intersection of the two sets, which means it contains all the elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`.

The states of `list1` and `list2` are not affected by this operation. However, the new variable `common_elements` is created and it holds the intersection of the two sets.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `common_elements` is the set of elements common to both `list1` and `list2`.**
