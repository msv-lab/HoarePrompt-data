The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists. The function calculates the set of common elements between `list1` and `list2`, sorts this set, and then returns a sorted tuple of these common elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, returns a sorted tuple of elements that are common to both `list1` and `list2`.**
