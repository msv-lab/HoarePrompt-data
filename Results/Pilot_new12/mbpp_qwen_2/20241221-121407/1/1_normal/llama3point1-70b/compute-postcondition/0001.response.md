The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing elements that are present in both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and return a tuple containing elements that are common to both input tuples.
