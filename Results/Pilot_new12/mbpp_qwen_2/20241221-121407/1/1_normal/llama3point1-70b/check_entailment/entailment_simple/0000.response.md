Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) as inputs and returns a tuple containing elements that are present in both input tuples. This is achieved by converting each tuple to a set, finding the intersection of these sets using the `&` operator, and then converting the resulting set back to a tuple. 

Since the problem description asks for finding shared elements from two lists (which are represented as tuples in this context), and the program correctly implements this functionality, the program is correct.
