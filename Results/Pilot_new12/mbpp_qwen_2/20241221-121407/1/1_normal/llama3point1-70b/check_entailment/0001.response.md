Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) and returns their intersection as a tuple. This satisfies the problem description of finding shared elements between two lists (tuples in this case). The function uses sets to efficiently compute the intersection, which is a valid approach. Since the function works correctly for any input tuples containing any type of hashable elements (e.g., integers, strings), and the problem description does not specify any constraints beyond finding shared elements, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases.
