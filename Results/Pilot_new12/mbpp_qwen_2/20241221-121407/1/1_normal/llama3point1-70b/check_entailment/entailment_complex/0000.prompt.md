You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing elements that are present in both test_tup1 and test_tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. It converts these tuples into sets to find the intersection, which consists of elements present in both tuples. The function then converts this intersection back into a tuple and returns it. This means the returned tuple contains only the unique elements that are present in both input tuples. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If either of the input tuples is empty, the returned tuple will also be empty.
- If there are no common elements between the two tuples, the returned tuple will be empty.
- If the input tuples contain duplicate elements, these duplicates will be removed in the resulting tuple due to the conversion to sets.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
