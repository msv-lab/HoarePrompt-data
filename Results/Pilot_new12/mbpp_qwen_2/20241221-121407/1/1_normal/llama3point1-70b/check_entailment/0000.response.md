Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) and returns a tuple containing the intersection of the two input tuples. This meets the requirement of finding shared elements from the given two lists. The function uses sets to efficiently compute the intersection, which is a correct approach. Since the function works correctly for all potential cases (i.e., it returns the correct shared elements for any two input tuples), the program is correct.
