Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements from the given two tuples by converting them into sets, finding their intersection, and then converting the result back into a tuple. This approach handles all the mentioned edge cases:

- If either of the input tuples is empty, the returned tuple will also be empty because the intersection of any set with an empty set is empty.
- If there are no common elements between the two tuples, the returned tuple will be empty.
- If the input tuples contain duplicate elements, these duplicates will be removed in the resulting tuple due to the conversion to sets.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases described, the correctness of the program is True.
