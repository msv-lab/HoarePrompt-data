Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two tuples by converting them into sets and finding their intersection. The function then returns this intersection as a tuple, which contains only the unique elements present in both input tuples. Given the problem description, the function meets all the requirements for every potential case:

- If either of the input tuples is empty, the returned tuple will also be empty, as expected.
- If there are no common elements between the two tuples, the returned tuple will be empty.
- If the input tuples contain duplicate elements, these duplicates will be removed in the resulting tuple due to the conversion to sets, ensuring the output contains only unique shared elements.

Since the function behaves as intended for all described cases, the program is correct.
