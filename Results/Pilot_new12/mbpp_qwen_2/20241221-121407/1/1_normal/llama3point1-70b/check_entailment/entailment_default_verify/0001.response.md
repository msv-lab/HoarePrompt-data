Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by finding the shared elements between two tuples and returning them as a tuple. The use of sets ensures efficient computation of the intersection and removes any duplicates, which aligns with the problem requirements. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for various scenarios, including empty tuples and tuples without common elements. Given that the problem description does not impose additional constraints and the function handles all provided edge cases correctly, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
