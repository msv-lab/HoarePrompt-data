Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) as inputs. It then converts these tuples into sets to find their intersection, which results in a set containing elements that are present in both input tuples. Finally, it converts this intersection back into a tuple before returning it. This process ensures that the returned tuple contains only the unique elements that are present in both input tuples, as required by the problem description.

The program handles the following scenarios correctly:
- If either of the input tuples is empty, the intersection will be empty, resulting in an empty tuple being returned.
- If there are no common elements between the two tuples, the intersection will be empty, resulting in an empty tuple being returned.
- Duplicate elements within the same tuple are removed due to the conversion to sets, ensuring that the final result contains only unique shared elements.

Since the program accurately performs the task of finding shared elements from two tuples as specified in the problem description, it is correct.
