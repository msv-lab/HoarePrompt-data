Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements from the given two tuples and returns them as a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function converts the tuples to sets to find the intersection, which removes duplicates and only includes common elements. The function handles various edge cases such as empty tuples and tuples with no common elements appropriately. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
