Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) and returns a tuple containing the intersection of the two input tuples. This directly aligns with the problem description of finding shared elements from the given two lists (note that tuples can be treated as lists in this context). The use of sets to compute the intersection is a correct and efficient approach. The annotated version further confirms that the function returns a tuple containing elements present in both input tuples, which supports the correctness of the original assessment.
