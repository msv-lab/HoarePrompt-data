Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements between two tuples and returns them as a tuple. The annotations further confirm this by stating that the function converts the tuples to sets to find the intersection and then returns the result as a tuple. The annotations also cover potential edge cases such as empty tuples and no common elements, which are handled correctly. Since the problem description only requires finding shared elements, and the function meets this requirement without any specified constraints, the original assessment is correct.
