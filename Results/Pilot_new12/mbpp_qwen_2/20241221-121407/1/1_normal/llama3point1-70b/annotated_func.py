#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing elements that are present in both test_tup1 and test_tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two tuples, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. It converts these tuples into sets to find the intersection, which consists of elements present in both tuples. The function then converts this intersection back into a tuple and returns it. This means the returned tuple contains only the unique elements that are present in both input tuples. 

Potential edge cases include:
- If either of the input tuples is empty, the returned tuple will also be empty.
- If there are no common elements between the two tuples, the returned tuple will be empty.
- If the input tuples contain duplicate elements, these duplicates will be removed in the resulting tuple due to the conversion to sets.
