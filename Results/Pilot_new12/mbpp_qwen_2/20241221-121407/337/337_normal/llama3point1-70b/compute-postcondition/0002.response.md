Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. It achieves this by iterating over each integer `i` in the list and including it in the sum only if it appears exactly once in the list. If an integer appears more than once, it is not included in the sum. The function handles the case where the list might be empty, returning 0 in such a scenario.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list is empty, the function returns 0.
- If all integers in the list are duplicates, the function returns 0.
- If the list contains only unique integers, the function returns the sum of those integers.

**Missing Functionality (if any):**
- The current implementation correctly handles the logic for summing unique integers. There are no obvious missing functionalities based on the provided code and annotations.
