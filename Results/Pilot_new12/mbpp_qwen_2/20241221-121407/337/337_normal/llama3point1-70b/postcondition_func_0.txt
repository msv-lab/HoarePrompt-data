The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. It achieves this by iterating over each integer `i` in the list and including it in the sum only if it appears exactly once in the list. If an integer appears more than once, it is not included in the sum. The function handles the case where the list might be empty, returning 0 in such a scenario.
