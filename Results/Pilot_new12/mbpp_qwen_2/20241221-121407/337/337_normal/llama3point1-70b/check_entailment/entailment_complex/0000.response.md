Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`lst`) and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. It achieves this by using a generator expression within the `sum()` function to iterate over each integer `i` in the list `lst`. The condition `if lst.count(i) == 1` ensures that only integers appearing exactly once in the list are included in the sum. If the list is empty, the function correctly returns 0, as there are no elements to sum. This implementation adheres to the problem description and handles the expected cases.
