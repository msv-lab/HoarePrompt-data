Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided function `func_1` meets the problem description of finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The annotated version further clarifies that the program iterates through the list and sums up elements that appear exactly once, which aligns with the problem requirements. The function is correct under the assumption that the input is a valid list of integers, as stated in the annotations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program remains correct.
