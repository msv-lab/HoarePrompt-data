Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of all unique (non-repeated) elements in the list. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Input**: The function accepts a list (`lst`) as input, which aligns with the problem description requiring a list of integers.
2. **Sum Calculation**: The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`. It checks if the count of `i` in the list is exactly one using `lst.count(i) == 1`. This ensures that only non-repeated elements are considered.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns the sum of these non-repeated elements, which fulfills the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list.

Since the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement, it is correct.
