Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The annotation clearly states that the function iterates over each integer in the list and includes it in the sum only if it appears exactly once. This matches the problem description accurately. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
