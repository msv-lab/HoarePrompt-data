Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list of integers. The annotated version further clarifies that the function iterates over each integer in the list and includes it in the sum only if it appears exactly once, which aligns with the problem description. The function also handles the case where the list might be empty, returning 0 in such a scenario. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
