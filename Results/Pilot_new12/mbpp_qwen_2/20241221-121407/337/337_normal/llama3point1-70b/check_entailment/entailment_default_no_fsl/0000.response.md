Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to iterate over each element in the list and include it in the sum only if it appears exactly once using the condition `lst.count(i) == 1`. The code handles the case where the list might be empty by returning 0, which aligns with the problem description and the output hints. There are no apparent cases where the code fails to meet the requirements based on the given information.
