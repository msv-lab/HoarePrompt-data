Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The output hints confirm that the function iterates over each integer in the list and includes it in the sum only if it appears exactly once. If an integer appears more than once, it is excluded from the sum. The function also handles the case where the list might be empty, returning 0 in such a scenario. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
