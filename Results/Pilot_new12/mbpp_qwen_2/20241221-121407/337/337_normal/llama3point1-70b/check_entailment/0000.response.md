Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. For any given list, the function uses a generator expression to filter out elements that appear more than once using `lst.count(i) == 1`. It then sums these unique elements. This logic satisfies the requirement of finding the sum of non-repeated elements without any edge cases or inputs that would cause it to fail.
