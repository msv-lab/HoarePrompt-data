Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each integer in the list and includes it in the sum only if it appears exactly once, which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the function handles the case where the list might be empty by returning 0, as mentioned in the output hints. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
