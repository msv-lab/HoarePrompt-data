Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly processes a list of integers and returns the sum of all unique integers within that list. The generator expression `(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)` filters out repeated elements, and the `sum` function adds up the remaining unique elements. The annotations match the described behavior, and there are no discrepancies between the provided code and the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
