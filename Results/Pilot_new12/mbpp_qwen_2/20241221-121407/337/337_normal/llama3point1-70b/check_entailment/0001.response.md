Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to iterate through the list and includes only those elements that appear exactly once (using `lst.count(i) == 1`). Since the problem description does not specify any constraints or additional conditions and the provided function handles all potential cases as expected, the function is correct.
