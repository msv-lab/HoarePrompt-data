Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst` and includes it in the sum only if it appears exactly once in the list using `lst.count(i) == 1`. The function also handles the case where the list might be empty by returning 0, as confirmed by the output hints. Since the code meets the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is **True**.
