#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of all unique integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. It achieves this by iterating over each integer `i` in the list and including it in the sum only if it appears exactly once in the list. If an integer appears more than once, it is not included in the sum. The function handles the case where the list might be empty, returning 0 in such a scenario.
