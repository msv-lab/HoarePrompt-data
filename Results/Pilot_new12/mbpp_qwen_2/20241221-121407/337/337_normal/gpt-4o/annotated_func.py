#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))
    #The program returns the sum of unique integers from the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of the unique integers present in the list. It achieves this by converting the list into a set to remove duplicates and then calculating the sum of the elements in the set. Potential edge cases include handling empty lists or lists containing only identical elements. The function does not modify the original list `lst`.
