Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of the unique integers present in the list. It achieves this by converting the list into a set to remove duplicates and then calculating the sum of the elements in the set. Potential edge cases include handling empty lists or lists containing only identical elements. The function does not modify the original list `lst`.**
