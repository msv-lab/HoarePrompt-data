Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`lst`) as input, removes duplicate elements using the `set` data structure, and then calculates the sum of these unique elements using the `sum` function. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given inputs, returning the sum of non-repeated elements. Since the function adheres to the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
