Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the non-repeated (unique) elements in the list. This is achieved by converting the list to a set (which removes duplicates) and then using the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the unique elements. The provided test cases verify that the function works as expected for different inputs, confirming its correctness in fulfilling the problem description.
