Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list by utilizing the properties of sets to eliminate duplicates and then summing the remaining unique elements. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a list of integers and returning the sum of unique integers. The examples given in the problem description and the provided assertions also validate the correctness of the function. There are no indications from the output hints or the provided code that suggest any issues with the program's functionality under the given constraints.
