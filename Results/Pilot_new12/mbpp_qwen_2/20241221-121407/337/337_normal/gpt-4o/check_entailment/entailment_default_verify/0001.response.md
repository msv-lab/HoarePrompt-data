Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the given code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The use of a set to eliminate duplicates and then summing the elements is a valid and efficient approach. The provided output hints also align with the functionality of the code, confirming that the function handles the expected behavior and potential edge cases such as empty lists or lists with identical elements. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the original assessment.
