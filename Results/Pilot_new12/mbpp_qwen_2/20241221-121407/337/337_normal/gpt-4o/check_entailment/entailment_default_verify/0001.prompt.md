You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicate elements from the input list and then calculates the sum of the unique elements using the `sum` function. This approach correctly finds the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list.

Given the problem description to find the sum of non-repeated elements, the function `func_1` adheres to this requirement. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` returns `21`, which is the sum of unique elements `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
2. `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])` returns `71`, which is the sum of unique elements `[1, 9, 4, 2, 45]`.
3. `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])` returns `78`, which is the sum of unique elements `[12, 9, 45, 2]`.

Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the logic seems sound for finding the sum of non-repeated elements, we can conclude that the program is correct. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of the unique integers present in the list. It achieves this by converting the list into a set to remove duplicates and then calculating the sum of the elements in the set. Potential edge cases include handling empty lists or lists containing only identical elements. The function does not modify the original list `lst`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
