Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list by using a set to eliminate duplicates and then summing the resulting set. The annotated version clearly describes the function's behavior and confirms that it adheres to the problem description. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
