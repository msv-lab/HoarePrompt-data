Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` uses the `sum` function combined with the `set` data structure to calculate the sum of unique elements in the given list. This approach works because converting the list to a set removes all duplicate elements, and then summing the resulting set gives the sum of non-repeated elements.

Given the examples:
1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6])` returns `21`, which is the sum of unique elements `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`.
2. `func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4])` returns `71`, which is the sum of unique elements `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 45, 4]`.
3. `func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10])` returns `78`, which is the sum of unique elements `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2]`.

The program handles the provided test cases correctly. Additionally, since the operation of summing a set of unique elements is mathematically sound and the implementation is straightforward, it is unlikely to fail in other cases as well. Therefore, the program is correct.
