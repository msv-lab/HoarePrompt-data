Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the sum of the non-repeated (unique) elements in the list. This is achieved by converting the list into a set using `set(lst)`, which automatically removes all duplicate elements. Then, the `sum` function calculates the sum of the elements in the resulting set.

The program handles the following scenarios correctly:
1. When there are no repeated elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 3]`).
2. When there are repeated elements (e.g., `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]`).
3. When the list contains both unique and repeated elements (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`).

The provided assertions also validate these cases:
- The first assertion checks a list with multiple repeated elements and non-repeated elements.
- The second assertion checks a list with a mix of repeated and non-repeated elements.
- The third assertion checks a list with repeated elements.

Since the function correctly sums the unique elements in each of these cases, and the problem description only requires that the function works for valid inputs (as per the assumption), the program is correct.
