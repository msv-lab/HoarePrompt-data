Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list. The annotations further clarify that the function converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and then calculates the sum of the unique elements. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains valid.
