Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `lst`, converts it to a set to remove duplicate elements, and then calculates the sum of the unique elements using the `sum` function. This approach ensures that only non-repeated elements are summed up. The test cases given in the output hints confirm that the function works correctly for various scenarios, including lists with repeated elements, empty lists, and lists with a single unique element. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
