Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided code correctly implements the functionality to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`lst`) as input and returns the sum of unique elements in the list. The examples provided in the assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct sums for lists with repeated and unique elements. The original assessment is supported by the annotated version and the test cases, indicating that the program meets the problem description and is correct.
