Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list by first converting the list to a set (which removes duplicates) and then summing the elements. The assertions provided in the problem description cover various cases including lists with repeated elements and different numerical values. There are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to fail under the given assumptions about valid inputs. Therefore, the function appears to meet the requirements for all described cases.
