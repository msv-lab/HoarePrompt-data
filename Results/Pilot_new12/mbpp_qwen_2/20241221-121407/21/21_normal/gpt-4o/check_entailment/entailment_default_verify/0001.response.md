Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program is correct based on the provided problem description and the code. The function `func_1` uses the `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list, which aligns with the problem description. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the minimum value from the list and raising a `ValueError` for an empty list. There are no indications in the problem description or the output hints that suggest the program is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
