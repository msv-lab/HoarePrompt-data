Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list. This approach is correct and works for all possible lists of numbers. The provided test cases cover different scenarios (positive numbers, increasing order, and a mix of numbers) and the function passes all these tests. Since the function correctly identifies the smallest number in each case and there are no obvious edge cases that the current implementation fails to handle, the program is correct.
