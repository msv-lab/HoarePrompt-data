Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It accepts a list of integers and returns the smallest number in that list using the built-in `min()` function. The function does not modify the original list, adheres to the expected behavior, and the provided test cases confirm its correctness for various scenarios (non-empty lists with different values). Since the problem description only requires finding the smallest number in a list and the function meets this requirement accurately under the given assumptions, the program is correct.
