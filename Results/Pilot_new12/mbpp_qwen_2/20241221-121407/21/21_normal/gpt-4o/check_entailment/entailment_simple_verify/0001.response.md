Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides clear insights into the state of the program at different points. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) as input and returns the minimum value using the built-in `min()` function. The provided test cases cover various scenarios (positive numbers, small lists, and a list with a higher initial number). Since the function correctly identifies the smallest number in each case and the annotations confirm that the function operates as expected, the program is correct according to the problem description.
