Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list. The annotated version further clarifies that the function accepts a list of integers, returns the minimum value, and does not modify the original list. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and the function passes all these tests. There are no issues with edge cases or invalid inputs as per the given assumptions. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.
