Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min` function. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for different inputs, including a list with a negative number, a list with multiple elements, and a list with a single element. Since the problem description does not specify additional requirements such as handling invalid inputs (e.g., non-list inputs or lists containing non-integer values), and the program meets the core requirement of finding the smallest number in a list of integers, the program is correct.
