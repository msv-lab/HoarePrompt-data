Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list. This approach is correct and works for all valid input lists. The function handles the problem description well and produces the correct output for the given test cases. There is no indication in the problem description or the output hints that the function would fail for any potential case under the assumption of valid input.
