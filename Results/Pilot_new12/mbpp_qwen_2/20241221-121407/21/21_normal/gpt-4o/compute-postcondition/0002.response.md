Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the minimum value from the list. If the list is empty, the function raises a `ValueError`. The function does not modify the original list and ensures that the returned value is an integer.**

**Step-by-step reasoning:**
1. The function accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers.
2. The function returns the minimum value from the list `lst`.
3. If `lst` is empty, the function raises a `ValueError` because finding the minimum value of an empty list is undefined.
4. The function does not modify the original list `lst`.

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `lst` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle non-integer values in the list. If the list contains non-integer values, the function will still attempt to find the minimum, which may not be the intended behavior. However, the code itself does not explicitly handle this case, so it is assumed to be the responsibility of the caller to ensure the list contains only integers.
