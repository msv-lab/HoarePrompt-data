Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. This function will work correctly for any non-empty list of numbers. For an empty list, `min()` will raise a `ValueError`, but since the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, we assume the function should handle it as is, which is correct behavior for the given task. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases described.
