Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the smallest number in a list. It takes a list of integers as input and returns the minimum value using the built-in `min()` function. Since the problem description only requires the function to find the smallest number in a list of integers and does not specify additional constraints or edge cases (such as handling non-integer inputs or empty lists), the given implementation meets the problem description for all valid cases.
