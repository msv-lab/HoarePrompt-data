Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in the list `nums`. The annotated version confirms that `nums` is a list of integers and that the function returns the minimum value from the list. Although the annotation mentions that the function will raise a `ValueError` for an empty list, the problem description does not specify how to handle empty lists, and returning `None` or another default value could also be considered correct depending on the specific requirements. However, since the function does correctly identify the smallest number in a non-empty list, which aligns with the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
