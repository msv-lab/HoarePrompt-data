Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. The annotations confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the minimum value from the list. Although the annotations mention that raising a `ValueError` for an empty list is the expected behavior, this aligns with the typical usage of the `min()` function, which raises an error when applied to an empty iterable. Since the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, the current implementation is correct. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
