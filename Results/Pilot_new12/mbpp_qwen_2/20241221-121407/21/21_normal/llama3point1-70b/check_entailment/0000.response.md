Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in the list. This function works correctly for any list of numbers, including empty lists (returning `None`) and lists with duplicate minimum values. Since the program meets the requirement for finding the smallest number in a list for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
