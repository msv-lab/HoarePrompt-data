Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that `func_1` takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input and returns the minimum value using the built-in `min()` function. The function behaves as expected for a non-empty list of numbers. Although the problem description does not explicitly mention handling an empty list, returning a `ValueError` for an empty list is considered correct behavior for the given task, as the function's intent is to find the smallest number in a list. Thus, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
