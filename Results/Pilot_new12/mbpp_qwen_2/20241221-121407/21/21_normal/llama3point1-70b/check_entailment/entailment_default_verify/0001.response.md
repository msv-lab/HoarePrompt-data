Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. The function behaves as expected for a non-empty list of numbers. While the output hints indicate that the function will raise a `ValueError` for an empty list, this is the correct behavior as per the Python `min()` function's specifications. Since the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, the function's current behavior is appropriate. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness.
