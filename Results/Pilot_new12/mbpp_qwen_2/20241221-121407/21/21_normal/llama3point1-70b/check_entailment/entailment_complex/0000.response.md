Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` correctly implements the requirement to find the smallest number in a list. It uses the built-in `min()` function to return the minimum value from the list `nums`. The function adheres to the problem description by accepting a list of integers as input and returning the smallest integer in that list. Additionally, the function raises a `ValueError` if the list is empty, which is consistent with the problem description's expectation that the function should handle such cases. Since the problem description does not specify how to handle non-list inputs or inputs containing non-integer values, and we are assuming valid input as stated, the function meets all the necessary criteria.
