Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the smallest number in a list using the built-in `min()` function. The function raises a `ValueError` when the input list `nums` is empty, which aligns with the problem description. Since the problem description only requires handling a valid list of integers, and the function behaves correctly under these conditions, the program is correct.
