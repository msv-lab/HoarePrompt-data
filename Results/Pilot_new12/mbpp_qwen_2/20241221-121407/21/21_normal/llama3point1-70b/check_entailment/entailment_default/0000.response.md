Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list of integers as input and returns the smallest number using the built-in `min()` function. The function handles all potential cases, including an empty list, which would raise a `ValueError` due to the nature of the `min()` function. Since the problem description and the code align, and there are no specific cases mentioned in the hints that the code does not handle, the program is correct.
