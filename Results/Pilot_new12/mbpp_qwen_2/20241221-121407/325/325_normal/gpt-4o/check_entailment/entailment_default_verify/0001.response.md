Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. The provided output hints confirm that the function accepts an integer `month` within the range of 1 to 12 and returns `True` if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function only performs the necessary check without any additional actions, and it handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
