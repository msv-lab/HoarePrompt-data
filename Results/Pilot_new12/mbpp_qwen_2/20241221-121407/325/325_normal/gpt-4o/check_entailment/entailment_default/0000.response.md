Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code checks if the given month number contains 30 days by verifying if the month is in the set `{4, 6, 9, 11}`, which correctly identifies the months with 30 days. The function works as expected for the provided test cases and for every potential case within the range of 1 to 12. The function does not perform any unnecessary operations and only returns `True` or `False` based on the input. The output hints align with the code's functionality, and there are no additional cases where the code would fail to meet the problem description.
