Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether the given month number (ranging from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. It does this by using a set `months_with_30_days` containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which are the month numbers that have 30 days. The function returns `True` if the input `month` is in this set, and `False` otherwise.

The assertions provided in the annotated program verify that the function behaves as expected:
- `func_1(6)` returns `True` because June (month 6) has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` because February (month 2) does not have 30 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False` because December (month 12) does not have 30 days.

Since the function performs the required task accurately and the provided test cases confirm its correctness, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
