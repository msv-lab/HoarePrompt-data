Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies months with 30 days. According to the problem description, the function should return `True` for months that have 30 days and `False` for those that do not. The function uses a set to store the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11), which are the months with 30 days. It then checks if the given month is in this set. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness:

- `func_1(6)` returns `True`, which is correct because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False`, which is correct because February typically has 28 or 29 days, not 30.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because December has 31 days, not 30.

Since the function handles all tested cases correctly and the logic appears sound, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases within the given problem description.
