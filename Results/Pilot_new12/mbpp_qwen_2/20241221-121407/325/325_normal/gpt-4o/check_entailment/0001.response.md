Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. It uses a set to store the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days, and returns `True` if the given month is in this set, otherwise `False`. 

Given the problem description, we need to check all months from 1 to 12:

- Month 1 (January): 31 days
- Month 2 (February): 28 or 29 days
- Month 3 (March): 31 days
- Month 4 (April): 30 days
- Month 5 (May): 31 days
- Month 6 (June): 30 days
- Month 7 (July): 31 days
- Month 8 (August): 31 days
- Month 9 (September): 30 days
- Month 10 (October): 31 days
- Month 11 (November): 30 days
- Month 12 (December): 31 days

The function correctly returns `True` for months 4, 6, 9, and 11, and `False` for all other months. Since the function handles all potential cases correctly, the program is correct.
