Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description, the function `func_1` needs to determine whether a given month number contains 30 days. The provided code correctly implements this functionality by checking if the month is in the set `{4, 6, 9, 11}`, which are the months with 30 days. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` for months with 30 days and `False` for others. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
