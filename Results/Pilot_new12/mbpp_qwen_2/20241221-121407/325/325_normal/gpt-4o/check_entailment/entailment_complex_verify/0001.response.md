Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not by using a set to store the month numbers that have 30 days. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set, and `False` otherwise. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` for months 4, 6, 9, and 11, and `False` for all other months. Since the function handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description, the program is correct.
