Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. The months are given as numbers from 1 to 12.

2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1(month)` takes a single argument `month`, which is an integer between 1 and 12.
   - A set `months_with_30_days` is defined containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11. These are the month numbers that have 30 days.
   - The function returns `True` if `month` is in the set `months_with_30_days`, otherwise it returns `False`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - `assert func_1(6) == True`: Month 6 (June) has 30 days, so this assertion is correct.
   - `assert func_1(2) == False`: Month 2 (February) typically does not have 30 days, so this assertion is correct.
   - `assert func_1(12) == False`: Month 12 (December) does not have 30 days, so this assertion is correct.

The function correctly checks whether a given month has 30 days by comparing the input month against a predefined set of months with 30 days. It handles all the cases specified in the problem description without any additional conditions or assumptions. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
