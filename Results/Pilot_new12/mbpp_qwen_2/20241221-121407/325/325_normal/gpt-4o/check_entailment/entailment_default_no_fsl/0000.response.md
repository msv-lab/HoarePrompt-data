Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given month number contains 30 days. It uses a set `months_with_30_days` containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which are the month numbers that have 30 days. The function returns `True` if the input `month` is in this set and `False` otherwise. The assertions provided in the program cover all the cases for months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12), and February (2, which has 28 or 29 days). Since the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the provided examples, the program is correct.
