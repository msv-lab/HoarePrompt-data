Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not by using a set to store the month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days. The function returns `True` for these months and `False` for others. The provided test cases assert the correctness of the function for the specified months (4, 6, 9, 11 returning `True` and 2, 12 returning `False`). The annotations also correctly describe the behavior of the function. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
