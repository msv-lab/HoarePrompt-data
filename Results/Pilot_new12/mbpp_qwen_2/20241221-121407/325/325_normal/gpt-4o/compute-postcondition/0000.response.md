The code creates a set `months_with_30_days` containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11. These values represent the months with 30 days. The variable `month` is an integer between 1 and 12. The creation of the set does not affect the value of `month`, so the only information updated is the definition of `months_with_30_days`.

Output State: **`month` is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12; `months_with_30_days` is a set containing {4, 6, 9, 11}**
