Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program checks if a given month number is in the list of months with 30 days. However, it does not account for February (month number 2), which does not have 30 days. Additionally, months like April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11) are correctly identified, but this does not cover all months. For instance, if the input is 2 (February), the program will return `False`, which is incorrect according to the problem description since February does not have 30 days. Therefore, the program is incorrect because it fails to handle the case for February.
