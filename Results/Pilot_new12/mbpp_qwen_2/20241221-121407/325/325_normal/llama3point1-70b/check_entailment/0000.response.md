Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program correctly identifies months with 30 days for the given months (4, 6, 9, 11). However, it does not account for other months, including February, which has a variable number of days depending on whether the year is a leap year or not. Additionally, it does not handle months like January, March, May, July, August, October, and December, which have either 31 days or are not mentioned in the list and thus would incorrectly return `False`. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for all potential cases.
