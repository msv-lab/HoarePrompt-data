Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. According to the problem description, months are represented as integers from 1 to 12. The function defines a list `thirty_days_months` containing the numbers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which are the month numbers that have 30 days. The function then checks if the given `month` is in this list. If the month is one of these numbers, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This correctly identifies months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11) and all other months are correctly identified as having either 31 days or 28/29 days. Therefore, the program always follows the problem description for every potential valid input.
