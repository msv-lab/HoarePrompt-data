Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the function should check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. According to the annotations, the function `func_1` checks if the month is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, and November). However, this does not cover all months. The function does not handle February (month number 2), which does not have 30 days. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate as the function does not correctly identify all months with 30 days.
