Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code only checks if the month is one of the integers 4, 6, 9, or 11, which are months with 30 days according to the problem description. However, the problem description asks to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not, which means the function should return `True` for months 4, 6, 9, and 11, and `False` for other months including February (2) and July (7), which do not have 30 days. The code does not account for months that do not have 30 days, thus it is incorrect. For example, if the input is 2 (February), the function will return `False`, which is incorrect because February does not have 30 days.
