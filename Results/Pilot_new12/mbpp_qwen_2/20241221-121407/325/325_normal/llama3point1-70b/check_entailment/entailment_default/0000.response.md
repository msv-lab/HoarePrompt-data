Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. According to the problem description, months are represented by numbers from 1 to 12. The code correctly identifies the months with 30 days, which are 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), and 11 (November). For these months, the function returns `True`. For all other months, it returns `False`. 

The output hints confirm this behavior: the function `func_1` returns `True` if the `month` is one of the integers 4, 6, 9, or 11, and `False` otherwise. This matches the problem description exactly. Since the function handles all potential cases correctly based on the given problem description, the correctness is **True**.
