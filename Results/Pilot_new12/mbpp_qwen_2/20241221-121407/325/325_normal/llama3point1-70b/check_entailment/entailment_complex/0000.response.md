Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1` takes an integer `month` as input, and according to the problem description, `1 <= month <= 12`. The implementation correctly checks this range implicitly through the list of months with 30 days.

2. **Output Logic**: The function returns `True` if `month` is one of the integers 4, 6, 9, or 11 (representing April, June, September, and November), and `False` otherwise. This directly corresponds to the requirement of checking whether the given month has 30 days.

3. **Comprehensive Check**: The list `thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]` includes all months that have exactly 30 days, and the function correctly uses this list to perform the check.

4. **No Additional Actions**: The function does not perform any additional actions beyond the check, adhering to the problem statement.

5. **Valid Assumptions**: Given the problem assumes valid inputs, the function handles the specified cases accurately without needing to handle invalid input scenarios.

Since the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid month numbers, the program is correct.
