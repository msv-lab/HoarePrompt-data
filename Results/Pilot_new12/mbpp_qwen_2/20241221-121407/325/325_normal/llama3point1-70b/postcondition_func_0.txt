The function `func_1` accepts an integer `month` as a parameter, where `1 <= month <= 12`. It checks whether `month` is one of the integers 4, 6, 9, or 11, which represent months with 30 days. The function returns `True` if `month` is 4, 6, 9, or 11, and `False` otherwise. There are no additional actions performed beyond this check. The function does not modify any external variables and only returns a boolean value based on the input `month`.
