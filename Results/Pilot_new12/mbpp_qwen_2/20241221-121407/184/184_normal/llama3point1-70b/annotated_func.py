#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of odd integers from the original list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the original list `nums`. The function iterates through each integer in the input list and checks if it is odd (i.e., not divisible by 2). If the integer is odd, it is included in the returned list. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but the function correctly handles lists that may contain non-integer elements, which would result in a TypeError when attempting to determine if they are odd. The function does not handle such cases explicitly; thus, it may fail silently or raise an error if non-integer values are present in the input list.
