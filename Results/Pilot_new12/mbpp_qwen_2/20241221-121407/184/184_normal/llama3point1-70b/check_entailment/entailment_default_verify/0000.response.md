Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided program `func_1` appears to correctly filter out odd numbers from the input list based on the problem description, the output hints indicate that the program does not handle non-integer values gracefully. Specifically, if the input list contains non-integer elements, the program will raise a `TypeError` without any explicit handling. Since the problem description assumes valid input (i.e., a list of integers), the program should be designed to either exclude non-integer values from consideration or raise an appropriate error message. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness cannot be maintained without addressing this potential issue.
