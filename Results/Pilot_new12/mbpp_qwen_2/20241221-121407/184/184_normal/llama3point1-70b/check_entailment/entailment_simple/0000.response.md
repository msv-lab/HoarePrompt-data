Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]` iterates over each number in `nums` and includes it in the result list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). Since the program fulfills the requirement to filter odd numbers from the input list as specified in the problem description, it is correct.
