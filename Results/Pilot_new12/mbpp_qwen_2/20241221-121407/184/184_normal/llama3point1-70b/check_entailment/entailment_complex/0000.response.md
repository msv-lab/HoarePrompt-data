Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` correctly implements the requirement to filter out odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The list comprehension iterates through each number in `nums`, checks if it is odd using the condition `num % 2 != 0`, and includes it in the returned list if the condition is true. The function does not handle non-integer elements in the input list, which aligns with the assumption that valid input will be provided. Therefore, the function always meets the problem description.
