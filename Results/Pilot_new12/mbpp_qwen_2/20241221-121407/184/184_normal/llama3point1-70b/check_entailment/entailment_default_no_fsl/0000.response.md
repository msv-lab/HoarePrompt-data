Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The problem description asks for a function to filter odd numbers, and the function provided does exactly that. The output hints mention that the function does not handle non-integer elements explicitly, but since the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases, and assuming valid input as stated, the function meets the requirements for every potential case described.
