Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. The annotations confirm that the function iterates through each integer in the input list `nums` and includes it in the returned list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). Although the annotations mention that the function may fail silently or raise an error if non-integer values are present in the input list, the problem description does not specify handling of such cases. Since the task assumes valid input, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
