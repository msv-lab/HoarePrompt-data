Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The list comprehension iterates through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description of filtering odd numbers. There are no apparent edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the given problem description.
