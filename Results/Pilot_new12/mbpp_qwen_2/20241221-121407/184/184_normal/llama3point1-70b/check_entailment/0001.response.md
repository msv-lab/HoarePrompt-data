Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly filters out odd numbers from a list. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the output list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). This logic matches the problem description accurately for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
