Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program `func_1` filters out odd numbers from the input list `nums`. The annotated version supports this by stating that the program returns a list of odd integers from the original list `nums`. The logic `num % 2 != 0` ensures that only odd numbers are included in the returned list. Given the problem description and the provided annotated version, there is no evidence suggesting that the program is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
