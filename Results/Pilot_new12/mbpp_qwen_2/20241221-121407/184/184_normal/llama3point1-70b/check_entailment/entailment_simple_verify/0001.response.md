Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version further clarifies that the program iterates over each number in the input list `nums`, and includes only those numbers that are odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). This logic correctly filters out odd numbers from the list, which aligns perfectly with the problem description of writing a function to filter odd numbers. Therefore, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
