Final: **False**

Reasoning: While the provided program `func_1` appears to correctly filter out odd numbers based on the problem description, the annotated version highlights an important aspect that was not considered in the original assessment. The annotation mentions that the function does not handle non-integer values in the input list `nums`, which would result in a `TypeError`. Since the problem description specifies that the input should be a list of integers, the program should ideally include handling for such cases to maintain robustness. However, even though the problem description assumes valid input, the lack of explicit error handling for non-integer values means the program is not fully correct according to best practices and expected behavior. Therefore, the original assessment needs to be revised to reflect this oversight.
