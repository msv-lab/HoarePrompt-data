Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. Given the problem description to write a function to filter odd numbers, the function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the returned list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The function works correctly for every potential case within the scope of the problem description, assuming valid input. There are no specific edge cases or non-integer values mentioned that would make the function incorrect under the given assumptions. Thus, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
