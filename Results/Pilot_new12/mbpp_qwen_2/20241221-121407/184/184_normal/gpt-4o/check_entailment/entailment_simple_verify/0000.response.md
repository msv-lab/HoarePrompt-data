Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the annotated version confirms that the function processes each element in the list `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers. Since the annotated version aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem statement, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** remains valid.
