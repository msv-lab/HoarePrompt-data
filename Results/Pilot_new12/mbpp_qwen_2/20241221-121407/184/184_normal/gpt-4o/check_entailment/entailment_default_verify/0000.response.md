Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the given code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list as described. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a list of only the odd numbers from the input list. The function handles various scenarios correctly, including lists with multiple odd and even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers. Since the input is assumed to be valid and the function behaves as intended according to the problem description and output hints, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
