Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers and retains only the odd numbers from the input list. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting a list of integers and returning a new list containing only the odd numbers. The examples given in both the original assessment and the output hints demonstrate the function's correctness. Since the function handles the filtering logic correctly and the input is assumed to be valid, there is no evidence to suggest that the program is incorrect based on the problem description and the provided information.
