Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the result list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The examples given show that the function works as expected for different inputs, including edge cases like an empty list, which would return an empty list. There are no apparent issues or missing functionalities that would cause the function to fail for any potential case within the given problem description.
