Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers and keeps only the odd numbers from the input list. The annotations support this by explicitly stating that the function returns a list of odd numbers from the original list `nums`. The provided test cases also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various inputs. Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the logic ensures that only odd numbers are returned, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
