Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out odd numbers from the input list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the result list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with multiple odd and even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers. The function works correctly in all these cases, and no potential edge cases or additional inputs have been found where the function fails to meet the requirement of filtering out odd numbers.
