Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and uses a list comprehension to return a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. This matches the problem description, which asks to write a function to filter odd numbers.

Here are the key points that confirm the program's correctness:

1. The function accepts a list of integers (`nums`) as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the list and includes only those numbers that are odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`).
3. The returned list contains only the odd numbers from the original list.

The provided test cases also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
- `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` returns `[45, 67, 93]`.
- `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

Since the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and passes all the provided test cases, the program is correct.
