Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers and keeps only the odd numbers from the input list. The examples given demonstrate this functionality accurately:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
2. `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` returns `[45, 67, 93]`.
3. `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

Since the function works correctly for the provided test cases and the logic in the function (using a list comprehension with `num % 2 != 0`) ensures that only odd numbers are returned, there doesn't appear to be any edge case that the code fails to handle. Therefore, the program is correct.
