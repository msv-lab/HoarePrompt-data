Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` filters out odd numbers from the input list. The annotated version further clarifies that the function iterates through each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the result list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with multiple odd and even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with only even numbers, and the function works correctly in all these cases. The annotations support the correctness of the function by explicitly stating its behavior and confirming that it meets the problem description of filtering odd numbers. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
