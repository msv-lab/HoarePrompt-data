Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list `nums` and returns a list containing only the odd numbers. This is in line with the problem description, which states that the function should filter odd numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and includes it in the output list only if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). The function handles various cases, including lists with only even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and empty lists, all of which are correctly filtered and returned as expected. Since the function behaves as described in the problem statement for all given assertions, it is correct.
