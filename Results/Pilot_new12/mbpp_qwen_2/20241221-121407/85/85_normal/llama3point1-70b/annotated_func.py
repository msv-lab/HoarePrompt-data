#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. The function does not modify the original list. If the list is empty, the function raises a `ValueError` because it cannot determine both the maximum and minimum values. If the list contains only one element, the function returns 0 since the difference between the single element and itself is zero.
