Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code confirms that the program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Specifically, it finds the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. The original assessment is accurate because the provided program satisfies the problem description without any issues. The annotations also support this correctness by explicitly stating that the program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `arr`. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
