Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. This directly matches the problem description which asks for a function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array (list). The function also handles edge cases appropriately: it raises a `ValueError` if the list is empty, ensuring that it cannot determine both the maximum and minimum values, and returns 0 if the list contains only one element, as the difference between a single element and itself is zero. Given the assumption that the input will be valid, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
