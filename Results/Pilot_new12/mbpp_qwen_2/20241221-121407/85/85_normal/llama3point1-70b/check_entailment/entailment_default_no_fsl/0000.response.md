Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array (list of integers). It uses the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to determine the maximum and minimum values in the list, respectively, and then calculates their difference. 

- For a non-empty list, it returns the correct maximum difference.
- If the list contains a single element, the difference between that element and itself is zero, which is handled correctly by returning 0.
- If the list is empty, the code would raise a `ValueError` due to the lack of elements to determine both the maximum and minimum values. However, the problem description and output hints confirm that this scenario is handled appropriately by raising a `ValueError`, even though this error is not explicitly shown in the code provided. Since the problem statement assumes valid input, this case does not affect the correctness of the program under these assumptions.

Therefore, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all relevant cases.
