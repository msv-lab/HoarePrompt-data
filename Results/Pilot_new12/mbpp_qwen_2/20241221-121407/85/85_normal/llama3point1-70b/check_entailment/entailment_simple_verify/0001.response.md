Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. The annotation confirms that the function operates on a list of integers and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. Since the problem description does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases (such as handling non-integer inputs, empty lists, etc.), and the function handles the basic requirement correctly, the program is indeed correct.
