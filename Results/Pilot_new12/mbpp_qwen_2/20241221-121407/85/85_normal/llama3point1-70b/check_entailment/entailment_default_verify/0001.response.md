Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the output hints. The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. The function handles the edge case where the list is empty by raising a `ValueError`, which aligns with the output hints. Additionally, the function does not modify the original list, and it behaves as expected for a single-element list (returning 0). Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the provided output hints, maintaining the original assessment of correctness.
