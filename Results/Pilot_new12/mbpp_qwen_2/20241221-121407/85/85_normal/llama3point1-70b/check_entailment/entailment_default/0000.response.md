Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. It handles the case where the list is empty by raising a `ValueError`, which aligns with the problem description. For a list with only one element, the function correctly returns 0, as the difference between the single element and itself is zero. The function does not modify the original list, and it operates as expected for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
