Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. The annotation mentions that the function raises a `ValueError` if the list is empty, which is not mentioned in the original assessment but does not affect the correctness based on the problem description, as the problem does not specify how to handle empty lists. The function handles the basic requirement correctly and the annotations support this. Therefore, the original assessment is maintained as correct.
