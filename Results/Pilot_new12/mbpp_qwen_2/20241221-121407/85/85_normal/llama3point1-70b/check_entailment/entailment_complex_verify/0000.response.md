Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. The annotations confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values. The function does not modify the original list and raises a `ValueError` for an empty list, which is a valid handling of the edge case. Since the problem description asks for a function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, and the program fulfills this requirement without any errors or issues, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
