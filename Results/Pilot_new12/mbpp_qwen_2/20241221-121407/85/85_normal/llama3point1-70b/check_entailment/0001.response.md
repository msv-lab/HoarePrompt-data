Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach works correctly for all potential cases as long as the input is a non-empty list of numbers. Since the problem description does not specify any constraints or edge cases beyond the basic requirement, and the function handles these correctly, the program is correct.
