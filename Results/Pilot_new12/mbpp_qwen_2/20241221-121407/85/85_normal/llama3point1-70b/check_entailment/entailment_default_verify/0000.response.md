Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the program `func_1` finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. This approach is valid for arrays containing at least two elements. The output hints further confirm this, noting that the function behaves as expected for lists of integers, including handling empty lists by raising a `ValueError`. The problem description asks for the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array, and the provided function satisfies this requirement without any issues described by the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
