Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. This is achieved by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value in the list using the `max()` and `min()` functions. Since the problem description does not specify any edge cases such as empty lists or non-integer inputs, and the program correctly computes the maximum difference for any valid list of integers, the program is correct.
