Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. This approach works for all potential cases, as it considers the entire range of values present in the array. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this program to fail according to the problem description.
