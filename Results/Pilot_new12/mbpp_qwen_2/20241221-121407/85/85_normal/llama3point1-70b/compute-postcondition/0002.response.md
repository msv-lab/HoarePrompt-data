Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. The function does not modify the original list. If the list is empty, the function raises a `ValueError` because it cannot determine both the maximum and minimum values. If the list contains only one element, the function returns 0 since the difference between the single element and itself is zero.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the function based on the provided code, including potential edge cases such as an empty list and a list with a single element.
