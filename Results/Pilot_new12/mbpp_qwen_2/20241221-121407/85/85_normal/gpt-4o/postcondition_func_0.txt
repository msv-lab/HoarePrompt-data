The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. The function first determines the minimum value (`min_val`) and the maximum value (`max_val`) in the list. It then calculates the difference between these two values (`max_diff`). The function does not handle empty lists; attempting to use an empty list will result in a `ValueError` when calling `min()` or `max()`. The function returns the calculated difference.
