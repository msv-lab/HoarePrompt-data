#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #`The program returns max_diff which is the difference between max_val and min_val in the list 'arr'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. The function first determines the minimum value (`min_val`) and the maximum value (`max_val`) in the list. It then calculates the difference between these two values (`max_diff`). The function does not handle empty lists; attempting to use an empty list will result in a `ValueError` when calling `min()` or `max()`. The function returns the calculated difference.
