The code assigns the minimum value in the list `arr` to the variable `min_val`. Since the exact values in `arr` are not specified, we know that `min_val` will hold the smallest integer from the list `arr`. The length and contents of `arr` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`**
