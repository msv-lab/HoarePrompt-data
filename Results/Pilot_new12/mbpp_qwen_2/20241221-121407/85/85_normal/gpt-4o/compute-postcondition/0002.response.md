`max_diff` is assigned the value of `max_val - min_val`. The values of `arr`, `min_val`, and `max_val` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`, `max_diff` is `max_val - min_val`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum value in `arr`, `max_diff` is `max_val - min_val`**
