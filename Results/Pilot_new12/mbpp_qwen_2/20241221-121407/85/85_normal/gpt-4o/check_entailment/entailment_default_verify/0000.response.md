Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The output hints confirm that the function handles the calculation correctly by determining the minimum and maximum values and returning their difference. Although the output hints mention that the function does not handle empty lists, this is not a requirement stated in the problem description. The function correctly implements the logic to find the maximum difference, and the provided test cases validate its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
