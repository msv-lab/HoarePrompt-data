Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The annotated version confirms that the function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list and then calculates the difference between them. The provided assertions cover various scenarios and demonstrate that the function works as expected. Although the function does not explicitly handle empty lists, the original assessment correctly notes that using an empty list would result in a `ValueError`, which is a valid assumption given the problem description specifies that the input will be valid. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
