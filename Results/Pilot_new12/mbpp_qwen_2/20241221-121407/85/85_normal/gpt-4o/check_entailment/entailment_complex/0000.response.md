Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the list. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Input**: The function accepts a single argument `arr`, which is a list of integers. This aligns with the problem description which states that the function should accept a list of integers.

2. **Calculation of Maximum Difference**: 
   - The function finds the minimum value in the list using `min(arr)`.
   - It then finds the maximum value in the list using `max(arr)`.
   - Finally, it calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values and returns this difference (`max_val - min_val`).

3. **Behavior with Different Inputs**:
   - The function handles both positive and negative integers correctly.
   - The examples provided (`assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4`, `assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8`, `assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2`) demonstrate that the function works correctly for different scenarios, including cases with repeated values and descending order.

4. **Assumptions**: 
   - The problem description assumes that the input will be valid and non-empty. The function correctly throws a `ValueError` when called with an empty list, but since the problem description states that the input will be valid, this edge case is not explicitly handled in the function itself.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
