Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the list. The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the list using the `min()` and `max()` functions, respectively, and then calculates the difference between these values. The test cases provided in the assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given examples. The function handles valid inputs correctly, and the output hints align with the code's behavior. There are no apparent edge cases or invalid input scenarios that the function does not handle, given the assumption that the input will always be valid.
