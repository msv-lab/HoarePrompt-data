Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The annotated code confirms that the function first determines the minimum and maximum values in the array (`arr`), calculates their difference, and returns it. The provided assertions cover different scenarios (ascending order, descending order, and random order) and confirm that the function works as expected. Since the function handles the given problem description correctly for the provided test cases and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to fail, the program remains correct.
