Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the minimum and maximum values and returning their difference. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, handling different scenarios as demonstrated by the assertions. Although the output hints mention that the function does not handle empty lists, which would raise a `ValueError`, this is a valid concern but does not affect the correctness assessment under the assumption that the input will always be valid. Given the problem description and the behavior confirmed by the assertions, the program is correct.
