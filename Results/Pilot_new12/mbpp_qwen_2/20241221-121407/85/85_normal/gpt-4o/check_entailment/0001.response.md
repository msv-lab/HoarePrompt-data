Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and returns their difference. The examples provided in the assertions cover different scenarios (ascending order, descending order, and random order) and confirm that the function works as expected in these cases. Since the function handles the given problem description correctly for the provided test cases and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to fail, the program is correct.
