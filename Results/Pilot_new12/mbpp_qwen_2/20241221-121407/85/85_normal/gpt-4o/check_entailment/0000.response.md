Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and returns their difference. This approach works for all possible arrays of integers, as it considers the smallest and largest elements, which will always yield the maximum difference. The provided test cases also validate this approach:

1. For the array `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `5`, so the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
2. For the array `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `9`, so the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
3. For the array `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `3`, so the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Since the function handles these cases correctly and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
