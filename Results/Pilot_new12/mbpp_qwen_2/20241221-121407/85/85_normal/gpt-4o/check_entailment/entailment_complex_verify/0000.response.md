Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the minimum and maximum values and computing their difference. The provided assertions in the annotated version validate this approach for different scenarios, including arrays with three elements, four elements, and one element (which is effectively the minimum and maximum being the same). Although the annotated version mentions that the function does not handle empty lists, this is acknowledged in the original assessment as well. Since the problem description does not explicitly require handling of edge cases like empty lists, and the provided inputs are valid, the original assessment remains correct.
