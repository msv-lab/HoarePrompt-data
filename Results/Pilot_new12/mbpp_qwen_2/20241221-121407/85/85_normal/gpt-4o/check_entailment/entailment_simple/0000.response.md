Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns the maximum difference between any two elements in the list. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description does not specify any input validation beyond expecting a list of integers. The program does not check if the input is a list or if it contains only integers, but it is assumed that the input will always be valid as per the problem statement.

2. **Functionality**: 
   - The function initializes `min_val` with the minimum value in the array using the `min()` function.
   - It initializes `max_val` with the maximum value in the array using the `max()` function.
   - It calculates `max_diff` as the difference between `max_val` and `min_val`.
   - Finally, it returns `max_diff`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided test different scenarios (positive values, mixed values, and a small list) and confirm that the function works as expected for these cases.

Since the function `func_1` meets the requirements of finding the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array, and the problem description does not include additional constraints (such as handling non-integer inputs or empty lists), the program is correct according to the given problem description.
