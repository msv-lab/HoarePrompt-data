Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function first determines the minimum and maximum values in the array and then calculates their difference. The provided assertions validate this approach for different scenarios. Since the function handles the given test cases correctly and the logic is sound, the program is indeed correct based on the problem description.
