Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then computing their difference. The code handles non-empty lists of integers correctly and produces the expected results as demonstrated by the assertions. Since the code works correctly for the given test cases and the problem description does not specify additional constraints or edge cases (such as non-integer inputs or specific edge cases for the array contents), the code meets the requirements for all potential cases within the given constraints.
