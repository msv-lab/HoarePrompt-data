Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is a list of lists, and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in the list `sublists`. It iterates over each sublist in `sublists` and extracts the first element of each sublist to form a new list. This new list is then returned. If any sublist in `sublists` is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will contain `None`. Additionally, if `sublists` itself is empty, the function will return an empty list.**
