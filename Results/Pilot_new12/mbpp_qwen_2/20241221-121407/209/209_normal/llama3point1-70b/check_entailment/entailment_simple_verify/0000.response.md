Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly iterates through each sublist in the input list `sublists` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. This directly aligns with the problem description, which requires a function to get the first element of each sublist. Since the annotated version supports the correctness and there are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned that could cause the function to fail under valid inputs, the original assessment remains valid.
