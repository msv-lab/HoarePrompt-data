Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code correctly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function iterates over each sublist in `sublists` and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist. If any sublist is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will contain `None`. The problem description asks for a function that gets the first element of each sublist, which is exactly what this function does. Since the annotations accurately reflect the function's behavior and the function meets the problem description, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
