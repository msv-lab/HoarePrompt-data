Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list `sublists`. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in `sublists`, which aligns with the problem description. Although the function will raise an `IndexError` if any sublist is empty, the original assessment correctly notes that the problem description does not specify handling of such cases. Therefore, the function is considered correct under the given assumptions.
