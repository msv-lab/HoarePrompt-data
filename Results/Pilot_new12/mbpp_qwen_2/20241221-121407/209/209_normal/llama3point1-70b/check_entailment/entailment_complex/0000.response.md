Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is expected to be a list of lists. The function then returns a list containing the first element of each sublist within `sublists`. 

- If any sublist in `sublists` is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will indeed contain `None`. This is handled correctly by the list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]`, which will attempt to access the first element of each sublist and will result in `None` if the sublist is empty.
- If `sublists` itself is empty, the function will return an empty list, as there are no sublists to extract elements from.

Thus, the program accurately fulfills the requirement stated in the problem description.
