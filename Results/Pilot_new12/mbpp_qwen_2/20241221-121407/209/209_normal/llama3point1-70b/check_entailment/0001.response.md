Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list `sublists`. This works for all potential cases where `sublists` contains at least one sublist with at least one element. If any sublist is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`. However, since the problem description does not specify handling of empty sublists, the function is considered correct as it adheres to the given requirements.
