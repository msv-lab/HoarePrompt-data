Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates over each sublist in the input `sublists` and extracts the first element of each sublist to form a new list. The code handles the case where a sublist is empty by placing `None` in the corresponding position in the returned list. It also correctly returns an empty list if `sublists` itself is an empty list. Since the problem description and the output hints do not specify any other conditions or edge cases that the code needs to handle, and the code appears to meet the requirements for all mentioned scenarios, the code is correct.
