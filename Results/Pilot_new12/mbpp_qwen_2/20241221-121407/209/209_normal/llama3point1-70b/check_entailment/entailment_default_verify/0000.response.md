Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly returns the first element of each sublist in the given list of sublists. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `None` for any empty sublist and an empty list for an empty input list. Since the problem description asks for the first element of each sublist and the function accomplishes this without error under the assumption of valid input, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
