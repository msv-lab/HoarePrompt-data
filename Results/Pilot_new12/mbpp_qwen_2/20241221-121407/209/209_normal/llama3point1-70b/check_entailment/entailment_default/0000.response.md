Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of sublists as input and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. This matches the problem description. The code handles all potential cases:

- If a sublist is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will contain `None`.
- If the input list `sublists` itself is empty, the function will return an empty list.

Since the code satisfies the requirements for every potential case described, the correctness is **True**.
