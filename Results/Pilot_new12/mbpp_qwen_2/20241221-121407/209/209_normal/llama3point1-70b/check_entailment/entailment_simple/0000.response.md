Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`sublists`) as input and returns a new list containing the first element from each sublist. This exactly matches the requirement specified in the problem description. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]` iterates over each sublist in `sublists` and extracts the first element (`sublist[0]`). Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for for every potential valid case.
