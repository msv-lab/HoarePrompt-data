Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` adheres to the problem description of extracting the first element from each sublist in the input list `sublists`. The output hints further confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns a list containing the first element of each sublist, with `None` in the position of any empty sublist. Since the problem description does not require special handling for empty sublists, the function's current implementation is sufficient and correct. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
