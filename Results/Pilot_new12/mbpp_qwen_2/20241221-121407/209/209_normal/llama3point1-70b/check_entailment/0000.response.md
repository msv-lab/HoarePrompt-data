Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the first element of each sublist in the given list of sublists. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and extract the first element, which satisfies the requirement of the problem description. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios where this function would fail as long as the input is a list of sublists. Therefore, the function works correctly for all given cases.
