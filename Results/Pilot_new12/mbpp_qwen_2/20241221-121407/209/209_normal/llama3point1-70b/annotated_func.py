#State of the program right berfore the function call: sublists is a list of lists.
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in the list `sublists`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is a list of lists, and returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in the list `sublists`. It iterates over each sublist in `sublists` and extracts the first element of each sublist to form a new list. This new list is then returned. If any sublist in `sublists` is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will contain `None`. Additionally, if `sublists` itself is empty, the function will return an empty list.
