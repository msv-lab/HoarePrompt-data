Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list containing the first element from each sublist. The program correctly uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and extracts the first element of each sublist. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Therefore, the program is correct and always follows the problem description.
