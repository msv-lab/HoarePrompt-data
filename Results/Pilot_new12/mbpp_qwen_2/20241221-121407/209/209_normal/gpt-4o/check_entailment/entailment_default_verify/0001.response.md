Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list `lst`. The output hints confirm that the function handles the expected behavior, including cases where sublists are empty, returning `None` in such instances. The function also correctly returns an empty list if the input list itself is empty. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
