Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of sublists and returns a new list containing the first element from each sublist. The examples given in the problem description show that the function works as expected for various inputs:

- `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])` returns `[1, 3, 6]`.
- `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])` returns `[1, 4]`.
- `func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]])` returns `[9, 1]`.

The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` effectively extracts the first element from each sublist. Even if a sublist is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will be `None`, which is consistent with the problem description. There are no potential cases mentioned in the hints or elsewhere that the provided code does not handle correctly. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
