Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to take a list of lists (`lst`) as input and return a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The given code snippet correctly implements this functionality using a list comprehension, which iterates over each sublist in `lst` and selects the first element of each sublist.

Here are the key points that demonstrate the correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of lists. This matches the problem description.

2. **Output Generation**: The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in `lst`.

3. **Edge Cases**: While the problem description does not explicitly mention handling cases like empty sublists or an empty `lst`, the provided implementation will handle these cases gracefully. An empty sublist will result in `None` being added to the output list, and an empty `lst` will result in an empty output list.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the comments correctly validate the behavior of the function for different inputs, confirming its correctness.

Given the provided problem description and the annotated program, the function `func_1` consistently produces the desired output for all potential cases, making the program correct.
