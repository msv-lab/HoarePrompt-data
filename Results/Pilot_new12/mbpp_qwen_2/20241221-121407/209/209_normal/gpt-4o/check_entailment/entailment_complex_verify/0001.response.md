Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each sublist in the input list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. The provided assertions in the annotated version also correctly demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. Since the function works correctly for the given examples and the logic is sound for extracting the first element from each sublist, the program is correct. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is appropriate.
