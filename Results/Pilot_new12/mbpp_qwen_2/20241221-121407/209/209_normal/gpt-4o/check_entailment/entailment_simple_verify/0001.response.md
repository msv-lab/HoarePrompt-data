Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list. The annotations clearly indicate that `lst` is a list of lists, and the function processes each sublist to return a list of their respective first elements. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** remains valid.
