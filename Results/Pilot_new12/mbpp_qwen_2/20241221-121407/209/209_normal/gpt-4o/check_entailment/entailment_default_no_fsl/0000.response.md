Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses a list comprehension to extract the first element from each sublist in the input list `lst`. The code handles cases where sublists are empty by simply not including any value for those sublists in the output, which aligns with the output hints. Additionally, it correctly handles cases where `lst` itself is empty, resulting in an empty output list. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case described in the problem statement and hints.
