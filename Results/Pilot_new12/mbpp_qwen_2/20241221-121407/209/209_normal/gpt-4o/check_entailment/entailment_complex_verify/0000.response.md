Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the given list of lists. The provided annotations further clarify that the function handles cases where sublists are empty by including `None` in the result, which is not explicitly mentioned in the original problem description but is a reasonable assumption given the behavior of list comprehensions in Python. 

Given the provided assertions and the logical structure of the function, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function works correctly for the given examples and the logic is sound. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
