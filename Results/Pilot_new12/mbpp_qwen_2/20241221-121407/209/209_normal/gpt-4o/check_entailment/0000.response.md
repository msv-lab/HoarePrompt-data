Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the given list of lists. The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]` iterates through each sublist and selects the first element. Given the assertions provided:

- `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])` returns `[1, 3, 6]`.
- `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])` returns `[1, 4]`.
- `func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]])` returns `[9, 1]`.

These examples cover various cases, including sublists of different lengths. Since the function works correctly for the provided examples and the logic is sound, it is reasonable to conclude that the function will work correctly for any list of sublists where each sublist contains at least one element. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described.
