Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the given list of lists. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling cases where sublists are empty by returning `None` in the corresponding position of the result list. Since the provided examples and the logic of the function align with the problem description and the output hints, the program meets the requirements. Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the final assessment remains True.
