Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` is designed to take a list of lists (`lst`) as input and return a list containing the first element of each sublist. The provided assertions validate this functionality. Each assertion demonstrates that the function correctly extracts the first element from each sublist, regardless of the length of the sublists. The logic within the function is straightforward and correct, and the provided examples cover various scenarios, ensuring the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is valid.
