Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the input list. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list `lst` and selects the first element (`sublist[0]`) of each sublist. This logic is consistent across all provided test cases and appears to handle the task as described without any issues. Since the function works correctly for the given examples and the logic seems sound for extracting the first element from each sublist, the program is correct.
