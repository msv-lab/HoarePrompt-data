#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists (i.e., each element of lst is also a list).
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #A list containing the first element of each sublist in lst
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists. It returns a new list containing the first element from each sublist in `lst`. If any sublist in `lst` is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will contain `None`. If `lst` itself is empty, the returned list will also be empty.
