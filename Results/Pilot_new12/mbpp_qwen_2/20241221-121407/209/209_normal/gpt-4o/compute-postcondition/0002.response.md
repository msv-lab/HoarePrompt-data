Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of lists. It returns a new list containing the first element from each sublist in `lst`. If any sublist in `lst` is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will contain `None`. If `lst` itself is empty, the returned list will also be empty.**

- The function iterates over each sublist in `lst` and extracts the first element of each sublist.
- If a sublist is empty, the list comprehension will include `None` at that position.
- If `lst` is empty, the resulting list will also be empty.
