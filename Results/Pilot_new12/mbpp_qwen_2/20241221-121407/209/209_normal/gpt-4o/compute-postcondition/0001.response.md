The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of lists, meaning each element of `lst` is also a list. The function returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in `lst`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` where each element is a list, and return a list containing the first element from each sublist in `lst`.
