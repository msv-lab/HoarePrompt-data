Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clearly states that the function `func_1` returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is obtained by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` and taking every `n`-th element. However, the problem description requires the function to split the list for every nth element and return a list of the resulting lists. The current implementation does not achieve this; instead, it creates sublists starting from every index up to `n-1` and then uses slicing to get every nth element from those starting points. This results in more sublists than required and does not align with the intended functionality. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is maintained.
