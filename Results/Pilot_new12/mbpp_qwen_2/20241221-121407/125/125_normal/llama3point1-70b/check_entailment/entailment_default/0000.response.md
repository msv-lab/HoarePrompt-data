Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. For a given list `lst` and an integer `n`, the function `func_1` returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is formed by taking every `n`-th element starting from each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`. This satisfies the requirement of splitting the list for every `n`th element.

The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function slices `lst` starting from index `i` and taking every `n`-th element thereafter. This matches the implementation provided:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

This code works correctly for every potential case, as long as `lst` is a valid list and `n` is a positive integer. The function handles the case where `n` is greater than the length of `lst` by producing an empty sublist, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case, and the correctness is **True**.
