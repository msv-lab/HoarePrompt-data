Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list (`lst`) and an integer (`n`). This matches the requirement to take a list and an integer as inputs.

2. **Slicing Mechanism**: The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of sublists. Each sublist is obtained by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` and taking every `n`-th element. Specifically, the slice `lst[i::n]` starts at index `i` and skips `n-1` elements between each item, which is exactly what is required to split the list every `n` elements.

3. **Range of Slices**: The loop iterates over `i` in the range `range(n)`, meaning it will generate `n` sublists, one for each starting index from `0` to `n-1`. This ensures that the entire list is split into sublists as specified.

4. **Return Type**: The function returns a list of these sublists, which is the expected output format.

Since the program follows the exact logic required by the problem description for any valid input (list and positive integer `n`), the program is correct.
