Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The annotated version clarifies that the program returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is obtained by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` and taking every `n`-th element, for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. However, this does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description, which asks for a list of lists where each sublist contains elements from the original list at intervals of `n`. 

The annotated version shows that the current implementation creates sublists starting from every index up to `n-1` and then uses slicing to get every `n`-th element from those starting points, leading to incorrect results as demonstrated in the example provided (e.g., for the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the expected output is `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, but the program produces `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5], [6]]`).

Therefore, the original assessment is correct, and the program does not meet the problem description.
