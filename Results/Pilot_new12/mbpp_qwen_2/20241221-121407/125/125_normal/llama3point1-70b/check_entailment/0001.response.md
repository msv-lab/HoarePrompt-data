Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into sublists every nth element. For any given list and integer n, the function uses a list comprehension to create sublists starting from each index in the range `[0, n)`. This ensures that the original list is divided into sublists at every nth element, which aligns with the problem description. Since the function works correctly for all tested cases and there are no edge cases or inputs that would cause it to fail based on the given implementation, the correctness is True.
