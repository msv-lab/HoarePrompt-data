Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` splits the list into sublists every nth element. The annotated version confirms that the function uses a list comprehension to create sublists starting from each index in the range `[0, n)`, which means it divides the original list into sublists at every nth element. This approach is consistent with the problem description and the provided annotation. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program's correctness is maintained as True.
