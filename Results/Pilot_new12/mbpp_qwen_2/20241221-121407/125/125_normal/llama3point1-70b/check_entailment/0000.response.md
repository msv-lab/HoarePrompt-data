Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly split the list for every nth element. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from the original list at intervals of n. However, the current implementation creates sublists starting from every index up to n-1 and then uses slicing to get every nth element from those starting points.

For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`. The expected output is `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, but the program will produce `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5], [6]]`.

To fix this, the program should create sublists such that each sublist starts from every nth element and spans the entire length of the list. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(lst[i::n])
    return result
```

This corrected version ensures that the function returns the desired output for any list and any positive integer n.
