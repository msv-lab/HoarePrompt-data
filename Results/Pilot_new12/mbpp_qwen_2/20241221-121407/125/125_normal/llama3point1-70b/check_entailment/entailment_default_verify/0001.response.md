Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` splits the list into sublists every nth element. The output hints further clarify that each sublist is formed by slicing the original list starting from index `i` (where `i` ranges from 0 to `n-1`) and taking every `n`-th element thereafter. This behavior matches the problem description and the output hints provided. Since the function handles all specified cases and behaves as expected, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
