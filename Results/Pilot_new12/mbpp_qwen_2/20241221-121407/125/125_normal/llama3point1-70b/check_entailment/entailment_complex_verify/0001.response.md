Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into sublists every nth element, as described in the problem statement. The annotated version confirms that for each starting index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, the function creates a sublist by slicing the original list `lst` starting from `i` and taking every `n`-th element thereafter. This approach ensures that the original list is divided into sublists at every nth element, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the given implementation and the assumptions about valid input. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
