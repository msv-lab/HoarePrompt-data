Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(lst, n)` takes two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `n`, which is a positive integer.
2. **Slicing Logic**: The line `return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` creates a list of sublists. For each starting index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`, it slices the original list `lst` starting from `i` and takes every `n`-th element thereafter. This matches the requirement of splitting the list for every `n`th element.
3. **Edge Cases**: The solution correctly handles cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`. In such cases, the corresponding sublist will be empty, which aligns with the problem description.
4. **Assumptions**: As stated, we assume valid inputs, so the program is robust within its defined scope.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
