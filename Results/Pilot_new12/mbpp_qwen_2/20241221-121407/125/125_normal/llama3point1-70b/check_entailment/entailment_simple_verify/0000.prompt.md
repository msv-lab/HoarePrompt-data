You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly split the list for every nth element. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of lists, where each sublist contains elements from the original list at intervals of n. However, the current implementation creates sublists starting from every index up to n-1 and then uses slicing to get every nth element from those starting points.

For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`. The expected output is `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`, but the program will produce `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6], [3, 5], [4, 6], [5], [6]]`.

To fix this, the program should create sublists such that each sublist starts from every nth element and spans the entire length of the list. Here's a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(lst[i::n])
    return result
```

This corrected version ensures that the function returns the desired output for any list and any positive integer n.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that n > 0.
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is obtained by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` and taking every `n`-th element, for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
