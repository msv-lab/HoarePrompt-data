Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists where each sublist starts from an index `i` (ranging from 0 to `n-1`) and includes every `n`-th element thereafter. This matches the problem description and output hints. For example:

- If `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n = 2`, the output will be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`.
- If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the corresponding sublist will be empty, which also aligns with the description.

Since the code handles all cases described in the problem and output hints, the correctness is True.
