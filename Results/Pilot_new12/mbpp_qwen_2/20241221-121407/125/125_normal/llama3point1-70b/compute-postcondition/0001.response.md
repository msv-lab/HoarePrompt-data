The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that `n > 0`. The function returns a list of sublists, where each sublist is obtained by slicing `lst` starting from index `i` and taking every `n`-th element, for `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of sublists obtained by slicing `lst` at intervals of `n`.
