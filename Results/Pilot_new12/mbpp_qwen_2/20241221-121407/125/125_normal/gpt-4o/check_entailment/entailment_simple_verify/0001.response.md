Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists at every nth element. The function initializes a list of sublists (`result`) and populates it using the modulo operator, which ensures that elements are distributed across the sublists based on the specified interval `n`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and demonstrate that the function behaves as expected. The annotations confirm that the function correctly handles the distribution of elements and returns the expected results. Therefore, the original assessment that the function is correct remains valid.
