Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists at every nth element. The output hints confirm that the function distributes elements among `n` sublists using the modulo operation, which aligns with the requirement. The test cases provided in the problem description cover various scenarios, and the logic in the function supports the expected behavior. There are no edge cases mentioned in the output hints that would cause the function to fail, and the function handles the specified range for `n` (i.e., \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\)). Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
