Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists based on the given interval `n`. The function uses a loop to iterate through the list and appends elements to the appropriate sublist based on their index modulo `n`. The test cases provided cover different scenarios including lists with different lengths and various values of `n`, and the function works as expected in all cases. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where the function fails based on the given examples and the problem description.
