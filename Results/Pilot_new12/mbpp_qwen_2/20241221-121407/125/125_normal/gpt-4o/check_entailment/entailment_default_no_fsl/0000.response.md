Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It uses a modulo operation to distribute elements from the input list into `n` sublists. The assertions provided also validate different scenarios, including cases with different lengths of lists and different values of `n`. The code handles the case where `0 < n <= len(lst)` as specified and works correctly for the given examples. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
