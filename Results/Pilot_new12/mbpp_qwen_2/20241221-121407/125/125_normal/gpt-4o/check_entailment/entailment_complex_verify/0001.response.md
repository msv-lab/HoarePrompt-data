Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists at every nth element. The annotations confirm that the function distributes the elements of the list into sublists based on the modulo operation with `n`, which aligns with the problem description. The test cases provided also demonstrate that the function works as intended for different list sizes and values of `n`. The annotated version further clarifies the state of the program at various points, supporting the correctness of the function. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
