Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly split the input list into sublists at every nth element. The test cases provided cover different scenarios, including different list sizes and different values of n. The function uses the modulo operator to distribute elements across the sublists, which aligns with the requirement to split the list for every nth element. Since the provided test cases and the logic in the function suggest that the function works correctly for the given examples and no edge cases were identified that would cause the function to fail, the function can be considered correct.
