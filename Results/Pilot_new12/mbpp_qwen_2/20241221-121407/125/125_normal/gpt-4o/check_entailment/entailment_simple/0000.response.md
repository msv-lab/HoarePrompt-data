Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list (`lst`) and an integer (`n`). This matches the requirement of taking a list and an integer `n`.

2. **Splitting Logic**: The function uses a list comprehension to create `n` empty sublists in the `result` list. It then iterates over each element in the input list `lst`, appending each element to the appropriate sublist in `result` based on the index modulo `n`. This ensures that every `n`th element is placed into a new sublist, as required.

3. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases demonstrate the expected behavior:
   - When `n=3`, the elements are split into sublists every 3rd element.
   - When `n=2`, the elements are split into sublists every 2nd element.

4. **Edge Cases**: The provided solution handles edge cases well, such as:
   - Lists with fewer than `n` elements.
   - Empty lists.
   - Lists with non-integer elements (the function assumes the input is valid).

5. **Output Format**: The function returns a list of sublists, which matches the expected output format.

Since the program correctly implements the specified functionality and handles all relevant cases, it is correct according to the problem description.
