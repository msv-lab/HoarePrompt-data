Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, a list (`lst`) and a positive integer (`n`), which aligns with the problem description.
2. **Logic Implementation**: The function creates a list of `n` empty sublists, initializes an index `i` starting from 0, and then iterates through each element in the input list `lst`. For each element, it appends the element to the sublist corresponding to the index `i % n`. After appending, it updates `i` to `i + 1`. This logic ensures that elements from `lst` are distributed among the `n` sublists based on their index modulo `n`.
3. **Output Format**: The function returns a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`, which matches the expected output format described in the problem.
4. **Edge Cases**: Although no explicit edge cases are handled (like non-list inputs or invalid `n` values), the problem description states that we assume valid inputs, so this is not a requirement for correctness under the given assumptions.

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
