Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` appears to be correct. The function initializes a list of sublists, each with a capacity of `n`, and iterates over the input list `lst`, appending elements to the corresponding sublist based on the modulo operation. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including lists with various lengths and different types of elements, and the function produces the expected results. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at key points, indicating that the function behaves as intended. Since the function handles the input validation implicitly by assuming valid input, and the provided examples demonstrate its correctness, the original assessment is accurate.
