Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to split a list into sublists based on the given interval `n`. The annotated version clearly explains that the function distributes elements from the input list `lst` into `n` sublists, where each element is placed in the sublist corresponding to the result of its index modulo `n`. This matches the problem description, which requires the function to split a list for every `n`th element.

The original assessment is accurate because:
1. The function handles the specified range for `n` (i.e., `0 < n <= len(lst)`).
2. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected.
3. The annotated version supports the correctness of the implementation by detailing the state of the program at different points and explaining the logic behind the distribution of elements.

Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
