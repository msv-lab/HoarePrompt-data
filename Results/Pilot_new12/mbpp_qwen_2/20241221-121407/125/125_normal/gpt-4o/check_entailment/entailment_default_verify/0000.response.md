Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function indeed splits the input list into sublists based on the given interval `n`. The output hints further clarify that the function distributes elements from the input list into `n` sublists using the modulo operation, which aligns with the problem description. The function handles the case where `0 < n <= len(lst)`, as specified, and there are no additional edge cases that need to be explicitly handled according to the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
