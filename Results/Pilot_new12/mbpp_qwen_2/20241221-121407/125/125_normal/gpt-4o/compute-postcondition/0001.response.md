Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `lst` is a list.
   - `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\).
   - `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```
   for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `lst` using `enumerate`.
   - `enumerate` generates pairs `(i, element)` where `i` is the index and `element` is the corresponding value from `lst`.

4. **State Adjustments Needed**:
   - The loop can only execute if `lst` contains elements to iterate over.
   - Since `n` is defined as \(0 < n \leq \text{len(lst)}\), `lst` must have at least `n` elements.
   - The variable `i` starts at 0 and increments with each iteration.
   - The variable `element` corresponds to the elements of `lst` as per the enumeration.

5. **Final State Before the First Iteration**:
   - `lst` must contain at least `n` elements.
   - `i` should be 0 for the first iteration.
   - `element` will be the first element of `lst`.

Therefore, the required adjustments are:

State: **`lst` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element of `lst`, `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists**
