Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States**:
   - `lst` is a list with at least `n` elements.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists.
   - The first sublist of `result` contains the first element of `lst`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists.
   - The first sublist of `result` contains the first element of `lst`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `lst`.
   - Since `i` is currently 0, it needs to be incremented to 1 for the next iteration.
   - The first element of `lst` is already placed in the first sublist of `result`. For the next iteration, the second element of `lst` should be processed, and it will be placed in the second sublist of `result`.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `i` will be incremented to 1.
   - The second element of `lst` should be considered for processing.
   - The second sublist of `result` will contain the second element of `lst`.

Therefore, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`lst` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is 1, `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists where the first sublist contains the first element of `lst` and the second sublist will be filled with the second element of `lst`.**
