Let's go through the steps:

1. Initial State:
   - `lst` is a list with at least `n` elements.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists where the first sublist contains the first element of `lst` and its index (0), and the second sublist contains the second element of `lst` and its index (1).

2. Code Execution:
   - `result[i % n].append(element)`
     - `i % n` means the remainder when `i` (which is 2) is divided by `n`.
     - So, `i % n` is 2.
     - `result[2]` is the third sublist in the `result` list.
     - Since `result` has `n` sublists, the third sublist (index 2) would be initially empty (as all sublists are empty).
     - The `element` to be appended is the third element of `lst` (since `lst` has at least `n` elements, the third element exists).
     - After appending, the third sublist will contain the third element of `lst` and its index (2).

3. Updated Values:
   - `i` remains unchanged, so `i` is 2.
   - `result` now has the updated third sublist.

Output State: **`lst` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is 2, `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists where the first sublist contains the first element of `lst` and its index (0), the second sublist contains the second element of `lst` and its index (1), and the third sublist contains the third element of `lst` and its index (2)**.
