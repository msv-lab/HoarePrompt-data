The code `result[i % n].append(element)` impacts the following:

- `i` is initially set to 1.
- `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists, with the first sublist containing the first element of `lst`.

Given that `i` is 1, `i % n` will evaluate to 1 (assuming `n > 1`), because the modulo operation with `n` on 1 will give 1.

The line `result[i % n].append(element)` means that the `element` is appended to the sublist in `result` whose index is `i % n`. Since `i % n` is 1, the first sublist of `result` (which initially contains the first element of `lst`) will now contain the first element of `lst` and the `element`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`lst` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is 1, `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists where the first sublist contains the first element of `lst` and the `element`**
