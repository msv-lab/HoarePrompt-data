#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list with at least `n` elements, `i` is `len(lst) - 1`, `result` is a list containing `n` sublists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`.
    return result
    #`The program returns a list 'result' containing 'n' sublists, where each sublist contains elements from 'lst' based on the modulo operation with 'n', and 'i' is len(lst) - 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list `result` containing `n` sublists. Each sublist in `result` contains elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`. Specifically, the elements of `lst` are distributed among the `n` sublists such that the index of each element in `result` corresponds to the remainder when the index of the element in `lst` is divided by `n`. The variable `i` is set to `len(lst) - 1` after the loop completes. The function handles the case where `0 < n <= len(lst)` as specified. No additional edge cases are explicitly handled in the code.
