The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list `result` containing `n` sublists. Each sublist in `result` contains elements from `lst` based on the modulo operation with `n`. Specifically, the elements of `lst` are distributed among the `n` sublists such that the index of each element in `result` corresponds to the remainder when the index of the element in `lst` is divided by `n`. The variable `i` is set to `len(lst) - 1` after the loop completes. The function handles the case where `0 < n <= len(lst)` as specified. No additional edge cases are explicitly handled in the code.
