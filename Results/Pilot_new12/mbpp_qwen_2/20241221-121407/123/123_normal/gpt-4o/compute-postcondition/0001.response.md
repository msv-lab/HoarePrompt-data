The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `L`, which is an integer such that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)}\). The function returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and returns two lists where the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.**
