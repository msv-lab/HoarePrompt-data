Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L` such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. It returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to index `L` (inclusive), and the second list contains elements from index `L+1` to the end of `lst`. This function effectively splits the input list `lst` into two sublists based on the given index `L`. If `L` is `0`, the first list will be empty, and the second list will contain all elements of `lst`. If `L` is equal to `len(lst)`, the first list will contain all elements of `lst`, and the second list will be empty. There are no missing functionalities, and the annotations accurately describe the behavior of the function.**
