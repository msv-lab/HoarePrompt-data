Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs and returns a tuple containing two sublists: the first sublist contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second sublist contains the remaining elements of `lst`. The program uses list slicing to achieve this:

- `lst[:L]` returns the first `L` elements of `lst`.
- `lst[L:]` returns the elements of `lst` starting from index `L` to the end.

The program also includes assertions that test the function with different inputs to ensure its correctness. Given the problem description and the provided tests, the function behaves as expected for all tested cases. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
