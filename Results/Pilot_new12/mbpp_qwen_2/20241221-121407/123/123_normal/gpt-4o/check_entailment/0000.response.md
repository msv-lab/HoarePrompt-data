Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts based on the given length `L`. It returns a tuple containing the first part of the list up to index `L` and the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list. The examples provided also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since the function handles the splitting logic correctly and produces the expected output for the given examples, it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
