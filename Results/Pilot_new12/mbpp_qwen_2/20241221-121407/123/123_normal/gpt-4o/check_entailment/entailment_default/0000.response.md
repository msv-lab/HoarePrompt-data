Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` and returns a tuple of two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to index `L` (inclusive), and the second list contains elements from index `L+1` to the end of `lst`. The code handles all valid cases where `0 <= L <= len(lst)` and produces the expected results as shown in the assertions. The code works correctly for the given examples and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or output hints that the code fails to handle.
