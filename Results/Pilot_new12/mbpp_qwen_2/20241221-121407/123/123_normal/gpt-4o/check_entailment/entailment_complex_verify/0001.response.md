Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts as specified. The annotations correctly describe the behavior of the function, indicating that the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. The test cases also validate the function's correctness across different scenarios. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
