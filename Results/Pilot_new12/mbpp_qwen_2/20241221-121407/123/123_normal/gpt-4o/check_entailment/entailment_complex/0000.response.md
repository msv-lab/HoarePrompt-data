Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs and returns a tuple containing two lists:
   - The first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to index `L` (inclusive).
   - The second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If `L` is `0`, the first list will be empty, and the second list will contain all elements of `lst`.
   - If `L` is equal to `len(lst)`, the first list will contain all elements of `lst`, and the second list will be empty.

3. **Annotations and Comments**:
   - The provided assertions confirm the expected behavior for different cases, ensuring the function works as intended.
   - The comments within the code accurately describe the behavior of the function, matching the problem description.

Since the function consistently returns the correct output based on the provided problem description and handles edge cases appropriately, the program is correct.
