Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into two parts based on the given integer `L`. The annotations correctly describe the behavior of the function, indicating that it returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to index `L` (inclusive), and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for the given examples. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
