Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the given integer L. The annotations confirm that the function returns a tuple containing the first part of the list (with length L) and the second part of the list (the remaining elements). The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function works correctly for these cases. The logic for splitting the list using slicing (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) is sound, and the annotations support the correctness of the program. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
