Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the given integer L. The function returns a tuple containing the first part of the list (with length L) and the second part of the list (the remaining elements). The provided test cases cover different scenarios including lists with different lengths and elements, and integer values for L that are both less than and greater than half the length of the list. Since the function works correctly for these cases and the logic appears sound for splitting the list, we can conclude that the program is correct.
