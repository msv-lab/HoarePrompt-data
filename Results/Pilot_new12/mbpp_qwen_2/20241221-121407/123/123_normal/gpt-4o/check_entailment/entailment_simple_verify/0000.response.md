Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts based on the given length `L`. The annotations support this by indicating that the function returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. The examples provided in the assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
