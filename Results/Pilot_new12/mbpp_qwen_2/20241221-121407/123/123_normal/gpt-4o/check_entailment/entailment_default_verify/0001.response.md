Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the given integer `L`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning two lists where the first list contains elements from the start of the input list up to index `L` (inclusive), and the second list contains elements from index `L+1` to the end of the list. The function handles edge cases where `L` is `0` or equal to the length of the list, returning the appropriate sublists. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
