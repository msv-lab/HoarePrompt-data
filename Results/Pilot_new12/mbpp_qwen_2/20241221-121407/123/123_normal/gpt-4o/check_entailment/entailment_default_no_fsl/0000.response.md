Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the given integer `L`. The function handles all the described cases:

- When `L` is `0`, the first list is empty, and the second list contains all elements of the input list.
- When `L` is equal to the length of the input list, the first list contains all elements of the input list, and the second list is empty.
- For any other value of `L`, the function correctly splits the list into two parts as required.

The examples provided in the problem description and the assertions confirm that the function works as expected for these cases. Since the function handles all potential cases within the constraints `0 <= L <= len(lst)` and produces the correct output, the code is correct.
