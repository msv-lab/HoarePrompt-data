Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts based on the given length `L` and returns them as a tuple. The output hints further clarify that the function handles all valid cases where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, ensuring that the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to index `L` (inclusive), and the second list contains elements from index `L+1` to the end of `lst`. The examples provided in the output hints, such as when `L` is `0` or `len(lst)`, are correctly handled, confirming that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
