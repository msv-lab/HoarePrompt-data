The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L` as parameters. It returns two lists: the first list contains the elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains the elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. This division ensures that all elements in the original list `lst` are accounted for in the returned lists. If `L` is `0`, the first returned list will be empty, and the second list will contain all elements of `lst`. Conversely, if `L` equals `len(lst)`, the first list will contain all elements of `lst`, and the second list will be empty. If `L` is out of bounds (i.e., less than `0` or greater than `len(lst)`), the function will still execute, but the returned lists may not accurately reflect the intended slicing due to the bounds check in the list slicing operation.
