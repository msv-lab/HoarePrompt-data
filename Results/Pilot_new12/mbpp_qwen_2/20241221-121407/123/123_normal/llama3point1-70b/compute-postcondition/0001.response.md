The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `L`, which is an integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. The function returns two lists: the first list contains the elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains the elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.
