Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as parameters and returns two lists in a tuple. The first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. This exactly matches the requirement specified in the problem description. Additionally, the explanation provided in the comments correctly describes the behavior of the function, including the cases where `L` is `0` or equal to the length of `lst`. Therefore, the program is correct.
