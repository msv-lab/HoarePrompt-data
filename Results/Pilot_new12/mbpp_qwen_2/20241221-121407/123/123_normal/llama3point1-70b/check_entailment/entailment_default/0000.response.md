Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly splits the given list into two parts based on the specified length `L` and returns them as a tuple. The function `func_1` adheres to the problem description for every potential case:

- When `L` is `0`, the first list will be empty, and the second list will contain all elements of `lst`.
- When `L` is equal to `len(lst)`, the first list will contain all elements of `lst`, and the second list will be empty.
- For any other value of `L`, the first list will contain elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list will contain the remaining elements of `lst`.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for different values of `L`, including edge cases like `L = 0` and `L = len(lst)`. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
