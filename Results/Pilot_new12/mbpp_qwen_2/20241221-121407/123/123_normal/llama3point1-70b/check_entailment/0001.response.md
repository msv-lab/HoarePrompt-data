Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains the remaining elements. This satisfies the problem description for all potential cases. The slicing operation `lst[:L]` extracts the first `L` elements, and `lst[L:]` extracts the rest of the list starting from index `L`. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as `L` is a valid index for the list.
