Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function returns the first list containing elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list containing elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. This behavior aligns with the problem description, and the program handles all potential cases correctly, as explained in the original assessment.
