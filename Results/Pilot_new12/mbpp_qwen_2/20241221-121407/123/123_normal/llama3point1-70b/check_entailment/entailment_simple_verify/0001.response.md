Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`, and the second part contains the remaining elements. The annotation confirms that the function returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. Since the function handles the slicing operation correctly for all valid inputs as per the assumption that the input is always valid, the original assessment remains correct.
