Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. This solution works for all potential cases:

- When `L` is within the bounds of the list (0 ≤ L ≤ len(lst)), the function returns the correct split.
- When `L` is 0, it returns `([], lst)`.
- When `L` is equal to the length of the list, it returns `(lst, [])`.

Since the program handles all these cases correctly, it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential input.
