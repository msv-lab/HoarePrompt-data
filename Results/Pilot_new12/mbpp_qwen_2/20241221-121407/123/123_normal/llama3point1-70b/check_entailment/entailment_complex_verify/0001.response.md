Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains the remaining elements. The annotations clarify that the function returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. The annotations also mention that if `L` is `0`, the first returned list will be empty, and if `L` equals `len(lst)`, the second list will be empty. These conditions ensure that all elements in the original list `lst` are accounted for in the returned lists. Therefore, the function meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
