Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as inputs. It then returns a tuple containing two lists:

1. The first list contains the elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`.
2. The second list contains the elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.

This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that the list should be split into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. The function uses list slicing (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) to achieve this, which is a standard and correct way to split a list in Python. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
