Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains the remaining elements. The slicing operations `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]` ensure that the entire list is accounted for in the returned tuples. The output hints also confirm that the function handles edge cases such as when `L` is `0` or equal to the length of the list, returning appropriate slices. While the hints mention that `L` being out of bounds may lead to unexpected results, the function itself still adheres to the problem description without causing errors for valid inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
