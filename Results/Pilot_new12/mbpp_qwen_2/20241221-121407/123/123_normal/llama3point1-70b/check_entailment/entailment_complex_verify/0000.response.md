Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly splits the given list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs, including edge cases like when `L` is 0 or equals the length of the list. Since the function handles these cases correctly and the annotations support this, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
