Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts based on the given integer `L` and returns them as a tuple. The function handles all potential cases as described:

- If `L` is `0`, the first returned list is empty, and the second list contains all elements of `lst`.
- If `L` equals `len(lst)`, the first list contains all elements of `lst`, and the second list is empty.
- If `L` is out of bounds (less than `0` or greater than `len(lst)`), the slicing operation will still execute but will result in either an empty list or no slicing at all, which is the expected behavior as per the problem description.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
