Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided program and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. This behavior is consistent across all potential inputs, including edge cases such as `L = 0` and `L = len(lst)`. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
