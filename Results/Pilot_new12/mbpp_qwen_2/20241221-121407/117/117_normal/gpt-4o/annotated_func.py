#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the sum of 1 for each integer element in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` containing various elements and returns the count of integer elements in the list. It achieves this by iterating through each element in the list and using a generator expression within the `sum` function to count how many times the condition `isinstance(x, int)` evaluates to `True`. The function does not handle any edge cases explicitly mentioned in the annotations, but it correctly sums up 1 for each integer found in the list. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code. The final state of the program is that it returns an integer representing the count of integer elements in the input list `lst`.
