Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through each element in the input list and counts how many of those elements are integers using a generator expression within the `sum` function. The assertions in the provided examples confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Since the code handles all potential cases of integer elements in a list and the problem description does not specify any additional edge cases or constraints, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
