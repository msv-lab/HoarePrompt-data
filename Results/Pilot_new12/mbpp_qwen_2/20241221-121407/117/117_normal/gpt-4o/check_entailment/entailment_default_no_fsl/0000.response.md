Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function `func_1` iterates over each element in the list and uses `isinstance(x, int)` to check if the element is an integer. It then returns the count of such elements using a generator expression within the `sum` function. Based on the problem description and the provided assertions, the function appears to work correctly for all potential cases. The output hints also confirm that the function handles the task as described without any explicit edge cases needing special handling. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
