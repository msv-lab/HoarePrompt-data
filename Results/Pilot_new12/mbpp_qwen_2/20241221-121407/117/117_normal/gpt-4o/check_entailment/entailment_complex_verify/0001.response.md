Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The annotations support this by explaining that the function iterates through each element in the list, using a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the number of elements that are instances of `int`. The assertions provided in the code verify that the function behaves as expected for lists containing mixed data types, purely integer lists, and lists with both integers and non-integers. Since the function logic is sound and the provided test cases confirm its correctness, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
