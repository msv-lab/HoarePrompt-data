Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns the count of integer elements in that list. This is achieved using a generator expression inside the `sum` function, which counts the number of elements in `lst` that are instances of the `int` class.

Here's a brief breakdown of why this implementation is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` iterates over each element in the input list `lst`.
2. **Condition Check**: For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is an instance of the `int` class using `isinstance(x, int)`.
3. **Counting Integers**: The `sum` function adds up the `True` values (which are treated as `1` in a numerical context) for all elements that are integers.
4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test different scenarios (mixed types, all integers, mixed numbers) and confirm that the function returns the expected number of integer elements.

Since the function correctly counts the number of integer elements in the list for any valid input, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
