Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The expression `sum((1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)))` generates a generator that yields 1 for each integer element in the list, and `sum` adds up these values to give the total count. The examples provided also validate the correctness of the function:

- `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` returns 2, which is correct since there are two integers (1 and 2).
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns 3, which is correct since all three elements are integers.
- `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` returns 2, which is correct since only the first and third elements (1 and 4) are integers.

Since the program works correctly for the given examples and there are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the function is correct.
