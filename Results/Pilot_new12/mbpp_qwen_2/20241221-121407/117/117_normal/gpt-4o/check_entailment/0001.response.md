Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over the list and count the elements that are instances of `int`. 

- The first assertion checks a list with mixed data types (integers, strings, and float) and correctly returns 2.
- The second assertion checks a list with only integers and correctly returns 3.
- The third assertion checks a list with both integers and floats and correctly returns 2.

Since the function works correctly for the provided test cases and the logic seems sound, it should handle other similar cases as well. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for counting integer elements in a list.
