Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to count the number of integer elements in a given list. The function iterates over each element in the list and uses the `isinstance()` function to check if the element is an integer. If the condition is met, it contributes 1 to the sum, which is then returned as the total count of integer elements. The function does not handle invalid inputs such as non-list inputs or edge cases like empty lists, but these are outside the scope of the problem description as per the given assumptions. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description and can be considered correct.
