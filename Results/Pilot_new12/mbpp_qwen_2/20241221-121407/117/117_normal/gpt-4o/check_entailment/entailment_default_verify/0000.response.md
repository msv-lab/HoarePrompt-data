Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The original assessment is accurate because the program iterates through the list, uses `isinstance(x, int)` to check if each element is an integer, and sums up the count of such elements. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct count of integer elements in the list. Since there are no issues or edge cases identified that would cause the function to fail under the assumption of valid input, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
