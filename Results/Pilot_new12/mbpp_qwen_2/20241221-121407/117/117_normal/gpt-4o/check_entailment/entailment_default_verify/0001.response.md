Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list, as evidenced by the assertions. The function uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over the list and count the elements that are instances of `int`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, counting integer elements in the list without any issues. Since the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the logic is sound, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
