Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integer elements in that list. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to evaluate `isinstance(x, int)` for each element `x` in the list. If `x` is an integer, `isinstance(x, int)` returns `True`, and if it is not, it returns `False`. Summing these boolean values effectively counts the number of integer elements in the list, as `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0` in the summation process.

Since the function processes every element in the list and correctly handles both integer and non-integer values, it meets the requirement of the problem description for any valid input list. Therefore, the program is correct.
