Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns the count of integer elements within the list. It achieves this by using a generator expression `(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` to evaluate whether each element `x` in the list is an instance of the `int` class. The `sum` function then counts the number of `True` values returned by the generator expression, which corresponds to the number of integer elements in the list.

Given the output hints, the function indeed counts the integer elements correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that would make the function incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
