Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses `sum` along with a generator expression `(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` to count the number of integer elements in the list. This approach is correct because `isinstance(x, int)` will return `True` for integer values and `False` otherwise. Summing these boolean values will effectively count the number of `True` values, which corresponds to the number of integer elements in the list. Since this logic covers all potential cases where the input list may contain any type of elements, the function will work correctly for any given list.
