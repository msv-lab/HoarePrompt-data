Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and returns the number of integer elements in the list. This is achieved by using a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the number of `True` values returned by `isinstance(x, int)` for each element `x` in the list `lst`.

- The `isinstance(x, int)` function checks if `x` is an instance of the `int` class. If `x` is an integer, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
- The generator expression `(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` iterates over each element in `lst`, checking if it is an integer and yielding `True` or `False` accordingly.
- The `sum` function then adds up all the `True` values (which are treated as `1`) and `False` values (which are treated as `0`), effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list.

Since the program accurately counts the number of integer elements in the given list, it correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
