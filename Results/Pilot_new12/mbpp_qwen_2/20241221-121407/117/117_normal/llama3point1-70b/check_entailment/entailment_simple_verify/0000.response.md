Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly uses a generator expression with `isinstance(x, int)` to iterate through each element in the list `lst`. The `sum` function then counts the number of times `isinstance(x, int)` evaluates to `True`, effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list. The annotated code aligns with the problem description and the original assessment, confirming that the function behaves as intended and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
