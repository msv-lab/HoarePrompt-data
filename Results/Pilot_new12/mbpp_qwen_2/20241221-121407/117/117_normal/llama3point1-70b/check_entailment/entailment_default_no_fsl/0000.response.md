Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression `(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` to evaluate whether each element in the list is an integer, resulting in a sequence of boolean values. The `sum` function then adds up these boolean values, treating `True` as 1 and `False` as 0, thus providing the count of integer elements. This approach works for all potential cases, including an empty list, which would result in a sum of 0, and lists containing non-integer elements, which would not contribute to the sum. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
