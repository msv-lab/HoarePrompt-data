Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the number of integer elements in the list. The generator expression `(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` evaluates to `True` for each integer in the list and `False` otherwise. Summing these boolean values counts the number of `True` values, which corresponds to the number of integer elements in the list. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly counts the integer elements by returning the sum of `True` values. Since the logic is sound and the annotations support the correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
