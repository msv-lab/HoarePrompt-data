Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list by using a generator expression with `isinstance(x, int)` inside the `sum` function. This approach iterates through each element in the list and sums up the truth values of whether each element is an instance of `int`. Since this method handles all potential cases where the list can contain any type of elements, and it accurately counts the integers, the function works correctly for every potential case described in the problem statement.
