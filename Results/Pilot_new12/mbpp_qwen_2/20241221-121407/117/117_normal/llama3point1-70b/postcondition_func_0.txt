The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements within the list. It achieves this by evaluating the expression `isinstance(x, int)` for each element `x` in the list `lst`, which results in a boolean value (`True` if `x` is an integer, `False` otherwise). The function then sums up all the `True` values, effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list. Potential edge cases include an empty list, where the function will return 0, and lists containing non-integer elements, which will contribute 0 to the sum.
