Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function `func_1` correctly handles the cases provided in the problem description and output hints. It returns the correct index for the first occurrence of the target number or `-1` if the target is not found. The binary search algorithm ensures that the function works efficiently even for larger arrays. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that the code is not handling based on the provided assertions and hints.
