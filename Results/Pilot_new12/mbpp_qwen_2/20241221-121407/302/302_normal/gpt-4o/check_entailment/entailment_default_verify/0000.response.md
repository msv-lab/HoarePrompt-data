Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The output hints confirm that the function sets the `result` to the index of the target if found, and returns `-1` if not found, which aligns with the problem description. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including multiple occurrences of the target number, the target appearing in the middle of the array, and the target appearing at the end. The binary search algorithm correctly narrows down the search range by updating the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` when a match is found, ensuring the first occurrence is identified. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
