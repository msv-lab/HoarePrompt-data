Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, the program does not correctly handle cases where the target number appears multiple times in the array. Specifically, the program returns the index of the first occurrence of the target number, but it does not ensure that this is the first occurrence if the target number appears multiple times. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
```
The expected output is `1`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `5`. However, if we consider the case where the target number is the last element in the array and appears multiple times, the program will return the index of the first occurrence instead of the last:

```
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 9) == 6
```
The expected output should be `8`, but the program returns `6`. This is because the program updates `result` as soon as it finds a match, without ensuring that it is the last occurrence of the target number.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee finding the last occurrence of the target number in the array.
