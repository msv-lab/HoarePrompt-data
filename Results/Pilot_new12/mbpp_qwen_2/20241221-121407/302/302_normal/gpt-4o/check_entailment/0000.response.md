Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program implements a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The assertions provided cover different scenarios:

1. Multiple occurrences of the target number (e.g., `[2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]`, `target = 5`).
2. Target number appearing in the middle of the array (e.g., `[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]`, `target = 5`).
3. Target number appearing towards the end of the array (e.g., `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]`, `target = 6`).

The binary search algorithm in the function correctly updates the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` when it finds a match, which helps in finding the first occurrence of the target number. Additionally, the function returns `-1` if the target is not found, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given these points, the program works correctly for all tested cases and the described behavior, making it correct.
