Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

2. **Function Definition**:
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order) and `target` (an integer).
   - It uses a binary search approach to find the first occurrence of the `target` in the `arr`.

3. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search is implemented correctly with the initial pointers `low` and `high` set to the start and end of the array, respectively.
   - During each iteration, the middle element (`mid`) is calculated, and the following steps are taken:
     - If the middle element matches the `target`, the `result` is updated to `mid`, and the search continues in the left half by setting `high = mid - 1`.
     - If the middle element is less than the `target`, the search continues in the right half by setting `low = mid + 1`.
     - If the middle element is greater than the `target`, the search continues in the left half by setting `high = mid - 1`.

4. **Termination Condition**:
   - The loop terminates when `low > high`, indicating that the `target` was not found in the array. In this case, the function returns `-1`.

5. **Correctness**:
   - The program ensures that the first occurrence of the `target` is found. If the `target` is present multiple times, the function returns the index of the first occurrence.
   - The program handles all possible cases within the constraints provided (i.e., valid inputs).

Given the above points, the program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
