Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides clear states and logic flow, supporting the correctness of the program. Here’s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial State**: The input `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target` is an integer.
2. **Loop Execution**: The binary search algorithm iterates until `low` exceeds `high`. During each iteration:
   - If `arr[mid] == target`, the `result` is set to `mid`, and the `high` is adjusted to `mid - 1` to continue searching for earlier occurrences.
   - If `arr[mid] < target`, the `low` is updated to `mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
3. **Final State**: After the loop, if the target is found, `result` contains the index of the first occurrence. If not, `result` remains `-1`.

The annotations confirm that the function correctly implements a binary search to find the first occurrence of the target in a sorted array. The provided assertions cover various scenarios and validate the function’s behavior. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is accurate.
