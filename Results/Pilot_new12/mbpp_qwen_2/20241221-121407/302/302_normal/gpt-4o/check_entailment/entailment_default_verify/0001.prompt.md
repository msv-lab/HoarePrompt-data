You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program uses binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, the program does not correctly handle cases where the target number appears multiple times in the array. Specifically, the program returns the index of the first occurrence of the target number, but it does not ensure that this is the first occurrence if the target number appears multiple times. 

For example, consider the following input:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
```
The expected output is `1`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `5`. However, if we consider the case where the target number is the last element in the array and appears multiple times, the program will return the index of the first occurrence instead of the last:

```
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 9) == 6
```
The expected output should be `8`, but the program returns `6`. This is because the program updates `result` as soon as it finds a match, without ensuring that it is the last occurrence of the target number.

Therefore, the program is incorrect because it does not guarantee finding the last occurrence of the target number in the array.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the `target` within the list. If the `target` is found, it sets the `result` to the index of the `target` in `arr` and returns this index. If the `target` is not found and the condition `low > high` is met, the function returns `-1`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `result` holds either the index of the `target` if it was found, or `-1` if the `target` was not found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
