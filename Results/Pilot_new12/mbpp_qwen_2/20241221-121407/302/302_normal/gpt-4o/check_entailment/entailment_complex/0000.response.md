Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a sorted list `arr` and an integer `target` as inputs and performs a binary search to find the first occurrence of `target` in `arr`. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
2. **Functionality**: The function uses a binary search approach, which is efficient for searching in a sorted array.
3. **Initialization**: The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to the start and end indices of the array, respectively.
4. **Search Loop**: The loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, meaning the target is not found or the target is found at the current midpoint.
   - If the middle element (`arr[mid]`) equals the target, the function updates `result` to the current index `mid` and narrows the search to the left half by setting `high = mid - 1` to ensure the first occurrence is found.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than the target, the search range is narrowed to the right half by setting `low = mid + 1`.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than the target, the search range is narrowed to the left half by setting `high = mid - 1`.
5. **Return Statement**: The function returns `result`, which will be the index of the first occurrence of the target if found, or `-1` if the target is not found.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the requirement to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
