Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the behavior and states of the program during its execution. It confirms that the function `func_1` correctly performs a binary search to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotations indicate that if the target is found, the function sets `result` to the appropriate index; otherwise, it returns `-1`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description and the provided assertions. The function handles multiple scenarios effectively, ensuring that the first occurrence is found or `-1` is returned if the target is not present. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
