Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the `target` is the largest element in the array. Specifically, the condition `high = mid - 1` in the binary search loop can lead to missing the last occurrence of the target if it is at the last index of the list. For example, consider the case `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 9)`. The function will correctly find the first occurrence of 9 at index 7, but it will not update the `result` if the loop exits due to `low > high`. Therefore, the function will return -1 instead of 8, which is the index of the first occurrence of 9. This violates the problem description, which requires finding the index of the first occurrence of the target number.
