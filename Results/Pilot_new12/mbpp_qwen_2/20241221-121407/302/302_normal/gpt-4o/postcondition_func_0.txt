The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the `target` within the list. If the `target` is found, it sets the `result` to the index of the `target` in `arr` and returns this index. If the `target` is not found and the condition `low > high` is met, the function returns `-1`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `result` holds either the index of the `target` if it was found, or `-1` if the `target` was not found.
