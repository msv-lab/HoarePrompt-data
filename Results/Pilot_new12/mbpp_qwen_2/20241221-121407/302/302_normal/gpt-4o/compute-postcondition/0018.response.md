The code `low = mid + 1` changes the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `low` and `high` were previously set such that `low <= high`.

Let's denote the current values:
- `low` was initially set to some value, let's call it `L`.
- `high` was initially set to some value, let's call it `H`.
- `mid` is calculated as `(L + H) // 2`.

After executing `low = mid + 1`, the new value of `low` becomes `(L + H) // 2 + 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged:
- `high` remains `H`.
- `target` remains its original value.
- `result` remains its original value.
- `mid` is no longer needed as it has been updated.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`low` is `(L + H) // 2 + 1`, `high` is `H`, `target` is the original value, `result` is the original value, `mid` is no longer defined.**
