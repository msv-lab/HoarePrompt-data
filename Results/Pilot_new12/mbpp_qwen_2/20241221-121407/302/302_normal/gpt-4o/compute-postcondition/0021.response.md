Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers such that `low <= high`, `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid] == target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid] < target`, then `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. If `arr[mid] >= target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.***
