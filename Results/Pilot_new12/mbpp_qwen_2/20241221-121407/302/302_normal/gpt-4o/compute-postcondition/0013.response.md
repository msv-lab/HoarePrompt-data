Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers, `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1, `mid` is an integer. If `arr[mid] == target`, `result` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid] < target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`; if `arr[mid] > target`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. If the target is found, `result` is set to the appropriate index; if not found, `result` remains -1.***
