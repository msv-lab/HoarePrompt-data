Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is an integer, `high` is an integer, `result` is either the index of the target in `arr` or -1, `mid` is an integer. If `arr[mid] < target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Otherwise, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. If the target is found, `result` is set to the appropriate index. If the target is not found, `result` remains -1.**
