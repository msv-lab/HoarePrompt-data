Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers such that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1, `mid` is updated to `(low + high) // 2`. If `arr[mid] < target`, then `low` is updated to `(low + mid + 1) // 2`. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `(low + mid - 1) // 2`.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both cases where the condition `arr[mid] < target` is true and false.
