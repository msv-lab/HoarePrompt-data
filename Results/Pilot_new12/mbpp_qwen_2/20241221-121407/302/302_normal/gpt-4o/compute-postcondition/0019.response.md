The variable `high` is reassigned the value `mid - 1`. The initial values of `low`, `mid`, and `high` are such that `low <= high`. The value of `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. After executing `high = mid - 1`, the value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is unchanged, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is `mid - 1`, `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1**
