The code assigns the value of `mid` to `result`. The value of `mid` is \((\text{low} + \text{high}) // 2\). The states of the other variables (`arr`, `target`, `low`, `high`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers such that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is equal to \((\text{low} + \text{high}) // 2\), `mid` is equal to \((\text{low} + \text{high}) // 2\)**
