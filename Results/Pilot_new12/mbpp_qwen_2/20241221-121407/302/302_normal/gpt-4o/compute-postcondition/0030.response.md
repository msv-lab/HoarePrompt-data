Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers such that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1, `mid` is an integer. If the target is found, `result` is set to the appropriate index; if not found, `result` remains -1. After all iterations, `low` will be greater than `high`.**
