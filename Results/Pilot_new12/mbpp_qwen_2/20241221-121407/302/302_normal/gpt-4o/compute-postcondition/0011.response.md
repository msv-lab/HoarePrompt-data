The variable `high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` and initially `low` is 0 and `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, the value of `mid` is greater than or equal to `target`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `mid - 1`, `result` is -1, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` and `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`**
