The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, setting `low` to 0 and `high` to the length of the list `arr` minus one. The initial state of `arr` being a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and `target` being an integer remains unchanged.

Output State: **arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, target is an integer, low is 0, high is len(arr) - 1**
