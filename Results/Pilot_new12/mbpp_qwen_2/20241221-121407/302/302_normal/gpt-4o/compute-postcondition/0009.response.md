`low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Given the initial conditions, `mid` satisfies `arr[mid] < target`, and `low` is initially 0 while `high` is `len(arr) - 1`. Since `arr[mid] < target`, setting `low` to `mid + 1` means `low` will now be `low + 1` which is `0 + 1 = 1`.

The other variables (`high`, `result`, `mid`, `arr`, and `target`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 1, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1, `result` is -1, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`, and the current value of `mid` satisfies `arr[mid] < target`**
