Let's analyze the given state and the `while` loop step by step.

### Given State
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is `len(arr) - 1`.
- `result` is -1 (indicating that the target has not been found yet).

### Loop Condition
The loop condition is `while low <= high:`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Initial Values**: 
   - `low` starts at 0.
   - `high` starts at `len(arr) - 1`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `low <= high` must be true.
   - Since `low` is initially 0 and `high` is initially `len(arr) - 1`, the condition `low <= high` is true as long as there are elements between `low` and `high`.

3. **No Adjustment Needed**:
   - The current values of `low` and `high` (0 and `len(arr) - 1` respectively) satisfy the loop condition.
   - There are no specific constraints on the values of `arr`, `target`, or `result` that would prevent the loop from executing at least once.

Since the loop can certainly execute at least one time with the given initial conditions, no state adjustments are necessary.

### Final Answer
State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1, `result` is -1**
