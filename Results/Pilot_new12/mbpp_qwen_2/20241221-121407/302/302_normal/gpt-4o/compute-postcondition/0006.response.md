The code `high = mid - 1` assigns the value of `mid - 1` to the variable `high`. Since `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` and is equal to the index where `target` is found in the list `arr`, the value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. All other variables retain their original values. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `mid - 1`, `result` is `mid`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
