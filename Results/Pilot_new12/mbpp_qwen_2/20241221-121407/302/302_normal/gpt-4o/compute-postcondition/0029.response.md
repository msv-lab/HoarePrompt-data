Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers such that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1, `mid` is updated to either `(\text{low} + \text{high}) // 2` (if `arr[mid] == target`) or remains unchanged (if `arr[mid] != target`).***

This postcondition covers both the cases where the target is found (`arr[mid] == target`) and where it is not found (`arr[mid] != target`). In the first case, `result` is set to `mid`, and in the second case, `low` and `high` are updated accordingly, and `result` remains `-1` if the target is not found.
