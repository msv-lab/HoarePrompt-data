The value of `high` is set to `mid - 1`. The previous value of `high` was `(low + high) // 2`, so now it is updated to `(low + (low + high) // 2 - 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers such that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is updated to `(low + (low + high) // 2 - 1) // 2**
