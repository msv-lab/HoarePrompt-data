The variable `result` is assigned the value `-1`. This means that the search for the `target` in the list `arr` has not found a match, and `result` is set to indicate this absence. The other variables (`arr`, `target`, `low`, and `high`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1, `result` is -1**
