The code assigns the value of `(low + high) // 2` to the variable `mid`. This does not affect the values of `arr`, `target`, `low`, `high`, or `result`. Therefore, the updated state is that `mid` is now equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers such that `low <= high`, `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
