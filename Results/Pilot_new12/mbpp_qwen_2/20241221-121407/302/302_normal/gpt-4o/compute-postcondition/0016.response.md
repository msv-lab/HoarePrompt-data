The code assigns the value of `mid` to `result`. Since `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, `result` now holds this value. The other variables (`arr`, `target`, `low`, `high`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers such that `low <= high`, `result` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers such that `low <= high`, `result` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
