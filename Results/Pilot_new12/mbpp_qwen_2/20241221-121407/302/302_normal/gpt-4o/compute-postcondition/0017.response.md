The variable `high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. The previous value of `mid` was `(low + high) // 2`, so now `high` is updated to `(low + (low + high) // 2) // 2 - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is unchanged, `high` is equal to `(low + (low + high) // 2) // 2 - 1`, `result` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
