The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `low` was `(low + high) // 2`, so now `low` is set to this value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `high` is an integer such that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2, `low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1**
