Let's analyze the given `while` loop and the current state step by step to determine what adjustments are needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `target` is an integer.
   - `low` and `high` are integers such that `low <= high`.
   - `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1.
   - `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

3. **Loop Body Adjustments:**
   - If `arr[mid] == target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - If `arr[mid] < target`, then `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.
   - If `arr[mid] >= target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.

### Conditions for the Loop to Execute One More Time:

For the loop to continue executing one more time, the condition `low <= high` must still hold true after the updates to `low` and `high`.

Let's consider each case in the loop body:

1. **Case 1: `arr[mid] == target`**
   - `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `low <= (mid - 1)` must hold true, but this means `low` should not exceed `mid - 1`.

2. **Case 2: `arr[mid] < target`**
   - `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `(low + high) // 2 + 1 <= high` must hold true. This implies `low` should not be too large relative to `high`.

3. **Case 3: `arr[mid] >= target`**
   - `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, `low <= (mid - 1)` must hold true, but this means `low` should not exceed `mid - 1`.

Given these cases, we need to ensure that the updated values of `low` and `high` still satisfy `low <= high`.

### Final State Adjustment:

To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `low` and `high` remain within the bounds required for the loop condition to hold true. Specifically, we need to ensure that `low` is not more than `high`.

Therefore, the state adjustment would be:

**State: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers such that `low <= high`, `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high` for the loop to execute one more time.**

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` and `high` are integers such that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `result` is the index of the target in `arr` if found, otherwise -1, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
