The code assigns the value of `mid` to `result`. Given the initial conditions, `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and since `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, the value of `mid` remains unchanged. Thus, `result` is now also equal to `mid`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1, `result` is `mid`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, and the current value of `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, `result` is `mid`.**
