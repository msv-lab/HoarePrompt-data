The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target`, which is an integer. If the target is not found in the list and the condition `low > high` is met, the function returns `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`, and return `-1` if the target is not found in the list under the condition that `low > high`.
