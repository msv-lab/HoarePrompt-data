The code assigns the value of `(low + high) // 2` to the variable `mid`. This calculation does not affect the values of `arr`, `target`, `low`, `high`, or `result`. The value of `mid` is now set based on the current values of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is len(`arr`) - 1, `result` is -1, `mid` is (low + high) // 2**
