Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the `target` within the list. If the `target` is found, it sets the `result` to the index of the `target` in `arr` and returns this index. If the `target` is not found and the condition `low > high` is met, the function returns `-1`. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `result` holds either the index of the `target` if it was found, or `-1` if the `target` was not found.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list `arr` is empty, the initial values of `low` and `high` would be `0` and `-1` respectively, leading to `low > high` immediately, thus returning `-1`.
- If the `target` is less than the smallest element in the list (`arr[0]`), the binary search will conclude without finding the `target`, and return `-1`.
- If the `target` is greater than the largest element in the list (`arr[-1]`), the binary search will conclude without finding the `target`, and return `-1`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code does not handle the case where `arr` contains duplicate elements and the `target` appears multiple times. In such cases, the code will only return the index of the first occurrence of the `target`. To handle duplicates, additional logic would need to be added to ensure that the correct index is returned when the `target` is found more than once.
