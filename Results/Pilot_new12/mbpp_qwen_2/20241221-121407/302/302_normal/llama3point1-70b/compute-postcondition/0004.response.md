According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1.
- `x` must be set to the next element in the list.

Since `i` is currently 0, after incrementing `i` by 1, `i` becomes 1. Therefore, `x` will now be the second element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`**
