According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the list `arr`. The loop iterates through each element in `arr` using `enumerate`, where `i` is the index and `x` is the element at that index.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `i` is 1, meaning the loop has already checked the first two elements of `arr`.
- `x` is the second element of `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(arr)` must be true. Since `i` is currently 1, for the loop to proceed to the next iteration, `i` must be incremented to 2, and `x` will be the third element of `arr`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be incremented to 2.
- `x` will be the third element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element of `arr`.**
