State before the loop starts: `arr` is a list of integers that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num` is an integer.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop is iterating over the list `arr` using `enumerate`, which means it will assign each element of `arr` to `x` and its index to `i`.
2. For the loop to start executing, `arr` must contain at least one element because `enumerate` will fail if the list is empty.
3. The initial value of `i` should be 0, as `enumerate` starts indexing from 0.
4. The initial value of `x` will be the first element of `arr`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the following states:
- Ensure `arr` is not empty.
- Set `i` to 0.
- Set `x` to the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `arr`**
