Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is the index of the last iteration, `x` is the last element of `arr` checked, and if `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index where `num` is found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `None`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num` is an integer.
- **Loop Execution**:
  - The loop iterates over each element in `arr` using `enumerate`, assigning the index `i` and the value `x` to `num`.
  - If `x` equals `num`, the function returns `i`.
  - If `x` does not equal `num`, the loop continues to the next element.
- **Final Iteration**:
  - After the loop completes, if `num` was found in `arr`, the function would have returned the index where `num` is located.
  - If `num` was not found, the function does not return anything and implicitly returns `None`.

Since the loop stops either when it finds `num` or exhausts the list `arr`, the final state depends on whether `num` was found or not. If `num` was found, `i` will be the index where `num` is found, and `x` will be `num`. If `num` was not found, `i` will be the length of `arr`, and `x` will be the last element of `arr`. However, since the function returns immediately upon finding `num`, the final values of `i` and `x` will not be affected unless `num` is found.
