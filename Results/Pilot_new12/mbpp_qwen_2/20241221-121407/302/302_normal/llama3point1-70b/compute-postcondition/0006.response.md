Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element of `arr`. If `x` is equal to `num`, the function returns 1. Since there is no else part, the function does not change the value of `i` or `x` if `x` is not equal to `num`.***
