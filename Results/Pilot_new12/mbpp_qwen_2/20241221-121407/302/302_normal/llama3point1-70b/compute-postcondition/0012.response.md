The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num`, which is an integer. 

Based on the output cases provided:

- Case_1: The program returns 0
- Case_2: The program returns 1
- Case_3: The program returns 2
- Case_4: The program returns None

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`, and return either 0, 1, 2, or None based on certain conditions that are not specified here.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`, and returns either 0, 1, 2, or None.**
