Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotated version of the code supports this by stating that if the target number is found during the iteration, the function returns the index immediately. If the loop completes without finding the target number, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the number is not present in the array. This behavior aligns with the problem description and the provided annotations, thus maintaining the original assessment of correctness.
