Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array and returns `-1` if the number is not found. However, based on the annotated version and the actual implementation, the function does not return `-1` when the number is not found; instead, it returns `None`. The problem description specifies that the function should return the index of the first occurrence of the given number or `-1` if the number is not found. Since the function returns `None` instead of `-1` when the number is not found, it does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment needs to be revised.
