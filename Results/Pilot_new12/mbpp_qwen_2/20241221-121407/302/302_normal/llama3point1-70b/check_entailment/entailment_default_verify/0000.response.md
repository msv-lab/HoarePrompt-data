Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the original assessment correctly identifies that the program implements the functionality to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, the output hints reveal that the function actually returns `None` when the number is not found, rather than `-1`. The problem description explicitly states that the function should return `-1` if the given number is not found in the array. Since the current implementation does not adhere to this requirement, the original assessment needs to be revised. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
