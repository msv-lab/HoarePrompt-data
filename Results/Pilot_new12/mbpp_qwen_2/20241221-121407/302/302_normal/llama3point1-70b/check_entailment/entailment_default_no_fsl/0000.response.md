Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns `None` when the number `num` is not found in the array `arr`. However, the problem description asks to return the index of the first occurrence of the given number, which should be an integer index, not `None`. Since the function returns `None` instead of `-1` (or any other appropriate integer index) when the number is not found, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
