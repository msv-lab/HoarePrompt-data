Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(arr, num)` iterates through each element of the sorted array `arr` using a `for` loop with `enumerate`. For each element, it checks if the element matches the given number `num`. If a match is found, it immediately returns the index of that element. If no match is found after checking all elements, the function returns `-1`.

The program strictly follows the requirements of the problem description. It searches for the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array and returns its index if found. If the number is not found, it returns `-1`. The program handles all potential cases as described:

1. The function processes a non-empty list of integers that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. It correctly identifies the first occurrence of the target number and returns its index.
3. If the number is not present in the array, it returns `-1`.

Since the program meets all the criteria specified in the problem description without any exceptions, the correctness is **True**.
