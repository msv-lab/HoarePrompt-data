Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function correctly iterates through the sorted array using `enumerate` and returns the index of the first occurrence of the given number. If the number is not found, it returns -1. The annotations specify that the function returns `None`, but since the program logic dictates it should return -1, the annotation seems to contain an error. However, the core functionality described in the original assessment is correct: the function finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array and handles cases where the number is not present by returning -1. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains valid.
