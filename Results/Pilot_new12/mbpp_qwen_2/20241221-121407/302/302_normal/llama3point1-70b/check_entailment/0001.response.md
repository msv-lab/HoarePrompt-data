Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value, and returns the index as soon as it finds the first occurrence of the target number. If the target number is not found, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, including when the number is not present in the array.
