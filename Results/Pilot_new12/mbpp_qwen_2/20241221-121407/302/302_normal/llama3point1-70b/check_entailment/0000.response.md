Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and the value, and returns the index immediately once the target number is found. If the loop completes without finding the target, it returns -1, which aligns with the requirement. This approach ensures that the function works for all potential cases, including edge cases like an empty array or when the target number is not present in the array.
