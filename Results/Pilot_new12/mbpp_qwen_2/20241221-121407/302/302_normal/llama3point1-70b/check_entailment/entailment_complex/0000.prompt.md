You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is the index of the last iteration, `x` is the last element of `arr` checked, and if `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index where `num` is found. If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `None`.
    return -1
    #The program returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` within `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found, otherwise it returns `None`. Specifically:
- The function iterates through the list `arr` using a for loop.
- For each element `x` in `arr`, it checks if `x` equals `num`.
- If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index `i` where the match occurred.
- If no match is found after checking all elements in `arr`, the function returns `None`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `arr` is empty, the function will return `None` without entering the loop, which is correctly covered by the provided annotations.
- The function correctly handles the case where `num` is not found in `arr` by returning `None`.
- The function does not handle the specific return values 0, 1, or 2 mentioned in the return postconditions; these values are not reflected in the actual code logic. Therefore, the function can only return `None` when `num` is not found, or the index of `num` when it is found.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
