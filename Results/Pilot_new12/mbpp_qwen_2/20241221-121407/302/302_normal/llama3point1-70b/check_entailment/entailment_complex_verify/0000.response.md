Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program meets the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The annotated version supports this by indicating that the function iterates through the array, returns the index immediately upon finding the target number, and returns `-1` if the target is not found. The annotations also cover potential edge cases such as an empty array, which is handled appropriately by returning `-1`. The function correctly implements the required functionality and there are no issues or inaccuracies in the provided code based on the problem description and the annotated version.
