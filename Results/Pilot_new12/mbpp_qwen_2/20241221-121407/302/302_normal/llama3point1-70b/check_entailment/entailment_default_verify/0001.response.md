Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, based on the output hints, the function actually returns `None` if the target number is not found, instead of the expected `-1`. This discrepancy means that the function does not fully meet the problem description, which explicitly states that the function should return the index of the first occurrence of the given number or `-1` if the number is not found. Therefore, the original assessment needs to be revised to reflect this inaccuracy.
