Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not meet the problem description for every potential case. According to the problem description, the function should find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array and return that index. However, the code returns `None` if the number is not found in the array, which is not aligned with the problem description. The problem description specifies that the function should return the index of the first occurrence of the number if found, and `-1` if the number is not found. Since the code returns `None` instead of `-1` when the number is not found, it does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases.
