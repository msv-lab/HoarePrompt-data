The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` within `arr` and returns the index of `num` if found, otherwise it returns `None`. Specifically:
- The function iterates through the list `arr` using a for loop.
- For each element `x` in `arr`, it checks if `x` equals `num`.
- If a match is found, the function immediately returns the index `i` where the match occurred.
- If no match is found after checking all elements in `arr`, the function returns `None`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `arr` is empty, the function will return `None` without entering the loop, which is correctly covered by the provided annotations.
- The function correctly handles the case where `num` is not found in `arr` by returning `None`.
- The function does not handle the specific return values 0, 1, or 2 mentioned in the return postconditions; these values are not reflected in the actual code logic. Therefore, the function can only return `None` when `num` is not found, or the index of `num` when it is found.
