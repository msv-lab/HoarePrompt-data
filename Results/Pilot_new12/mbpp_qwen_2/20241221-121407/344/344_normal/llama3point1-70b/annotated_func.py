#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer or float.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`, or `len(sorted_list)` if no such element exists.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of the list 'sorted_list'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a sorted list of integers or floats (`sorted_list`) and a value (also an integer or float), and returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`. If no such element exists, it returns the length of the list. The possible return values are 0, 1, 2, or the length of the list. This function assumes that `sorted_list` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
