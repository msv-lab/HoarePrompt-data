You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. For any given value, the function iterates through the list and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which is correct behavior. Since the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer or float.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`, or `len(sorted_list)` if no such element exists.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of the list 'sorted_list'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a sorted list of integers or floats (`sorted_list`) and a value (also an integer or float), and returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`. If no such element exists, it returns the length of the list. The possible return values are 0, 1, 2, or the length of the list. This function assumes that `sorted_list` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
