Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the list and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which is correct behavior. The output hints also confirm that the function returns the appropriate index or the length of the list, assuming the input list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
