Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. For any given value, the function iterates through the list and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which is correct behavior. Since the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, it is considered correct.
