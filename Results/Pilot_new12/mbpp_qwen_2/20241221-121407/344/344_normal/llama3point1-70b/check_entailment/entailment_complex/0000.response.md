Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value, and returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element exists, it returns the length of the list.

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization and Loop**: The function iterates through the elements of `sorted_list` using a `for` loop. It checks each element to see if it is greater than or equal to the specified `value`.

2. **Condition Check**: When the condition `sorted_list[i] >= value` is met, the function immediately returns the current index `i`.

3. **Completion of Loop**: If the loop completes without finding an element that satisfies the condition, the function returns the length of the list. This covers the case where all elements in the list are less than the specified value.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If the list is empty and the value is greater than all elements (which cannot happen because the list is empty), the function still handles this correctly by returning 0.
   - If the list contains only elements less than the value, the function correctly returns the length of the list.

Since the function behaves as described in the problem statement for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
