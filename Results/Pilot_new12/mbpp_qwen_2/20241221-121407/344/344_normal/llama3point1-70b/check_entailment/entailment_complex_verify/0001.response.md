Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function iterates through the list and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which is the correct behavior. The annotations support that the function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
