Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the list and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element exists, it returns the length of the list. Given the problem description and the output hints, the function handles all described cases correctly. For instance:
- If the value is less than all elements in the list, it returns 0.
- If the value is greater than all elements, it returns the length of the list.
- If the value matches an element in the list, it returns the index of that element.
- If the value is between two elements, it returns the index of the next element.

Since the function behaves as expected for all mentioned cases, the program is correct.
