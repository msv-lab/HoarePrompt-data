Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for finding the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function iterates through the list and returns the index where the value would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which is correct. This implementation handles all potential cases as per the problem description, as indicated by the annotations. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
