Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for finding the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the list and returns the index where the value would be inserted to maintain sorted order. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which is correct. This implementation handles all potential cases as per the problem description.
