Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` implements the logic for finding the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The provided output hints further confirm that the function returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`, and if no such element exists, it returns the length of the list. This behavior aligns with the problem description and the expected functionality as summarized in the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
