Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program implements a function that correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Here's why the program is correct according to the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should find the position to insert a given value into a sorted list so that the list remains sorted.
2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function iterates through each element in the `sorted_list` using a `for` loop.
   - For each element, it checks if the current element (`sorted_list[i]`) is greater than or equal to the specified `value`.
   - If it finds such an element, it immediately returns the index `i`.
   - If no element in the list is greater than or equal to the `value`, the function returns the length of the list (`len(sorted_list)`).

This logic ensures that the returned index `i` is the correct position to insert the `value` while maintaining the sorted order of the list. If the `value` is less than all elements in the list, `len(sorted_list)` will be returned, indicating the position just beyond the last element.

Given this, the program always satisfies the requirement of finding the correct insertion point for the specified value in the sorted list. Therefore, the program is correct.
