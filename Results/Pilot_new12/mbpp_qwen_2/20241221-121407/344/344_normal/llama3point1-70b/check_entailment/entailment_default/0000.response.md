Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function iterates through the list and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to the specified value. If no such element exists, it returns the length of the list. This behavior matches the problem description and the output hints, which state that the function should return the index of the first element greater than or equal to the value, or the length of the list if no such element exists. The code handles all potential cases correctly, including when the value is at the end of the list or when the list is empty.
