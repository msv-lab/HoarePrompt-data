Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats with at least one element, `i` is 1, and the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`. If `sorted_list[i]` (which is the first element of `sorted_list`) is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (returns None).***
