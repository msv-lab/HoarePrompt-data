Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats with at least one element.
   - `value` is an integer or float.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for each index from 0 to `len(sorted_list) - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0.

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

4. **Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should still be less than `len(sorted_list)`.

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is now 1, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `len(sorted_list)` for the loop to continue.
   - `sorted_list` still has at least one element, so its length is at least 1.
   - The first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`, which remains unchanged.

Based on the above steps, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats with at least one element, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is 1, and the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`.**

So, the final answer is:
State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats with at least one element, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is 1, and the first element of `sorted_list` is less than `value`**
