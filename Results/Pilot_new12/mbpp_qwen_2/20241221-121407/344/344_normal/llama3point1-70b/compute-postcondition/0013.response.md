Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a sorted list of integers or floats (`sorted_list`) and a value (also an integer or float), and returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`. If no such element exists, it returns the length of the list. The possible return values are 0, 1, 2, or the length of the list. This function assumes that `sorted_list` is already sorted in non-decreasing order.**

Edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `sorted_list` is empty, the function will return 0, which is consistent with the behavior of returning the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
- The function correctly handles the case where the value is less than the first element in `sorted_list` by returning 0.
- The function correctly handles the case where the value is greater than or equal to the last element in `sorted_list` by returning the length of the list.
- The function correctly handles the case where the value matches the first element in `sorted_list` by returning 0.
- The function correctly handles the case where the value matches the second element in `sorted_list` by returning 1.

In summary, the function finds the correct position for `value` in the sorted list and returns the corresponding index.
