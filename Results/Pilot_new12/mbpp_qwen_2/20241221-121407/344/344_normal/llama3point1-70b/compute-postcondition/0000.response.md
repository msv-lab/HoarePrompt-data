State before the loop starts: `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value` is an integer or float.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 until `i` is less than `len(sorted_list)`.
2. For the loop to execute, `sorted_list` must have at least one element. If `sorted_list` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. The initial value of `i` should be set to 0 since the loop starts iterating from the first index.

Therefore, we need to adjust the following states:
- Ensure `sorted_list` has at least one element.
- Set `i` to 0.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that must have at least one element, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is 0**
