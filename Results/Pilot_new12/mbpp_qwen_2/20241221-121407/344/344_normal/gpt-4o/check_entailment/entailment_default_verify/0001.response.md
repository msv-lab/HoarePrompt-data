Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which is designed to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function `func_1` correctly implements this functionality as evidenced by the assertions provided. The output hints confirm that the function handles the case where the value is greater than all elements in the list by returning the length of the list, which aligns with the expected behavior of `bisect.bisect_right`. Since the program passes all the provided test cases and the behavior matches the problem description and expected functionality, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
