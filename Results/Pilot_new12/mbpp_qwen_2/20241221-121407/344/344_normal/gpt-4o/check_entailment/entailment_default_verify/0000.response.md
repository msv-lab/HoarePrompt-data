Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers or floats and a value, and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order. The examples provided in the assertions cover different scenarios and the function handles them correctly. There are no apparent edge cases or errors in the provided code that would contradict the original assessment. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the provided output hints.
