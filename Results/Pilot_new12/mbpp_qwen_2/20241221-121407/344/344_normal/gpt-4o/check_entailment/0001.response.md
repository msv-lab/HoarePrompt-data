Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which is designed to find the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list such that the order is maintained. The function `func_1` correctly returns the right insertion point for the given value in the sorted list for all the test cases provided. Since the behavior of `bisect.bisect_right` is well-defined and matches the problem description, and the function passes all the provided test cases without any issues, the program is correct. There are no edge cases or additional inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the standard behavior of the `bisect` module.
