Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version supports the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The examples provided in the assertions cover different scenarios and are handled correctly:

- When the value `6` is inserted, it should be placed at the end of the list, so the return value is `4`.
- When the value `3` is inserted, it should be placed at index `2` to maintain the sorted order.
- When the value `7` is inserted, it should also be placed at the end of the list, so the return value is `4`.

The annotations clarify that the function `func_1` accepts a sorted list and a value, and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order. The function handles the case where the value is greater than all elements in the list by returning the length of the list, which is consistent with the behavior of `bisect.bisect_right`.

Given that the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
