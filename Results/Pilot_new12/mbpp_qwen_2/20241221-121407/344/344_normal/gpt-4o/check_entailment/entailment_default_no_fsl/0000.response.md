Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code uses `bisect.bisect_right()` from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to return the appropriate index for the given value. The provided assertions cover different scenarios, including when the value is greater than all elements in the list, and the function behaves as expected. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or hints that the code is not handling, so the code appears to meet the requirements for every potential case.
