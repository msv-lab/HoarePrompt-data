Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function uses the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module, which returns the insertion point for the specified value in the list to maintain the sorted order. 

- When the value is greater than all elements in the list (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`), `bisect.bisect_right` returns the length of the list, which is the correct position to insert the value.
- When the value fits between two elements in the list (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`), `bisect.bisect_right` returns the index after the last element that is less than the value, ensuring the list remains sorted if the value is inserted at that index.
- When the value is greater than all elements in the list (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`), again, `bisect.bisect_right` returns the length of the list, indicating the correct position for insertion.

The function does not need to handle additional edge cases beyond those already covered by the `bisect` module, as per the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
