Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. This is exactly what the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module does. 

- `bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)` returns the index where the `value` should be inserted in `sorted_list` to maintain the list's sorted order. This matches the problem description perfectly.
- The function takes two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, which is also an integer or float.
- The provided assertions test different scenarios:
  - When the `value` (6) is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list (`4`).
  - When the `value` (3) is between the second and third elements, it returns the index after the second element (`2`).
  - When the `value` (7) is greater than the last element, it returns the length of the list (`4`).

Since the function implementation aligns with the problem description and the provided test cases confirm its correctness, the program is correct.
