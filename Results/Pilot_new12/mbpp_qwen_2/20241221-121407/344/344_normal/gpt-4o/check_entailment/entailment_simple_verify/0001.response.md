Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function, which is designed to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list while maintaining the order. The function `func_1` correctly implements this functionality as evidenced by the provided assertions. The annotated version confirms that the input list is sorted and the value to be inserted is a valid integer or float, aligning with the expected inputs for the `bisect.bisect_right` function. Since the function passes all the provided test cases and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
