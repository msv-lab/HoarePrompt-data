Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version supports this assessment by clearly explaining that the function `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right` to find the correct insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function correctly returns the expected indices for the given test cases, and the annotations confirm that the function behaves as intended. There are no edge cases or issues with the provided input that would cause the function to fail, and the annotations align with the behavior of the `bisect` module. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
