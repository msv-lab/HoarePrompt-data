Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. This function returns the insertion point for `value` in `sorted_list` to maintain sorted order. The examples given in the assertions cover different scenarios:

- When the value `6` is inserted, it should be placed at the end of the list, so the return value is `4`.
- When the value `3` is inserted, it should be placed at index `2` to maintain the sorted order.
- When the value `7` is inserted, it should also be placed at the end of the list, so the return value is `4`.

The program handles these cases correctly according to the problem description, and there are no apparent edge cases or errors in the provided code. Therefore, the program is correct.
