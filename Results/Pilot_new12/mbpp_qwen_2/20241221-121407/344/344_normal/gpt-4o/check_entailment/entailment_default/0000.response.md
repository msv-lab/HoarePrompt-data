Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` uses the `bisect.bisect_right()` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order. Based on the problem description, the function needs to correctly determine the right insertion point for the given value in the sorted list. The provided test cases and the output hints confirm that the function works correctly for the given examples:

- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is the correct index to insert `6` to maintain the sorted order.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is the correct index to insert `3` to maintain the sorted order.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns `4`, which is the correct index to insert `7` to maintain the sorted order.

Since the function uses the `bisect.bisect_right()` method, it handles the case where the value is greater than all elements in the list by returning the length of the list. There are no other edge cases mentioned in the problem description or the output hints that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function correctly implements the required functionality for every potential case.
