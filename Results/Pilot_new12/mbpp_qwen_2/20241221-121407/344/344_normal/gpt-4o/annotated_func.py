#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer or float.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index in the list `sorted_list` where the `value` should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order, which is given by the function `bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers or floats (`sorted_list`) and a value (`value`). It returns the index in `sorted_list` where the `value` should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order. This is achieved using the `bisect.bisect_right()` function. The function handles the case where the `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list` by returning the length of `sorted_list`. There are no other potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special consideration.
