The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers or floats already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, which is an integer or float. The function returns the index in the list `sorted_list` where the `value` should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order, which is given by the function `bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers or floats and a value, and return the index where the value should be inserted to keep the list sorted.
