The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers or floats (`sorted_list`) and a value (`value`). It returns the index in `sorted_list` where the `value` should be inserted to maintain the list's sorted order. This is achieved using the `bisect.bisect_right()` function. The function handles the case where the `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list` by returning the length of `sorted_list`. There are no other potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special consideration.
