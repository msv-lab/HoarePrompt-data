Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. This is achieved by using the modulus operator `%` to check if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. According to the problem description, the task is to find the parity of a given number and determine if it is odd. The function correctly implements this logic for all valid integer inputs (positive, negative, and zero), as explained in the comments. Therefore, the program is correct.
