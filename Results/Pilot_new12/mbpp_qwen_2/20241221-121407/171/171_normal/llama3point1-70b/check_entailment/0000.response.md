Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by checking if `n % 2 != 0`. This logic is correct for all integers. There are no edge cases or special conditions that this function fails to handle. Therefore, the function works correctly according to the problem description for every potential case.
