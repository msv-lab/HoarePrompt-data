Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., `n % 2 != 0`) and `False` if `n` is even. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, covering all possible integer values, including positive, negative, and zero. Since the function works correctly for every potential case within the constraints of the problem description, the code is correct.
