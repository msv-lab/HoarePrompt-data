Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The given program checks if the given number `n` is odd by using the modulus operator `%`. The expression `n % 2 != 0` returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. However, the problem description asks for a function that determines the parity of a given number, which should return `True` if the number has odd parity (i.e., the number of 1s in its binary representation is odd) and `False` if it has even parity.

The current implementation simply checks if the number is odd, which is a different criterion. To meet the problem description, the function should count the number of 1s in the binary representation of the number and check if this count is odd. The provided program does not perform this task, so it is incorrect.
