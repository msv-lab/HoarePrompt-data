Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines the parity of a given number `n` by checking if `n % 2 != 0`. The provided output hints confirm that the function returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, covering all possible integer values (positive, negative, and zero). Since the function meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
