Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(n)` accurately determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The annotated version of the code supports this by stating that the function returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. Given the problem description asks for a function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, and the provided function indeed does so by checking if `n % 2 != 0`, the function meets the requirements. The annotations further clarify that the function works as intended for the specified use case. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
