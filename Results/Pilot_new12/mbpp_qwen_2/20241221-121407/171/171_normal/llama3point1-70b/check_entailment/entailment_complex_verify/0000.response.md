Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by checking if `n % 2 != 0`. The annotation confirms that the function returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. The annotated version also mentions that this logic covers all possible integer values, including positive, negative, and zero. Since the problem description asks for a function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, and the function meets this requirement for all integers, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
