Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks for a function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the number `n` is odd and `False` if it is even. According to the output hints, the function correctly determines the parity of the number by checking if the remainder of `n` when divided by 2 is not equal to 0. However, the function only checks if the number is odd, which is not sufficient to meet the problem description. The function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. Since the function does not cover the case where the number is even, it does not fully meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
