Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks to write a function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided function `func_1(n)` indeed checks if the number `n` is odd by returning `True` if `n % 2 != 0` and `False` otherwise. However, the problem description implies that the function should specifically return `True` if the number is odd, which the function correctly does. But the original assessment seems to misinterpret the problem statement slightly; the function does cover the case where the number is odd, and it does not need to explicitly handle the even case separately since the problem only requires checking for odd parity. Therefore, the function meets the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness being **False** is not accurate based on the provided code and annotations.
