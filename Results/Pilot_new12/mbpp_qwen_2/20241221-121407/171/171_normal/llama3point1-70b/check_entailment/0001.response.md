Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the number `n` is odd, which correctly identifies the parity of the number. However, the problem description asks to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. This implies checking if the number has an odd parity (i.e., if it is odd), but the function does not check for the opposite case (even parity). 

The function does not handle the case when the number is even, which would be required to fully meet the problem description. For example, if the input is `4`, the function returns `False` because `4 % 2 != 0` evaluates to `False`, indicating the number is not odd. However, according to the problem description, the function should return `True` if the number is even, and `False` if the number is odd.

Since the function does not cover all potential cases (both odd and even numbers), the program is incorrect.
