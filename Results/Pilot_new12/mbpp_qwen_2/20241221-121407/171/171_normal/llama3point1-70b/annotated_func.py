#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer, or False if n is an even integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd, or `False` if `n` is even. The function achieves this by computing the remainder of `n` when divided by 2 using the modulus operator `%`. If the remainder is not equal to 0, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is even. This covers all possible integer values, including positive, negative, and zero.
