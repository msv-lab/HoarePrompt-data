The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer. It returns `False` if `n` is an even integer. The function performs a modulus operation (`n % 2`) to determine if the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 is non-zero, which indicates an odd number. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code, but it correctly handles both positive and negative integers as well as zero, returning `False` for even numbers including zero and negative even numbers, and `True` for odd numbers including negative odd numbers.
