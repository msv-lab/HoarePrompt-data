Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not meet the problem description. The annotated version further confirms this. The function `func_1` returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires. The problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, meaning the function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the current implementation returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the required functionality.
