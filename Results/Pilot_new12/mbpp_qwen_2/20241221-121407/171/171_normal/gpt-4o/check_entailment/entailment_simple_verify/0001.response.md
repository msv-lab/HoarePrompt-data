Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` checks if a number is odd, which contradicts the problem description that asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. Specifically, the function should check if a number is even, i.e., it should return `n % 2 == 0`. The test cases provided in the annotated version further confirm that the function is currently returning the opposite of what is expected (odd instead of even). Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description.
