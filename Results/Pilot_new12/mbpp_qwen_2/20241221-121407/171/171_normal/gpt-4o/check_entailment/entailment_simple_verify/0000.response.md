Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` currently returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even using the condition `n % 2 != 0`. However, the problem description asks for a function that determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. This means the function should return `True` only if the number is odd. The provided function returns the opposite of what is required. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
