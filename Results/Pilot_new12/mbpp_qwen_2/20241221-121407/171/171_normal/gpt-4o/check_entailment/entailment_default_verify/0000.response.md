Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` uses the condition `n % 2 != 0` to determine if a number is odd. This means the function returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers, which is the opposite of what the problem description requires. The problem description asks for a function that checks if the parity of a given number is odd, meaning it should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. The correct implementation should use `n % 2 == 0` to check if the number is even. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
