Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks if a given number `n` is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`. However, the problem description asks for a function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function should return `True` if the number has odd parity (i.e., the number itself is odd), and `False` if the number has even parity (i.e., the number itself is even).

The annotated program correctly implements this logic. For any integer `n`, `n % 2 != 0` will return `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. Therefore, the program correctly determines the parity of the number and checks if it is odd.

The provided test cases also confirm this behavior:
- `func_1(12)` should return `False` because 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` should return `True` because 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` should return `False` because 10 is even.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and passes all the provided test cases, the program is correct. Therefore, the initial judgment was incorrect, and the program meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
