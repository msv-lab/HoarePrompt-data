Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` does not meet the problem description. The problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, but the function currently checks if a number is even. The test cases provided confirm that the function is returning the opposite of what is expected for determining odd numbers. Specifically, `func_1(12)` should return `False`, `func_1(7)` should return `False`, and `func_1(10)` should return `False`. However, the current implementation returns `True` for these cases. Therefore, the function needs to be corrected to `return n % 2 != 0` to accurately determine if the number is odd.
