Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a Python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the provided function `func_1` incorrectly uses the condition `n % 2 != 0`, which checks if the number is odd. To meet the problem description, the function should use the condition `n % 2 == 0` to check if the number is even. The annotations in the annotated version confirm that the function currently checks for odd numbers, which is contrary to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
