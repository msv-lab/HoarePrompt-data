Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to determine whether the parity (odd or even) of a given integer is odd. The function correctly uses the modulus operator (`%`) to check if the remainder when the integer `n` is divided by 2 is non-zero. 

- If `n % 2` is not equal to 0, the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is odd.
- If `n % 2` equals 0, the function returns `False`, indicating that `n` is even.

The provided test cases also confirm the functionality:
- `func_1(12)` should return `False` because 12 is an even number.
- `func_1(7)` should return `True` because 7 is an odd number.
- `func_1(10)` should return `False` because 10 is an even number.

Since the function behaves as expected for these test cases and the logic implemented in the function aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.
