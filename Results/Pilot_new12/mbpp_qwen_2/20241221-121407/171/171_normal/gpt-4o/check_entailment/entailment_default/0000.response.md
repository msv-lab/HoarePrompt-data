Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, which means the function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the code uses the expression `n % 2 != 0` which checks if the number is odd, not even. Therefore, the function `func_1` will return the opposite of what is required. For example, `func_1(12)` should return `False` because 12 is even, but the current implementation returns `True`. Similarly, `func_1(7)` should return `True` because 7 is odd, but it currently returns `False`.

To fix this, the function should be:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

This will correctly return `True` for even numbers and `False` for odd numbers, aligning with the problem description.
