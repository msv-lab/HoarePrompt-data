Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the parity check for finding whether a given number is odd. According to the problem description, the function should return `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. However, the implementation uses the condition `n % 2 != 0`, which actually checks if the number is odd. This means the function will return `False` for odd numbers and `True` for even numbers, which is the opposite of what is required. For example, `func_1(12)` should return `False` because 12 is even, but the current implementation returns `True`. Similarly, `func_1(7)` should return `True` because 7 is odd, but the current implementation returns `True`. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
