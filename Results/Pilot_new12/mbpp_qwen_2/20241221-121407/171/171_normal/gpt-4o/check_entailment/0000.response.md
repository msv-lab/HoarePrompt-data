Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program uses `n % 2 != 0` to determine the parity of a number, which checks if the number is odd. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function should check if the number is even instead. The correct implementation would be:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

This function returns `True` if the number is even and `False` if the number is odd, which aligns with the problem description. The provided function incorrectly returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers, which is the opposite of what the problem requires.
