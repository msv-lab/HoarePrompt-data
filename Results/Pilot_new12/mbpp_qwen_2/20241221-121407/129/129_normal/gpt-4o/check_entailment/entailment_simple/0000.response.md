Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. The assertions provided in the annotated program confirm that the function behaves as expected for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. Since the problem description only requires finding the ASCII value of a character, and the program correctly implements this functionality without any additional or missing features, the program is correct.
