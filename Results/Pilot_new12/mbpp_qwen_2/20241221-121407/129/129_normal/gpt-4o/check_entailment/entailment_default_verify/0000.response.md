Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of a given character. The assertions provided in the test cases confirm that the function works as expected for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. While the output hints indicate that the function will still execute for an empty string or a string containing more than one character, these cases are not covered by the problem description. The problem description specifically asks to find the ASCII value of a character, implying a single character input. Therefore, the original assessment is correct in determining the program's correctness as True.
