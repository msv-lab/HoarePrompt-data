Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the input character. The assertions provided in the test cases verify this behavior with the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S', which have ASCII values 65, 82, and 83 respectively. Since the function works as expected for these cases and there is no indication that it would fail for other characters (as `ord()` is a built-in function that handles all valid ASCII characters), we can conclude that the function is correct for all potential cases.
