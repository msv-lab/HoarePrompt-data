Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of a given character. The assertions provided in the test cases confirm that the function works as expected for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. Since the `ord()` function handles all printable ASCII characters correctly and the provided test cases cover a few examples, we can infer that the function will work for any character within the printable ASCII range. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified that would make this function incorrect for the given problem description.
