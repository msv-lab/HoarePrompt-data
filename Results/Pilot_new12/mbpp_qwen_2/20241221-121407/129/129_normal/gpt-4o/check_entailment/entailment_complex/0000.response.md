Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII numeric value using the built-in `ord()` function. The problem description states that the function should find the ASCII value of a character. 

The program meets the requirements because:
1. It accepts a single character string as input.
2. It uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the character.
3. The provided assertions (`assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, `assert func_1('S') == 83`) confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases.

Since the function only processes a single character string and returns its ASCII value, and the provided test cases match the expected behavior, the program is correct according to the problem description.
