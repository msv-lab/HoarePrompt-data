Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a single character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. The assertions provided in the code validate that the function works correctly for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S', returning the expected ASCII values (65, 82, and 83 respectively).

Given the problem description and the provided output hints, the function behaves as expected for the intended inputs. The code handles a single character string as required and does not include any additional logic that would alter the behavior for different types of inputs, such as empty strings or multi-character strings. Since the code is correct for every potential case within the constraints provided, the correctness is **True**.
