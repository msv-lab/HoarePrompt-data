Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality of returning the ASCII value of a given character using the `ord()` function. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. The annotated version further clarifies that the input `char` is a single character string before the function call, which aligns with the intended use of the `ord()` function. Since the input is assumed to be valid and the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
