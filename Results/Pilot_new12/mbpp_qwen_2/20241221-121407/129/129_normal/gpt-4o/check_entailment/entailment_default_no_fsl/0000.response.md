Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character string and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function. The assertions in the code verify that the function works correctly for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S', which correspond to ASCII values 65, 82, and 83, respectively. The problem description asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character, and the code fulfills this requirement for the given examples. Since the code handles the specified cases correctly and the problem description does not specify additional edge cases like empty strings or multi-character strings (which would be invalid inputs), the code is correct for every potential case as described.
