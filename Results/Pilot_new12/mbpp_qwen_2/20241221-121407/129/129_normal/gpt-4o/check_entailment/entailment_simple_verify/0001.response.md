Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the input character. The annotations support this behavior by clearly stating that `char` is a single character string and that the function returns the ASCII numeric value of the character. The assertions provided in the test cases verify this behavior with the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S', which have ASCII values 65, 82, and 83 respectively. Given the problem description and the provided code, the function meets the requirements and behaves as expected for the given test cases.
