The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII numeric value. There are no additional actions or transformations performed on the input character beyond obtaining its ASCII value. This means that the function will work correctly for any valid single character string input. However, if an empty string or a string containing more than one character is passed, the function will still execute but the behavior is not specified by the current code, which only handles a single character string as intended.
