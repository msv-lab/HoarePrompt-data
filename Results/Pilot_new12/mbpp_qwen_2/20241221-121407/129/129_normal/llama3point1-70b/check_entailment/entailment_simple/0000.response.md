Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the task described in the problem statement. The function takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. Since the problem description asks for a function that finds the ASCII value of a character, and the function `func_1` accomplishes this exactly, the program is correct. The function handles the expected input and produces the correct output as specified.
