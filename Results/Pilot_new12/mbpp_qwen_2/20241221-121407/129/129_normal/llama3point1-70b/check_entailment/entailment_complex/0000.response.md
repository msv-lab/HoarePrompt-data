Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character string `char` as input and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function. This exactly matches the problem description which asks to write a function to find the ASCII value of a character. The function does not perform any additional actions beyond returning the ASCII value, which is consistent with the problem description. Since the input is assumed to be valid (a single character string), the function correctly implements the required functionality in all cases.
