Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the given character, which aligns perfectly with the problem description of finding the ASCII value of a character. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected by simply returning the ASCII value without any additional actions or edge cases needing to be handled. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
