Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of the given character using the `ord` function. The annotated version confirms that the function operates on a single character string and returns its ASCII value, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail under the given assumptions. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
