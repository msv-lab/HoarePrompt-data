Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII numeric value using the `ord()` function. There are no edge cases or functionalities missing that would invalidate the original assessment. The function meets the problem description of finding the ASCII value of a character, and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation.
