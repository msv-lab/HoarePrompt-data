Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description of finding the ASCII value of a character. The provided output hints confirm that the function simply returns the ASCII value of the given character using the `ord()` function, which is the expected behavior. There are no edge cases or functionalities missing based on the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
