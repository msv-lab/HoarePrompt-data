Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the given character. The annotated version confirms that the function takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Since the input is assumed to be valid (a single character string), the function behaves as expected and is correct.
