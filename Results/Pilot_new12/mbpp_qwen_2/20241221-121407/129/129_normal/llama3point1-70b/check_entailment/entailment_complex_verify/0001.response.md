Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly takes a single character string `char` as input and returns its ASCII numeric value using the `ord()` function. There are no edge cases or additional functionalities needed as per the problem description, which asks for a function to find the ASCII value of a character. The annotated version supports that the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description without any issues.
