Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list into a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor. The examples given in the output hints and the assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the provided test cases. Since the problem description only requires converting a list to a tuple, and the function successfully does this without any issues, the code is correct for every potential valid case.
