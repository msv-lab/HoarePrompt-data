Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. This matches the problem description of converting a list to a tuple. The provided assertions in the annotated version also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that this function fails to handle. Therefore, the function `func_1` is correct based on the provided information.
