Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as demonstrated by the assertions. The annotated version supports this by clearly stating that the function accepts a list and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. Since there are no edge cases or special scenarios mentioned that the function does not handle, and the provided test cases cover typical usage, the original assessment is maintained.
