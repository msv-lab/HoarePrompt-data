Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list as an argument and returns a tuple containing all the elements of the list. The assertions provided in the annotated program demonstrate that the function correctly converts lists into tuples. Since the problem description simply requires the conversion of a list to a tuple, and the provided function accomplishes this task correctly for the given test cases, the program is correct.
