Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple using the built-in `tuple` function. The annotations clearly indicate that the function takes a list (`lst`) as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. The provided test cases in the annotations confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs. Since the function handles valid list inputs correctly and there are no edge cases or potential issues identified that would cause the function to fail, the program meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
