Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The examples given in the assertions demonstrate this:

1. `assert func_1([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]) == (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`
2. `assert func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]) == (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)`
3. `assert func_1([58, 44, 56]) == (58, 44, 56)`

The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list to a tuple, which is the correct approach. There are no edge cases or special scenarios that the provided function does not handle. Therefore, the function works correctly for the given problem description in all tested cases.
