Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code. The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor. The output hints confirm that the function works as expected, converting the input list into a tuple without any issues. Since the problem description asks to write a function that converts a list to a tuple, and the provided code accomplishes this task accurately and completely, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
