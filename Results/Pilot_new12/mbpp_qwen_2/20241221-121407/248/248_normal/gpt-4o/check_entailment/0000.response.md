Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The examples given all produce the expected results:
- `func_1([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3])` returns `(5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)`
- `func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7])` returns `(2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)`
- `func_1([58, 44, 56])` returns `(58, 44, 56)`

Since the function uses the built-in `tuple` function to convert the list to a tuple, it will work correctly for any input list. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
