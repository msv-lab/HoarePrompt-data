Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which states to write a function to convert a list to a tuple. The original assessment correctly identified that the function works correctly for all potential cases given valid input. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
