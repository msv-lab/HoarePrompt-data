Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `input_list`, which is expected to be a list. The function then converts this list into a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function and returns the resulting tuple. Since the problem description asks to write a function that converts a list to a tuple, and the provided function accomplishes this exactly, the program is correct. Additionally, the function handles lists of any length, including an empty list, which results in an empty tuple. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that suggest the function does not handle certain inputs correctly under the given assumptions.
