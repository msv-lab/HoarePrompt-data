Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` converts a list to a tuple. The annotated version confirms that `input_list` is a list before the function call and that the function returns a tuple containing all elements from the list. Since the function behaves as expected and the annotations support this behavior, the original assessment is accurate.
