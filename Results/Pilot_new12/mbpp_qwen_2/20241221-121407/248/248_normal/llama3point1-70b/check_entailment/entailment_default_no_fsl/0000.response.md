Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements of the list. This directly meets the problem description of converting a list to a tuple. The function handles lists of any length, including an empty list, which results in an empty tuple. Since the problem description does not specify any additional requirements or edge cases beyond converting a list to a tuple, and the function satisfies these basic requirements without any issues, the code is correct.
