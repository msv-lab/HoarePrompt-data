Final: **True**

Reasoning: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list into a tuple, as described in the problem statement. The output hints confirm that the function works for lists of any length, including an empty list, and does not modify the original list, instead returning a new tuple containing all elements from the input list. Since the function meets the requirements and there are no contradictions or issues identified based on the problem description and output hints, the original assessment of correctness remains accurate.
