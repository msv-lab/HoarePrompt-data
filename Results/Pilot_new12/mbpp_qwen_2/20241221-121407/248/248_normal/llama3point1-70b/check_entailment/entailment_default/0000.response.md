Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes an input list and returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list. The code handles lists of any length, including an empty list, which would result in an empty tuple. There are no edge cases or invalid inputs mentioned that the code does not handle, and the behavior described in the output hints matches the implementation of the function. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
