Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `input_list`, which is expected to be a list. It converts this list into a tuple and returns the tuple. The function ensures that all elements from the original list are included in the returned tuple. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code or annotations, but generally, the function will handle lists of any length, including an empty list, resulting in an empty tuple. The function does not modify the original list; it creates a new tuple from the list and returns it.**

This summary focuses on the actual behavior of the function as defined by the code, without detailing the implementation.
