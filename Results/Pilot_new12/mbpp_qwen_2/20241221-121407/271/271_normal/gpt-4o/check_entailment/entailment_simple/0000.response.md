Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing numeric values. This matches the requirement that the function should take a tuple of tuples as input.

2. **Number of Elements Calculation**: The program calculates the number of elements (`num_elements`) in the first tuple of `tuples`. This ensures that the program can iterate over all positions of the tuples uniformly.

3. **Averaging Logic**:
   - A list comprehension `[t[i] for t in tuples]` is used to extract the `i-th` element from each tuple in `tuples`.
   - The `sum` function is used to calculate the total sum of these extracted elements.
   - The average is computed by dividing this sum by the number of tuples (`len(tuples)`).
   - These averages are appended to the `averages` list.

4. **Returning the Result**: After the loop completes, the `averages` list is returned, containing the average values for each position across all tuples.

Given the assertions provided, the function correctly computes the averages for each position across all tuples. Here are the key points supporting the correctness:

- The function handles different sizes and values within the input tuples correctly.
- It iterates through each position and calculates the average accurately.
- The function returns a list of averages as specified in the problem description.

Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all given cases, it is correct. Therefore, the output is `True`.
