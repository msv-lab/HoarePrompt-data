Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The output hints confirm that the function handles the expected input types (numeric values in tuples) and calculates the averages as required. The provided test cases cover various scenarios including positive and negative numbers and tuples of different lengths, and the function executes correctly in all cases. There is no indication from the output hints that the function fails to meet the problem description or contains any logical errors. Thus, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
