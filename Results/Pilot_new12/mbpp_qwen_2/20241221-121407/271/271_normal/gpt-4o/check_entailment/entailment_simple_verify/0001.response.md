Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at different points, confirming that the function iterates through each position of the tuples, calculates the average, and appends it to the `averages` list. The provided test cases in the assertions cover various scenarios and the function passes them correctly. Since the annotations align with the expected behavior and the function meets the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
