Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a single argument `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing numeric values. The program does not check if the input is a list or if the tuples contain numeric values, which aligns with the assumption that the input will be valid.

2. **Calculation of Averages**: 
   - The program correctly calculates the number of elements (`num_elements`) in the first tuple, which ensures that the same number of averages are computed.
   - It iterates through each position (index) of the tuples using a `for` loop.
   - For each position, it collects the corresponding elements from each tuple into a list called `elements_at_position`.
   - It then calculates the average of these collected elements and appends the result to the `averages` list.

3. **Output**: The function returns a list of the calculated averages, which matches the requirement of returning a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

Given that the program correctly implements the described functionality without any issues or edge cases that would violate the problem statement, it is correct.
