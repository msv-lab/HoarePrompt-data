Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position. The function `func_1` iterates through each position in the first tuple (determined by `num_elements = len(tuples[0])`) and computes the average of the values at that position across all tuples. The program handles all the given test cases correctly and should work for any valid input of tuples with numeric values. There doesn't appear to be any edge cases or specific inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the problem description and the provided examples.
