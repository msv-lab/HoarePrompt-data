Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position. The output hints confirm that the function handles the input as expected and executes correctly for the given test cases. The function works as intended, even for edge cases such as empty lists, as indicated by the output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is valid.
