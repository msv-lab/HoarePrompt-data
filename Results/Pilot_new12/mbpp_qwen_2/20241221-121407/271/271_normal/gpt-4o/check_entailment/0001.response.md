Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided `func_1` function correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The function iterates over the first tuple to determine the number of elements and then calculates the average for each position across all tuples. The provided test cases cover different scenarios including positive and negative numbers, and tuples with varying lengths. The function handles these cases correctly, and no edge cases or potential errors were identified that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
