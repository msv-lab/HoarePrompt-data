Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the average of the values at each position across all tuples in the input list of tuples. The code handles various cases, including when the input list `tuples` is empty, as it will return an empty list in such scenarios. Additionally, the code works for tuples of different lengths and types of numbers (integers or floats).

Given the assertions provided, the function `func_1` produces the correct output for the given test cases. The code iterates through each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for every potential case as described in the problem statement.
