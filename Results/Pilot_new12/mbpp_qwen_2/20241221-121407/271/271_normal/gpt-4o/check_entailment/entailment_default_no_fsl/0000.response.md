Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position into a list, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The code handles all the given test cases correctly and produces the expected results. The code also handles cases where the input list `tuples` is empty or any of the tuples within it is empty by returning an empty list. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case mentioned in the problem description.
