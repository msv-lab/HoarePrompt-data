Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotations clearly show that the function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including positive and negative numbers, and tuples with varying lengths, and the function passes these tests successfully. There are no indications from the annotations that suggest any errors or issues with the function's implementation. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
