Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the program appears to be correct. The function `func_1` iterates through each position in the first tuple to calculate the average of the values at that position across all tuples. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program at different points, and the provided test cases validate the functionality of the function. The program handles valid inputs as expected and produces the correct output according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
