Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position. The function initializes `num_elements` with the length of the first tuple, ensuring that it correctly iterates over all positions in the tuples. For each position, it collects the values from all tuples, calculates their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. The provided test cases in the assertions correctly validate the function's behavior, and the annotated version confirms that the program logic aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
