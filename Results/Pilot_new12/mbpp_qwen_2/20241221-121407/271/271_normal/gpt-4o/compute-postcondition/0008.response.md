The code calculates the new value of `avg` by taking the sum of `elements_at_position` and dividing it by the length of `tuples`. The value of `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, and `i` is 1. The initial value of `avg` remains the average of the first elements in each tuple in `tuples`.

After executing the code:
- `avg` is updated to the new value calculated as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

Output State: **`averages` is `[new_avg]`, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `i` is 1, and `new_avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.**
