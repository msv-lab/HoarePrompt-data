The code calculates the average of the first elements in each tuple in the `elements_at_position` list. This is done by taking the sum of `elements_at_position` and dividing it by the length of `tuples`. 

- The `averages` list remains empty since no value is appended to it in this snippet.
- The `elements_at_position` list is not modified.
- The `num_elements` and `i` variables are not affected.

Let's denote the number of elements in `tuples` as `n` (where `n` is the length of `tuples`). The value of `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`. The average `avg` is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{avg} = \frac{\sum_{j=0}^{n-1} \text{elements\_at\_position}[j]}{n} \]

Since the exact values in `elements_at_position` are not provided, we can represent the average as:

\[ \text{avg} = \frac{\sum \text{elements\_at\_position}}{len(\text{tuples})} \]

Therefore, the updated states are:

- `averages` is still an empty list.
- `elements_at_position` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains 0.
- `tuples` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`averages` is an empty list, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first element from each tuple in `tuples`, `i` is 0, and `avg` is the average of the first elements in each tuple in `tuples`.**
