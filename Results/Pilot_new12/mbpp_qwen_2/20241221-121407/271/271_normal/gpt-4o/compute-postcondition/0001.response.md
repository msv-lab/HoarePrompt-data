The code initializes an empty list named `averages`. The value of `tuples` and `num_elements` remains unchanged. Therefore, the only new information is the existence of the `averages` list.

Output State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` is the number of elements in the first tuple of `tuples`, `averages` is an empty list**
