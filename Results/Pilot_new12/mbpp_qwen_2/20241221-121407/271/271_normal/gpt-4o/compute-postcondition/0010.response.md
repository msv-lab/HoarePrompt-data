According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num_elements`. At the end of the last iteration, `averages` is `[new_avg, new_avg]`, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, and `i` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. The list `elements_at_position` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to continue executing, as `i` is now 2.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`averages` is `[new_avg, new_avg]`, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples` that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
