The code updates `elements_at_position` to a list comprehension that extracts the element at position `i` (which is 2) from each tuple in `tuples`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `tuples`, we can represent `elements_at_position` as a list of the third elements from each tuple in `tuples`.

Given the initial state:
- `averages` is `[new_avg, new_avg]`
- `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`
- `i` is 2

After executing the code, `elements_at_position` will be updated to a list of the third elements from each tuple in `tuples`.

Output State: **`averages` is `[new_avg, new_avg]`; `elements_at_position` is a list of the third elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `i` is 2**
