According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `num_elements`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `num_elements`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `averages` is a list containing one element `[avg]`.
- `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first element from each tuple in `tuples`.
- `i` is 0.
- `avg` is the average of the first elements in each tuple in `tuples`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. Additionally, for the loop to continue, `num_elements` must be greater than 1.

Given this information, we need to adjust the state accordingly.

State: **`averages` is [avg], `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first element from each tuple in `tuples`, `i` is 1, and `avg` remains the average of the first elements in each tuple in `tuples`.**
