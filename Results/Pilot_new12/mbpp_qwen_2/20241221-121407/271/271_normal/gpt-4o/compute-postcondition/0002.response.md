According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_elements`. The loop will execute as long as `num_elements` is at least 1. Additionally, `i` needs to be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. The `num_elements` variable must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
2. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 at the start of the loop.

Given these considerations, the state before the loop starts should be modified to reflect these requirements.

State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `averages` is an empty list**
