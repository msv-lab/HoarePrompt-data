The code `elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]` iterates over each tuple `t` in the list `tuples` and assigns the element at index `i` (which is 1) to the corresponding position in the list `elements_at_position`. Given that `i` is 1, the `elements_at_position` will be a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`.

The initial state is:
- `averages` is `[avg]`
- `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first element from each tuple in `tuples`
- `i` is 1
- `avg` remains the average of the first elements in each tuple in `tuples`

After executing the code, `elements_at_position` will be updated to contain the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`averages` is `[avg]`, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `i` is 1, and `avg` remains the average of the first elements in each tuple in `tuples`.**
