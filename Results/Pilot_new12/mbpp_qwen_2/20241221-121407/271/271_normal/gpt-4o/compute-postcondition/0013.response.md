The code `averages.append(avg)` appends the value of `avg` to the list `averages`. The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `averages` is a list containing `[new_avg, new_avg]`.
- `elements_at_position` is a list of the third elements from each tuple in `tuples`.
- `i` is 2.
- `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`.

Since the code appends `avg` to `averages`, the updated `averages` will be `[new_avg, new_avg, avg]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`averages` is `[new_avg, new_avg, avg]`; `elements_at_position` is a list of the third elements from each tuple in `tuples`; `i` is 2; `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`.**
