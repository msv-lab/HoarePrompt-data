Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a list of tuples containing numeric values (integers or floats). It calculates the average of the values at each position across all tuples in `tuples` and returns a list of these averages. The function iterates over each position in the tuples, collects the values at that position into a list, computes their average, and appends the result to the `averages` list. If the input list `tuples` is empty or any of the tuples within it is empty, the function will still execute correctly and return an empty list for `averages`.**
