The code creates a new list `elements_at_position` by extracting the `i`-th element from each tuple in the `tuples` list. Since `i` is initially set to 0, this means that `elements_at_position` will contain the first element from each tuple in `tuples`. 

- `tuples` remains unchanged.
- `num_elements` is not used in the given code.
- `i` remains 0 since the code does not modify its value.
- `averages` remains an empty list since the code does not modify it.

Therefore, the output state is: `tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `averages` is an empty list; `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first element from each tuple in `tuples`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a list of tuples, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0, `averages` is an empty list; `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first element from each tuple in `tuples`.**
