The code `averages.append(avg)` appends the value of `avg` (which is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`) to the list `averages`. The initial state is that `averages` is `[new_avg]`, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `i` is 1, and `new_avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

After executing the code, `averages` will contain the initial value `new_avg` plus the new average `avg`, which is the same as `new_avg` because the initial state already shows that `new_avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the value of `elements_at_position` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`averages` is `[new_avg, new_avg]`, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `i` is 1.**
