`averages` is an empty list, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first element from each tuple in `tuples`, `i` is 0, and `avg` is the average of the first elements in each tuple in `tuples`. The code appends `avg` to the list `averages`.

Output State: **`averages` is [avg], `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first element from each tuple in `tuples`, `i` is 0, and `avg` is the average of the first elements in each tuple in `tuples`.**
