Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a list of tuples containing numerical values (integers or floats). It returns a list of tuples, where each tuple contains the average of the corresponding elements from the tuples in the original list `tuples`. The function achieves this by using the `zip` function to transpose the list of tuples, then calculating the sum and average of each transposed element. 

Potential edge cases and considerations:
- If `tuples` is an empty list, the function will return an empty list.
- If `tuples` contains only one tuple, the function will return a single tuple with the same elements as the original tuple.
- The function assumes that all tuples in the list have the same length. If tuples of different lengths are provided, the function will still calculate the average based on the common elements, potentially leading to unexpected results for shorter tuples.**

This summary covers the core functionality of the function and highlights potential edge cases and considerations that should be noted.
