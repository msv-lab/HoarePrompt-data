Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. Given the problem description, the function takes a list of tuples, transposes the list using `zip(*tuples)` to get tuples of values at the same positions, sums these values, and then divides by the number of tuples to get the average. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for any list of tuples with the same length, as required by the problem description. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem statement.
