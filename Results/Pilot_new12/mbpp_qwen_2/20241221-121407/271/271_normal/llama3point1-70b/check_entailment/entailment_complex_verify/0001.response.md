Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotations support this by explaining how the function transposes the list of tuples using `zip(*tuples)`, sums the values, and calculates the average. The function handles valid inputs as described in the problem statement, including edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single tuple. While the function assumes that all tuples have the same length, the problem description does not specify this constraint, making the function's behavior consistent with the given requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
