Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program `func_1` meets the problem description. The program takes a list of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the sum and average to be computed for each position across all tuples. The output hints further confirm this behavior and highlight potential edge cases such as handling an empty list or tuples of different lengths, which the function correctly processes without error. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness remains accurate.
