Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The provided code and the output hints confirm that the function transposes the list of tuples using `zip(*tuples)`, calculates the sum of each transposed element, and then divides by the number of tuples to get the average. This approach aligns with the problem description and the output hints. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles the expected use cases and potential edge cases mentioned in the output hints without failing. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
