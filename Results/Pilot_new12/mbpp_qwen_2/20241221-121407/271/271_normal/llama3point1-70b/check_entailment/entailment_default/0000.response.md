Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the function to iterate over corresponding elements and calculate their average. The function handles the edge cases mentioned in the output hints:

- If `tuples` is an empty list, the function returns an empty list.
- If `tuples` contains only one tuple, the function returns a single tuple with the same elements as the original tuple.
- The function assumes that all tuples in the list have the same length, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description and the nature of the operation.

Since the function works correctly for the described cases and the provided output hints agree with the implementation, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
