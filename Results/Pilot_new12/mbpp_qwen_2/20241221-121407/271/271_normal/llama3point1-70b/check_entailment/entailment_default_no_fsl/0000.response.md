Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not meet the problem description because it returns a list instead of a list of tuples. According to the problem description, the function should return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. However, the code returns a list of floats, not a list of tuples. This discrepancy indicates that the function does not handle the requirement to return a list of tuples as specified.
