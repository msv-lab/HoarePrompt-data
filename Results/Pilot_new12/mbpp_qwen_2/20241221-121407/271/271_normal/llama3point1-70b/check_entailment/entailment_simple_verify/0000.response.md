Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code clarifies that `tuples` is a list of tuples containing numerical values, which aligns with the problem description requiring the function to take a tuple of tuples and return a list of averages. The code transposes the list of tuples using `zip(*tuples)`, sums the corresponding elements, and then divides by the length of the tuples to compute the average. This approach ensures that the function correctly calculates the average for each position across all tuples. The original assessment is accurate because the provided implementation meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
