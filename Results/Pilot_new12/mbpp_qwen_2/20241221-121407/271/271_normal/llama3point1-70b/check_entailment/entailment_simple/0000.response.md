Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to take a single parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing numerical values.
2. **Computation of Averages**: The program uses the `zip(*tuples)` construct to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over elements at the same index across all tuples. It then calculates the sum of these elements and divides by the number of tuples (`len(tuples)`) to get the average.
3. **List Comprehension**: The result of the calculation is returned as a list of averages, with each element being the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

Given these points, the program consistently performs the required operation for any valid input list of tuples, thus meeting the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
