Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly computes the average of corresponding elements across all tuples in the input list. The annotations accurately describe the function's behavior, stating that it returns a list of tuples where each tuple contains the average of the corresponding elements from the tuples in the original list. The original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets the problem description. The potential edge cases mentioned in the annotations, such as handling an empty list or tuples of different lengths, do not invalidate the function's correctness; they merely describe additional behaviors that could be considered in further analysis or documentation, but do not affect the core functionality of the program meeting the given problem description.
