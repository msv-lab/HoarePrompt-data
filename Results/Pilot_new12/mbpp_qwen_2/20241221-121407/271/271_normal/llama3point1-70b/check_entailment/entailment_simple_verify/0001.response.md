Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a list of averages for each position across all tuples. Since the problem description requires a function that takes a list of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple, the function meets this requirement. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
