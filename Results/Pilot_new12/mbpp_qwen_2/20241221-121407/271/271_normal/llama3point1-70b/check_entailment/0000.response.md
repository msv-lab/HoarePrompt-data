Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The expression `[sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]` uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing the sum of corresponding elements to be calculated easily. This approach works for any number of tuples and any number of elements within each tuple, as long as the tuples have the same structure. There doesn't appear to be any edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
