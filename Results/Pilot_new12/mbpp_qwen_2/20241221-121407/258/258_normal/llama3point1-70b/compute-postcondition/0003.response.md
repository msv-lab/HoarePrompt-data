According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character (digit) in the string `num_str`. For the loop to execute, `num_str` must contain at least one character. The initial value of `num` and `num_len` (which is the length of `num_str`) are given, but they don't directly influence whether the loop can execute. The key variable here is `num_str`, as it determines the number of iterations the loop will perform.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

1. `num` is an integer, and its string representation (`num_str`) must exist and have at least one character.
2. `num_len` (the length of `num_str`) should reflect the actual length of `num_str`.
3. `sum` is initialized to 0 and will accumulate values during the loop iterations, but its initial value does not affect whether the loop can execute.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `num_str` must have at least one character.

State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is 0**
