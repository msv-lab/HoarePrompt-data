The code snippet updates the `sum` variable by adding the current digit (converted to an integer) raised to the power of `num_len - 1`. 

- `digit` is a part of `num_str`, which is the string representation of `num` with the first character removed.
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str` - 1, which means it is the number of digits in `num_str`.

The impact of the code is to modify the value of `sum` based on the current digit and the updated `num_len`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `num` or `num_str`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `sum`. However, we can express the new value of `sum` in terms of the previous `sum` and the current digit.

Let's denote the current digit by `d` (where `d` is a character in `num_str`). The new value of `sum` will be:

\[ \text{new\_sum} = \text{sum} + d^{(\text{num\_len} - 1)} \]

Given this, the output state is:

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` with the first character removed, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` - 1, `sum` is the updated sum including the current digit `d` raised to the power of `num_len - 1`.**
