The code `num_len = len(num_str)` calculates the length of the string `num_str` and assigns it to the variable `num_len`. Since `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, the value of `num_len` will be the number of characters in `num_str`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's denote the length of `num_str` as `L`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `num`; `num_len` is L**
