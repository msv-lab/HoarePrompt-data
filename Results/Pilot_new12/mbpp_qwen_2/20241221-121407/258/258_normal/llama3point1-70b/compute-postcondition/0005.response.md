According to the code, the loop iterates over each digit in `num_str`. The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more digits in `num_str`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` is an integer
- `num_str` is a string representation of `num`
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str`
- `sum` is 0 + int(first digit of `num_str`)

To determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:
1. `digit` will be the current digit being processed in `num_str`.
2. After processing each digit, `sum` will be updated to include the value of the current digit.

Since we need to move to the next digit in `num_str`, `num_str` will be one character shorter. The variable `digit` will hold the current digit, and `sum` will be updated to include this digit.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `num` is still an integer
   - `num_str` is now a string that is one character shorter than before (the first digit has been processed)
   - `num_len` will be reduced by 1, as `num_str` is now one character shorter
   - `sum` includes the value of the first digit plus the sum of all previously processed digits

For the next iteration to occur, the loop needs to process the next digit in `num_str`. Therefore:
- `num_str` must be reduced by one character (one digit has been processed)
- `digit` will be the next digit in `num_str`
- `sum` will be updated to include the value of `digit`

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` with the first character removed, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` - 1, `sum` is the sum of the first digit and the value of the next digit in `num_str`**
