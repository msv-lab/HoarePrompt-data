Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is the empty string (after all digits are processed), `num_len` is 0, `sum` is the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each digit in `num_str` and adds the digit raised to the power of `num_len` to `sum`.
- `num_str` starts as the string representation of `num` and gets progressively shorter with each iteration.
- Once all digits are processed, `num_str` becomes an empty string.
- `num_len` starts as the length of `num_str` and decreases by 1 with each iteration until it reaches 0.
- After the loop completes, `sum` contains the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.

In the case where the loop does not execute (i.e., `num_str` is empty initially or becomes empty very quickly due to its content), the values will be:
- `num` remains unchanged as an integer.
- `num_str` is an empty string.
- `num_len` is 0.
- `sum` is 0.
