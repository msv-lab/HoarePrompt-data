`sum` is incremented by the value of `digit` raised to the power of `num_len`. The `digit` refers to the current digit being processed in `num_str`, and `num_len` is the length of `num_str` - 1.

Since the exact `digit` and `num_len` are not specified, let's consider a general case where `digit` is the first digit of `num_str` and `num_len` is the length of `num_str` - 1.

- Initially, `sum` is the sum of the first digit and the value of the next digit in `num_str`.
- After the code execution, `sum` will be updated to include the current digit raised to the power of `num_len`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` with the first character removed, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` - 1, `sum` is the updated sum including the current digit raised to the power of `num_len`.**
