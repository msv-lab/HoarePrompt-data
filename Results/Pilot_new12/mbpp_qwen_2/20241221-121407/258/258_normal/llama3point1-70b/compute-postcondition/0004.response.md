The code `sum += int(digit) ** num_len` increments `sum` by the value of `int(digit) ** num_len`. Here, `digit` is a substring of `num_str` and `num_len` is the length of `num_str`.

Given the initial state:
- `num` is an integer,
- `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character,
- `num_len` is the length of `num_str`,
- `sum` is 0.

Since the code does not specify which digit from `num_str` to use, we assume it uses the first digit (from left to right). Let's denote the first digit as `digit`.

The operation `int(digit) ** num_len` calculates the first digit of `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`. This value is then added to `sum`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `num` remains unchanged (it is an integer),
- `num_str` remains unchanged (it is a string representation of `num`),
- `num_len` remains unchanged (it is the length of `num_str`),
- `sum` is incremented by `int(digit) ** num_len`, where `digit` is the first digit of `num_str`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is 0 + int(first digit of `num_str`) ** `num_len`**
