Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `num` is an integer.
   - `num_str` is a string representation of `num` with the first character removed.
   - `num_len` is the length of `num_str` - 1.
   - `sum` is the updated sum including the current digit raised to the power of `num_len`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for digit in num_str:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each digit in `num_str`.
   - For each iteration, the digit is processed, and it is raised to the power of `num_len` (which is the current length of `num_str` minus 1).
   - The result of this operation is added to `sum`.

4. **State Adjustments Needed for Next Iteration:**
   - Since we are iterating over each digit in `num_str`, the length of `num_str` will decrease by one after each iteration.
   - Therefore, `num_len` will decrease by one after each iteration.

5. **New State After Next Iteration:**
   - `num` remains unchanged because the loop only processes the digits of `num_str`.
   - `num_str` will lose its first digit after processing the current digit.
   - `num_len` will be decremented by one.
   - `sum` will be updated based on the current digit being processed and the new value of `num_len`.

Given these observations, let's adjust the state for the next iteration:

- The length of `num_str` decreases by one, so `num_len` should be `num_len - 1`.
- The first digit of `num_str` is processed, so `num_str` will have one less digit.

Thus, the new state for the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` with the first character removed, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` - 1, `sum` is the updated sum including the current digit raised to the power of `num_len - 1`.**

To put it in the required format:
State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` with the first character removed, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` - 1, `sum` is the updated sum including the current digit raised to the power of `num_len - 1`.**
