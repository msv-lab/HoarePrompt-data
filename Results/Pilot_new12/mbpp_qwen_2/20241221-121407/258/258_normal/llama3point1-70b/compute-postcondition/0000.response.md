`num_str` is assigned the value of `str(num)`, which converts the integer `num` into a string. The original value of `num` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is an integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `num`.

Output State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `num`**
