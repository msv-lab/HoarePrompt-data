The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `sum`. This initializes `sum` but does not affect the values of `num`, `num_str`, or `num_len`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`num` is an integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `num`; `num_len` is L; `sum` is 0**
