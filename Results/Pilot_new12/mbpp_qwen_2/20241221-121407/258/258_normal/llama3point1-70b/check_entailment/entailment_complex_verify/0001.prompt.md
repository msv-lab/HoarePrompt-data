You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits). The function converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this sum to the original number. This logic works for all potential cases, including edge cases like single-digit numbers (since \(n^n = n\) for any single-digit \(n\)). Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is an integer, `num_str` is the empty string (after all digits are processed), `num_len` is 0, `sum` is the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.
    return sum == num
    #The program returns True if the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len` equals `num`, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` as a parameter. It converts `num` into a string `num_str` and calculates the length of `num_str` as `num_len`. Then, it iterates through each digit of `num_str`, converting each digit back to an integer and raising it to the power of `num_len`. These values are summed up and stored in `sum`. After processing all digits, the function checks if `sum` equals the original `num`. If `sum` equals `num`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include: (1) If `num` is 0, the function should return `True` since 0^0 is considered 1 by convention in such contexts. (2) Negative numbers are not valid inputs for this function, and it will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert them to a string. The function does not handle non-integer inputs; such inputs will result in a `TypeError`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
