Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly implement the logic for checking if a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The current implementation raises each digit to the power of the total number of digits in the number, rather than the number of digits itself. For example, for the number 153 (which is an Armstrong number), the correct calculation would be \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\), but the code calculates \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3\) where 3 is the total number of digits, not the number of digits itself. Therefore, the code incorrectly identifies 153 as a non-Armstrong number.
