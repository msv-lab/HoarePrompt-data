Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. The provided code accurately implements the logic described in the problem description, which involves converting the number to a string, calculating the power of each digit, summing these powers, and comparing the result to the original number. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases appropriately, such as the special case where `num` is 0, and notes that the function does not handle invalid inputs (negative numbers and non-integer inputs), but this is consistent with the assumption that valid inputs will always be provided as per the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
