Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number. The annotated version confirms that the function processes each digit of the input number, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and sums these values. The function then compares this sum to the original number, returning `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise. This logic aligns perfectly with the definition of an Armstrong number, and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation.
