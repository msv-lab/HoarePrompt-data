Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program attempts to verify if a given number is an Armstrong number by calculating the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number. However, the program incorrectly uses `num_len` (the length of the string representation of the number) as the exponent in the calculation, rather than the actual number of digits. This leads to incorrect results for numbers with more than one digit. 

For instance, for the number 1634, the program would calculate \(1^{4} + 6^{4} + 3^{4} + 4^{4}\) instead of \(1^{4} + 6^{4} + 3^{4} + 4^{4}\), which is incorrect. The correct implementation should directly use the length of the string representation of the number as the exponent. Since the current implementation fails to do this, the program does not meet the problem description correctly.
