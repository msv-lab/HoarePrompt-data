Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the Armstrong number check. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. However, the code raises each digit to the power of `num_len` (the total number of digits), instead of raising each digit to the power of the number of digits it represents. For example, for the number 153, which is an Armstrong number, the correct calculation should be \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3\), but the code calculates \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3\) as if there were four digits. This results in an incorrect evaluation for any three-digit Armstrong number.

For instance, for the number 153, the code will evaluate \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\), which is correct, but for the number 9474 (another Armstrong number), the code will incorrectly evaluate \(9^4 + 4^4 + 7^4 + 4^4\), leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case and thus is incorrect.
