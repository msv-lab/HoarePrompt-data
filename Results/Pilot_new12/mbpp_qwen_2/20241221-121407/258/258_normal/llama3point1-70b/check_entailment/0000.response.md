Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly check for Armstrong numbers. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

However, the program is raising each digit to the power of `num_len`, which is the length of the string representation of the number, not the actual number of digits. This means the program will fail for any number with more than one digit. For instance, for the number 1634 (which is an Armstrong number), the program would calculate \(1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4\) instead of \(1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4\), leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the exponent should be `len(num_str)` instead of `num_len`. However, since `num_len` is already correctly set to the length of the string representation of the number, the correct implementation should directly use `num_len` as the exponent.
