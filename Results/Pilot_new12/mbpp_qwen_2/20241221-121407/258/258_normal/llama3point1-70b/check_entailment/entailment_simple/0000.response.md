Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly checks whether the given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` as input, which matches the requirement.
2. It converts the integer to a string to iterate over each digit, calculates the length of the number (`num_len`), and initializes a sum variable.
3. It iterates over each digit, converting it back to an integer, raising it to the power of `num_len`, and adding it to the sum.
4. Finally, it compares the calculated sum with the original number and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that the number is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The logic implemented in the program aligns perfectly with the definition of an Armstrong number, which is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement.
