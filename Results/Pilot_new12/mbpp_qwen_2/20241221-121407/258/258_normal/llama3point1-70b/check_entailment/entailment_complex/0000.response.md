Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes an integer `num` as a parameter, as specified in the problem description.
2. It converts `num` into a string `num_str` and calculates the length of `num_str` (`num_len`), which matches the requirement.
3. It iterates over each digit in `num_str`, converting it back to an integer, raising it to the power of `num_len`, and adding the result to `sum`.
4. After processing all digits, it checks if `sum` equals the original `num` and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.
5. The function handles the edge case for `num` being 0 by returning `True` because \(0^0\) is considered 1 in this context.
6. The program assumes the input is valid (positive integer) as per the assumption given, and does not handle invalid inputs like negative numbers or non-integers, which aligns with the given instructions.

Thus, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all valid inputs.
