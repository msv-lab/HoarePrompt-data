Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits). The function converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this sum to the original number. This logic works for all potential cases, including edge cases like single-digit numbers (since \(n^n = n\) for any single-digit \(n\)). Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
