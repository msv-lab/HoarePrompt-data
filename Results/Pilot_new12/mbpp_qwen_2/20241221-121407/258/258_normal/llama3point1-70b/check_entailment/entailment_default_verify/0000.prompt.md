You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly check for Armstrong numbers. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

However, the program is raising each digit to the power of `num_len`, which is the length of the string representation of the number, not the actual number of digits. This means the program will fail for any number with more than one digit. For instance, for the number 1634 (which is an Armstrong number), the program would calculate \(1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4\) instead of \(1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4\), leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, the exponent should be `len(num_str)` instead of `num_len`. However, since `num_len` is already correctly set to the length of the string representation of the number, the correct implementation should directly use `num_len` as the exponent.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` as a parameter. It converts `num` into a string `num_str` and calculates the length of `num_str` as `num_len`. Then, it iterates through each digit of `num_str`, converting each digit back to an integer and raising it to the power of `num_len`. These values are summed up and stored in `sum`. After processing all digits, the function checks if `sum` equals the original `num`. If `sum` equals `num`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include: (1) If `num` is 0, the function should return `True` since 0^0 is considered 1 by convention in such contexts. (2) Negative numbers are not valid inputs for this function, and it will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert them to a string. The function does not handle non-integer inputs; such inputs will result in a `TypeError`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
