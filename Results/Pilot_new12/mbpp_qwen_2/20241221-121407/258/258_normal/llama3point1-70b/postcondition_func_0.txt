The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` as a parameter. It converts `num` into a string `num_str` and calculates the length of `num_str` as `num_len`. Then, it iterates through each digit of `num_str`, converting each digit back to an integer and raising it to the power of `num_len`. These values are summed up and stored in `sum`. After processing all digits, the function checks if `sum` equals the original `num`. If `sum` equals `num`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include: (1) If `num` is 0, the function should return `True` since 0^0 is considered 1 by convention in such contexts. (2) Negative numbers are not valid inputs for this function, and it will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert them to a string. The function does not handle non-integer inputs; such inputs will result in a `TypeError`.
