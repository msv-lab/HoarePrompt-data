#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is an integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is an integer, `num_str` is the empty string (after all digits are processed), `num_len` is 0, `sum` is the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.
    return sum == num
    #The program returns True if the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len` equals `num`, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer `num` as a parameter. It converts `num` into a string `num_str` and calculates the length of `num_str` as `num_len`. Then, it iterates through each digit of `num_str`, converting each digit back to an integer and raising it to the power of `num_len`. These values are summed up and stored in `sum`. After processing all digits, the function checks if `sum` equals the original `num`. If `sum` equals `num`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include: (1) If `num` is 0, the function should return `True` since 0^0 is considered 1 by convention in such contexts. (2) Negative numbers are not valid inputs for this function, and it will raise a `ValueError` when attempting to convert them to a string. The function does not handle non-integer inputs; such inputs will result in a `TypeError`.
