Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. The annotations in the annotated version of the code support this understanding. Specifically, the annotation:

- "State of the program right before the function call: n is a non-negative integer."
- "`The program returns True if the sum of each digit of n raised to the power of the number of digits in n is equal to n, otherwise False`"

These annotations align with the logic of the function, which converts the number to a string to get the length of the number, computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and then checks if this sum is equal to the original number. The provided test cases are also consistent with the definition of Armstrong numbers, confirming the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is maintained as the program is indeed correct based on the problem description and the provided code.
