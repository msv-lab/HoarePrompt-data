Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

Here's why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1` takes a single non-negative integer `n` as input. The problem description specifies that the function should accept a non-negative integer, which matches the function's input type.

2. **Logic Implementation**: 
   - Convert the number `n` to a string (`num_str`) to easily iterate over its digits.
   - Calculate the length of the string (`num_len`), which represents the number of digits in `n`.
   - Compute the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of `num_len`.
   - Check if this computed sum is equal to the original number `n`. If it is, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the edge case where `n` is 0 because \(0^1 = 0\). Additionally, the function implicitly does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs, as specified in the problem description and assumed in the context.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions verify that the function works as expected for the given test cases (153, 259, and 4458).

Since the function `func_1` accurately checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number according to the problem description, the program is correct.
