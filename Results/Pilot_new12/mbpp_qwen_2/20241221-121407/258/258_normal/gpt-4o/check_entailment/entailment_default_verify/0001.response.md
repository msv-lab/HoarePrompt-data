Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a given number is an Armstrong number. The output hints confirm that the function handles the basic requirement of checking Armstrong numbers and correctly identifies edge cases such as `n` being 0, although it does not explicitly handle negative numbers, which are not valid inputs as per the function definition. Since the problem description only requires handling non-negative integers and the provided test cases cover the necessary functionality, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
