Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) for every potential case. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function `func_1` handles this correctly:

- It converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
- It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
- It compares this sum to the original number and returns `True` if they are equal, otherwise `False`.

The provided assertions cover valid cases:
- `func_1(153)` returns `True` because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
- `func_1(259)` returns `False` because \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259\).
- `func_1(4458)` returns `False` because \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 \neq 4458\).

The code also handles the edge case of \(0\) correctly, as \(0^1 = 0\), although it is not explicitly checked in the provided code. Since the problem description and output hints do not indicate any specific issues with the implementation and all provided examples work as expected, the program is correct.
