Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1(n)` takes a single non-negative integer `n` as input.
2. **Conversion to String**: The number `n` is converted to a string using `str(n)`, which allows us to iterate over each digit.
3. **Length Calculation**: The length of the string representation of `n` is calculated using `len(num_str)`, which gives the number of digits in `n`.
4. **Armstrong Sum Calculation**: The sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the number of digits is computed using a generator expression inside the `sum()` function: `sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)`.
5. **Comparison and Return**: The function returns `True` if the computed sum is equal to `n`, indicating that `n` is an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The provided test cases:
- `assert func_1(153) == True`: 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
- `assert func_1(259) == False`: 259 is not an Armstrong number because \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259\).
- `assert func_1(4458) == False`: 4458 is not an Armstrong number because \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 \neq 4458\).

These tests confirm that the function behaves as expected for Armstrong and non-Armstrong numbers. Therefore, the program meets the problem description correctly.
