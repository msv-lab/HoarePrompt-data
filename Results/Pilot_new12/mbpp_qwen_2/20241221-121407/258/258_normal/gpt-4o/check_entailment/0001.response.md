Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. 

The function converts the number to a string to easily iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and then checks if this sum is equal to the original number. The provided test cases `func_1(153) == True`, `func_1(259) == False`, and `func_1(4458) == False` are all correct according to the definition of Armstrong numbers. 

- `153` is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).
- `259` is not an Armstrong number because \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259\).
- `4458` is not an Armstrong number because \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 \neq 4458\).

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the logic is sound, the function is correct for all potential cases of Armstrong number checking.
