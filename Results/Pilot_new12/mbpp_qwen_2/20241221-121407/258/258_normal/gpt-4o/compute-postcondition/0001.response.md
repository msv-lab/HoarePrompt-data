The code `num_len = len(num_str)` assigns the length of the string `num_str` to the variable `num_len`. The initial state is that `n` is a non-negative integer and `num_str` is the string representation of `n`. After executing this line of code, `num_len` will store the length of `num_str`, which is the number of digits in `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is the string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.**
