The code calculates the Armstrong sum (also known as the Narcissistic number) for the given number `n`. The Armstrong sum is calculated by taking each digit of `n`, raising it to the power of the number of digits in `n`, and then summing these values. The original values of `n`, `num_str`, and `num_len` remain unchanged, while a new variable `armstrong_sum` is created and updated with the calculated sum.

Let's break down the steps:

1. Convert `n` to its string representation `num_str`.
2. Determine the number of digits in `n`, which is stored in `num_len`.
3. Calculate `armstrong_sum` using a generator expression that iterates over each digit in `num_str`, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and sums these values.

After the code executes, the new variable `armstrong_sum` will hold the calculated sum, and the original variables `n`, `num_str`, and `num_len` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`, `armstrong_sum` is the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`.**
