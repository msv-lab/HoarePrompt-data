The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It calculates the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`. If this sum is equal to `n`, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include `n` being 0, where the function should return `True` since \(0^1 = 0\), and negative numbers, which are not valid inputs as per the function definition. The function does not handle these edge cases explicitly, so the final state of the program will be as described above.
