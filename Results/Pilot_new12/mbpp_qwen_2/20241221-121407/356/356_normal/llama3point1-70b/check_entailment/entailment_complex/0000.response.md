Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a string `input_str` and uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from it. This transformation ensures that the returned string contains no spaces, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to remove all whitespaces from a string. The explanation in the comments also accurately describes the functionality and potential edge cases, such as strings that are already free of spaces or strings consisting entirely of spaces. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
