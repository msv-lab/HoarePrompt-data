Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The annotated version confirms that the function operates as intended, returning a string without any spaces. Since the input is assumed to be valid and the function behaves as required, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
