Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. This method will replace all occurrences of the specified substring (in this case, a single space) with another substring (an empty string), effectively removing all whitespaces. Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases (it removes all whitespaces regardless of their quantity or position), the program is correct.
