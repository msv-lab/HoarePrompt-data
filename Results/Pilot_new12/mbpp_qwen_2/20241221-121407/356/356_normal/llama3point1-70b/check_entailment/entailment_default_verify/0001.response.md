Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description of removing all whitespaces from a string. The provided code uses the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of space characters from the input string, which aligns with the problem requirements. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling various edge cases such as strings with no spaces or consisting solely of spaces. Given the problem description and the functionality demonstrated by the code, the original assessment is accurate.
