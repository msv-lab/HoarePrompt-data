Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method, which meets the problem description. The function handles all potential cases, including:
- Input strings with multiple spaces.
- Input strings with leading or trailing spaces.
- Input strings with no spaces.
- Input strings consisting entirely of spaces (which results in an empty string).

Since the function works correctly for all mentioned cases and there are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases, the program is correct.
