Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The annotated version confirms that the function takes a string `input_str`, replaces all spaces with an empty string, and returns a new string without any spaces. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description of removing all whitespaces from a string. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities mentioned in the annotations that would indicate the function is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: **True** is justified.
