Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` takes a string `input_str` as input and uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the string. The function then returns the modified string without any spaces. This directly fulfills the requirement specified in the problem description, which states that the function should remove all whitespaces from a string. Since the function behaves as expected for any valid string input, it is correct according to the given problem description.
