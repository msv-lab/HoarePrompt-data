Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes a string (`input_str`) and returns a new string with all whitespaces removed using the `replace` method. Since the problem description requires a function to remove all whitespaces from a string, and the provided code and annotations clearly show that the function accomplishes this, the program is correct.
