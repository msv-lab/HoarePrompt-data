Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling various edge cases such as strings without spaces and strings consisting entirely of spaces. Since the function removes all spaces regardless of their quantity or position and there are no apparent issues or missing functionalities mentioned in the output hints, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
