The function `func_1` accepts a string `input_str` and returns a new string where all spaces have been removed. The function does this by using the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of space characters (' ') with an empty string. This transformation ensures that the returned string contains no spaces, regardless of their position in the original string. Potential edge cases include input strings that are already free of spaces, which will be returned unchanged, and input strings that consist entirely of spaces, which will result in an empty string upon return. There are no apparent missing functionalities in the provided code.
