#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')
    #The program returns the string `s` with all spaces removed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string with all spaces removed. The function uses the `replace` method to achieve this. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the annotation, but it's worth noting that the function handles strings correctly and will return an empty string if the input is an empty string. If the input string contains no spaces, the function will return the original string unchanged.
