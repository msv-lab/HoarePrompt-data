Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The examples given also demonstrate that the function works as expected for various cases, including multiple consecutive whitespaces and leading/trailing spaces. Since the function behaves correctly for all tested cases and the problem description only requires removing all whitespaces from a string, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
