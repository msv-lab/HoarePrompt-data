Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The assertions given in the problem description cover various cases, including multiple consecutive whitespaces and leading/trailing spaces. The function works as expected for these cases and handles them correctly. Since the problem description asks to remove all whitespaces from a string, and the function achieves this accurately for all the given examples, the code meets the requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
