Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works as expected for various cases, including strings with multiple consecutive whitespaces and leading/trailing spaces. Since the function meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment of True remains valid.
