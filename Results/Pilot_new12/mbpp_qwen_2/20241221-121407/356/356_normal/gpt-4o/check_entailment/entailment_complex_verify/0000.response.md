Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The annotated version confirms that the function handles strings appropriately and returns the expected results for the given test cases. The function works as intended for the provided inputs, including handling multiple consecutive whitespaces and leading/trailing spaces. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
