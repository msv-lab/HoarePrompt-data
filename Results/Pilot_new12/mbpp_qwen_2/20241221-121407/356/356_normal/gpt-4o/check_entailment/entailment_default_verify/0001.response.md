Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string in all the given test cases. The function uses the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of spaces with an empty string, which effectively removes all whitespaces. The output hints confirm that the function handles strings correctly, including strings with no spaces, multiple consecutive spaces, leading/trailing spaces, and an empty string. Since the function behaves as expected in all tested scenarios, it is reasonable to conclude that the function will work correctly for any input string without any whitespace.
