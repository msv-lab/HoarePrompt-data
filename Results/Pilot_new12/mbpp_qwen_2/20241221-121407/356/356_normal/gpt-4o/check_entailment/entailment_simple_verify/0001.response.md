Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string as demonstrated by the assertions. The annotated version confirms that the function takes a string `s` and returns it with all spaces removed using the `replace` method. Since the function behaves as expected in all provided test cases and the problem description requires removing all whitespaces from a string, the function satisfies the requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True remains valid.
