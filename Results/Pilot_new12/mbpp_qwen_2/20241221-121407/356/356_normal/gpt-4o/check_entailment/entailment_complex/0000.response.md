Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the string. The function correctly returns the modified string without any spaces.

The assertions in the annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios:
- It removes spaces from strings with leading and trailing spaces.
- It removes multiple consecutive spaces.
- It returns an empty string when the input string itself is empty.

Since the function consistently removes all whitespace characters from the input string, it fulfills the requirement of the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
