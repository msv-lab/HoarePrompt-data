Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string in all the given test cases. The function uses the `replace` method to replace all occurrences of spaces with an empty string. Given the nature of the `replace` method, it will handle multiple consecutive spaces and leading/trailing spaces as shown in the examples. Since the function behaves as expected in all tested scenarios, it is reasonable to conclude that the function will work correctly for any input string without any whitespace.
