Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to remove all whitespaces from a given string. The annotated program includes several test cases that demonstrate the function's behavior:

1. `func_1('python  program')` returns `'pythonprogram'`.
2. `func_1('python   programming    language')` returns `'pythonprogramminglanguage'`.
3. `func_1('python                     program')` returns `'pythonprogram'`.
4. `func_1('   python                     program')` returns `'pythonprogram'`.

In each case, the function successfully removes all spaces from the input string, which aligns with the problem description to remove all whitespaces from a string. The implementation uses the `replace` method, which correctly removes all occurrences of spaces in the string. Since the program consistently performs as required across the given test cases, it can be considered correct.
