Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the goal is to write a function that removes all whitespaces from a string. The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `replace` method to achieve this. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function works as intended for various cases, including strings with multiple consecutive spaces, leading spaces, trailing spaces, and an empty string. The function returns the correct results for the given test cases, and there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
