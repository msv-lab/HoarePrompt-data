Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for various cases, including strings with multiple consecutive whitespaces and those with leading or trailing spaces. Additionally, the function returns the original string if there are no spaces to remove, and it correctly handles an empty string. Since the problem description only requires removing all whitespaces from a string, and the function satisfies this requirement, the original assessment is correct.
