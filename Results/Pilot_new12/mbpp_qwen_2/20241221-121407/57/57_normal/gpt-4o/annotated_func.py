#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of sorted sublists where each sublist is from the original `list_of_lists`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. It returns a new list of sublists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The sorting is performed in-place for each sublist within the returned list. The original `list_of_lists` is not modified. Any potential edge cases, such as empty sublists or the entire `list_of_lists` being empty, are handled correctly, and the function will return an appropriately sorted list of sublists. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.
