Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. It returns a new list of sublists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The sorting is performed in-place for each sublist within the returned list. The original `list_of_lists` is not modified. Any potential edge cases, such as empty sublists or the entire `list_of_lists` being empty, are handled correctly, and the function will return an appropriately sorted list of sublists. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.**
