Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists as described in the problem statement. The function uses list comprehension to apply the `sorted()` function to each sublist, ensuring that each sublist is sorted alphabetically. The output hints confirm that the function handles various scenarios, including sublists of different lengths and those with leading/trailing spaces, without modification to the original `list_of_lists`. The function also correctly handles edge cases such as empty sublists and the entire `list_of_lists` being empty. Given that the assertions cover multiple test cases and the provided code logic is sound, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
