Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to apply the `sorted()` function to each sublist. This approach ensures that each sublist is sorted alphabetically, which satisfies the problem description.

Since the provided assertions cover different scenarios (including sublists of varying lengths and containing strings with leading/trailing spaces), and the function works correctly in these cases, we can conclude that the function handles all potential cases as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
