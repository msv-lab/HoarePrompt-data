Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input, where each inner list contains strings, and it sorts each of these inner lists in ascending order. The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and applies the `sorted()` function to sort the elements of the sublist. Finally, it returns a new list containing the sorted sublists.

The provided test cases verify that the function correctly sorts each sublist of strings:
- The first test case sorts `['green', 'orange']`, `['black', 'white']`, and `['white', 'black', 'orange']` into `['green', 'orange']`, `['black', 'white']`, and `['black', 'orange', 'white']` respectively.
- The second test case sorts `[' red ', 'green']`, `['blue ', ' black']`, and `[' orange', 'brown']` into `[' red ', 'green']`, `[' black', 'blue ']`, and `[' orange', 'brown']` respectively.
- The third test case sorts `['zilver', 'gold']`, `['magnesium', 'aluminium']`, and `['steel', 'bronze']` into `['gold', 'zilver']`, `['aluminium', 'magnesium']`, and `['bronze', 'steel']` respectively.

Since the function performs the required operation of sorting each sublist of strings and the test cases confirm this behavior, the program is correct according to the problem description.
