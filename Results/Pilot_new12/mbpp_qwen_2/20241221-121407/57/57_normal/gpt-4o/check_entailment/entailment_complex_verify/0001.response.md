Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The annotations confirm that the function takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of sorted sublists without modifying the original input. The provided test cases in the assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected across various scenarios, including handling leading/trailing spaces in the strings (e.g., `' red '` and `' black '`). The annotated version also notes that the function handles potential edge cases correctly, such as empty sublists or the entire `list_of_lists` being empty. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness remains valid.
