You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and apply the `sorted()` function to sort the elements within each sublist. All the provided test cases demonstrate that the function works as expected:

1. `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])` sorts to `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`.
2. `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])` sorts to `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`.
3. `(['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])` sorts to `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`.

Since the function handles the given examples correctly and the sorting logic is straightforward, there are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function is correct according to the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. It returns a new list of sublists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The sorting is performed in-place for each sublist within the returned list. The original `list_of_lists` is not modified. Any potential edge cases, such as empty sublists or the entire `list_of_lists` being empty, are handled correctly, and the function will return an appropriately sorted list of sublists. There are no missing functionalities noted in the provided code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
