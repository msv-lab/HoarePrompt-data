Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. The annotations support this correctness by clearly stating that the function returns a list of sorted sublists, where each sublist is from the original `list_of_lists`. The provided assertions cover different scenarios, including sublists of varying lengths and strings with leading/trailing spaces, ensuring that the function handles all potential cases as expected. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
