Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists containing strings and returns a new list of sublists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The provided assertions cover different scenarios, including sublists of varying lengths and strings with leading/trailing spaces. The annotated version correctly describes the function's behavior, stating that it returns a new list of sorted sublists without modifying the original `list_of_lists`. Additionally, the annotated version notes that the function handles potential edge cases correctly, ensuring the output is appropriately sorted. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
