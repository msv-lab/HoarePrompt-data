Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (where each inner list contains strings) and returns a new list of sublists where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description states that the input should be a list of lists containing strings. The provided function `func_1` does not explicitly validate the input type; however, the problem statement assumes valid input, so this is acceptable under the given conditions.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The function uses a list comprehension with the `sorted()` function to sort each sublist in place. This means that the original structure of the list (i.e., list of lists) is preserved, and each sublist is sorted independently.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function handles various edge cases correctly:
   - Empty sublists: If a sublist is empty, `sorted([])` returns an empty list, which is correct.
   - Entire `list_of_lists` being empty: If `list_of_lists` itself is an empty list, the function returns an empty list, which is also correct.

4. **No Modification of Original Data**: The function does not modify the original `list_of_lists`; instead, it returns a new list with sorted sublists.

Given these points, the program always meets the requirements specified in the problem description, making it correct.
