Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function to sort the elements within each sublist. All the provided test cases in the assertions demonstrate that the function works as expected. Since the function handles the given examples correctly and the sorting logic is straightforward, there are no apparent edge cases or issues that would cause the function to fail. Therefore, the function is correct according to the provided problem description.
