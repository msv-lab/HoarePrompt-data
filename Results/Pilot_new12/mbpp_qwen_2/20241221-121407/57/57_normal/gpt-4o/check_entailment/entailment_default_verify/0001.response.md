Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings within the given list of lists. The provided output hints confirm that the function handles the sorting in the expected manner, without modifying the original `list_of_lists`. The function also handles edge cases such as empty sublists and the entire `list_of_lists` being empty, returning an appropriately sorted list of sublists. Since the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and all test cases pass, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
