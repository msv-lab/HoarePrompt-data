Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The `func_1` function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and apply the `sorted` function to sort the elements in ascending order. The output hints also confirm that the function handles edge cases like empty sublists and the entire `list_of_lists` being empty correctly. Given the examples and the problem description, the code appears to meet all requirements for every potential case.
