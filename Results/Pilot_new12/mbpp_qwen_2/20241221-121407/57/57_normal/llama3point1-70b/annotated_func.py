#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #A list of lists where each inner list is sorted in alphabetical order, ignoring case sensitivity
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. It returns a new list of lists where each inner list is sorted in alphabetical order, ignoring case sensitivity. This is achieved by using a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`, sorting each sublist based on the lowercase version of its string elements. The function handles both empty sublists and sublists containing a single element. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases present in the provided code.
