Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each sublist and applies the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` to ensure case-insensitive sorting. This approach handles all potential cases where sublists contain strings and should work correctly for any input that fits the problem description. Since no specific edge cases or examples were provided that could cause the program to fail, we can conclude that the program meets the requirements for all potential cases.
