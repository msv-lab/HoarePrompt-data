Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists using `str.lower` as the key for sorting, ensuring case-insensitive sorting. The use of a list comprehension to apply the `sorted` function to each sublist ensures that the program works correctly for all given inputs and potential cases, as described in the problem statement. The output hints further confirm that the function handles both empty sublists and sublists containing a single element, indicating that there are no missing functionalities or edge cases present in the provided code. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
