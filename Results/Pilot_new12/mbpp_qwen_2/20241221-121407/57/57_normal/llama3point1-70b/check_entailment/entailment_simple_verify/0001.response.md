Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists using `str.lower` as the key for sorting, ensuring case-insensitive sorting. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a list of sorted sublists, where each sublist is sorted in alphabetical order, ignoring case sensitivity. Given the problem description and the annotated version, the function meets the requirements and performs the intended operation correctly.
