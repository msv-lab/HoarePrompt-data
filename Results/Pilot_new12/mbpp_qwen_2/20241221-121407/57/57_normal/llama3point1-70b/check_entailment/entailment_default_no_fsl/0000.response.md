Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists, ignoring case sensitivity. The list comprehension iterates over each sublist, sorts it using `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)`, and returns a new list of these sorted sublists. The code handles edge cases such as empty sublists and sublists with a single element. Since the problem description does not specify any other requirements or potential edge cases that the code is not handling, and the provided output hints confirm that the code works as expected for all described cases, the code is correct.
