Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings. It returns a new list of lists where each inner list is sorted in alphabetical order, ignoring case sensitivity. This is achieved by using a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and sorting each sublist based on the lowercase version of its string elements. The function handles both empty sublists and sublists containing a single element, as required by the problem description. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases present in the provided code, and the program meets all the specified requirements.
