Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists using `str.lower` as the key for sorting, ensuring case-insensitive sorting. The annotated version confirms that the function handles both empty sublists and sublists containing a single element, and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases present in the provided code. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
