Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code functionality. The program `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists using case-insensitive sorting. The output hints confirm that the function handles both empty sublists and sublists containing a single element, and there are no mentioned edge cases or functionalities that the code is missing. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** stands valid.
