Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program `func_1` meets the problem description. The annotated version further clarifies that the function `func_1` takes a list of lists of strings and returns a new list of lists where each inner list is sorted in alphabetical order, ignoring case sensitivity. The use of `str.lower` as the key in the `sorted` function ensures case-insensitive sorting, which aligns with the problem description. The annotated version also mentions that the function handles both empty sublists and sublists containing a single element, indicating that there are no missing functionalities or edge cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the given problem description.
