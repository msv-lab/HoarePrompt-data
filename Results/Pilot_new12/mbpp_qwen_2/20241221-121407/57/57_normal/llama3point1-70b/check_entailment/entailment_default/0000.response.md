Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, ignoring case sensitivity. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and sorts each sublist using the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower`. This ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. The code handles both empty sublists and sublists containing a single element, as well as sublists containing multiple strings. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases present in the provided code, and the output hints agree with the functionality of the code. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
