Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists using `str.lower` as the key for sorting. This ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. Since the function uses a list comprehension to apply the `sorted` function to each sublist, it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program works correctly for all given inputs and potential cases.
