Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes that the input will be a valid list of lists, containing strings. The function does not explicitly validate this, but as per the instructions, we are assuming valid input. Therefore, the function adheres to the problem description without needing to handle invalid inputs.

2. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists where each inner list contains strings. It returns a new list of lists where each inner list (sublist) is sorted alphabetically, ignoring case sensitivity.

3. **Sorting Logic**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in `list_of_lists`. For each sublist, it applies the `sorted()` function with `key=str.lower`. This ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive because `str.lower` converts each string to lowercase for comparison purposes during sorting.

4. **Output Format**: The output is a list of lists, where each inner list is sorted alphabetically. This matches the expected output described in the problem statement.

Since the function correctly implements the required behavior for all valid cases, the program is correct according to the problem description.
