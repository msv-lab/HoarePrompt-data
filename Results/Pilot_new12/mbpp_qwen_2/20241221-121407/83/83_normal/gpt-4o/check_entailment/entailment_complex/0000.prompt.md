You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Annotated Functions:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements (can be of any comparable type).
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements where the largest element is at the last position, `n` is the length of the original array, and `curr_size` is 2.
    return arr
    #The program returns the list 'arr' where the largest element is at the last position
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` as a parameter and ensures that the largest element in the list is moved to the last position. It achieves this by iterating over the list from the second-largest element to the first, finding the index of the current maximum element, and swapping it with the current element if necessary. After the loop completes, the function returns the modified list `arr`. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with only one element, in which case the function would return the list unchanged. The function also assumes that the list contains elements that can be compared.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and end is an integer such that 0 <= end < len(arr), representing the last index of the sublist to be sorted.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to `end` + 1, `end` is equal to the original value of `end` which satisfies \(0 \leq \text{end} < \text{len(arr)}\), and `arr` is reversed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `flip` takes an integer `end` as a parameter, where `0 <= end < len(arr)` and `arr` is a list of elements. It reverses the sublist of `arr` from index `0` to `end` (inclusive). After the function executes, `arr` will have its elements in reverse order from index `0` to `end`, while the rest of the list remains unchanged. If `end` is 0 or negative, the function will do nothing because the loop condition `start < end` will never be met. The function does not return any value.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of comparable elements (e.g., integers, floats, strings), and n is an integer representing the length of the list such that 1 <= n <= len(arr).
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(arr), `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` (if such an element exists), otherwise `max_index` remains 0.
    return max_index
    #`The program returns max_index which is the index of the maximum element in `arr` if such an element exists, otherwise it remains 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `find_max_index` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `arr` and returns the index of the maximum element in `arr` if such an element exists. If no maximum element is found, it returns 0. The function iterates through the list `arr` starting from index 1 up to `n-1` to find the maximum element. If the list is empty (i.e., `n` is less than 1), the function would not enter the loop and `max_index` would remain 0, satisfying the postcondition. However, since the precondition ensures `1 <= n <= len(arr)`, this edge case is covered within the given constraints.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
