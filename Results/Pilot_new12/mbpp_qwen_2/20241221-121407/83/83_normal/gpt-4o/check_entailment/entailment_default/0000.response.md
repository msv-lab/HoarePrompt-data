Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly sort the list as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` is intended to sort a list by repeatedly moving the maximum element to the end of the list until the entire list is sorted. However, the implementation has a flaw: it only checks for the maximum element in the current unsorted portion of the list and moves it to the end without ensuring that the list is sorted in ascending order.

To illustrate, consider the list `[41, 42, 32, 12, 23]`. The function `find_max_index` will correctly find the index of the maximum element, but the subsequent `flip` operations will not necessarily place the maximum element in its correct position. For example, after the first iteration, the list becomes `[42, 41, 32, 12, 23]`, but the next iteration will incorrectly place the maximum element in an incorrect position.

A correct sorting algorithm would ensure that the list is sorted in ascending order, which this code does not achieve. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
