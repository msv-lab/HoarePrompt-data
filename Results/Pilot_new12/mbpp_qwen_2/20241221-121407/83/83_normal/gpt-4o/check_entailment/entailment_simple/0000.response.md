Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement a sorting algorithm as described in the problem statement. The problem description asks for a function that sorts a list of elements. However, the given implementation uses a selection sort-like approach with two helper functions (`find_max_index` and `flip`) that do not achieve the desired result of fully sorting the list.

Here's why the program is incorrect:

1. **Selection Sort-like Approach**: 
   - The `func_1` function iterates over the array from the second last element to the first element. For each element, it finds the maximum element in the remaining unsorted portion of the array using `find_max_index`.
   - It then swaps this maximum element with the current element. This process ensures that the largest element moves to the end of the unsorted portion of the array in each iteration.

2. **Partial Sorting**:
   - While this approach partially sorts the array (the largest element is moved to the end of the unsorted portion), it does not ensure that the entire array is sorted. After one pass through the array, the largest element is at the end, but the rest of the array may still be unsorted.

3. **Incorrect Implementation**:
   - The problem description implies that the function should fully sort the list, but the provided implementation only places the largest element in its correct position without ensuring the rest of the array is sorted.

A correct solution would involve iterating over the array multiple times until all elements are in their correct positions, ensuring the entire array is sorted. The provided code only performs a single pass through the array, which is insufficient for fully sorting the list.

For example, consider the following test case:
```python
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 1, 5, 6])
```
- After the first pass, the largest element `9` is moved to the last position: `[5, 2, 1, 5, 6, 9]`.
- The rest of the array remains unsorted, and no subsequent passes are performed to sort these elements.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement of fully sorting the list as specified in the problem description, making it incorrect.
