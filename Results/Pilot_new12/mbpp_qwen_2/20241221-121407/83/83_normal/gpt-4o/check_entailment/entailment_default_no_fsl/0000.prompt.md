You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Functions with output description for each function:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(arr):


    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` as a parameter and ensures that the largest element in the list is moved to the last position. It achieves this by iterating over the list from the second-largest element to the first, finding the index of the current maximum element, and swapping it with the current element if necessary. After the loop completes, the function returns the modified list `arr`. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with only one element, in which case the function would return the list unchanged. The function also assumes that the list contains elements that can be compared.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `flip` takes an integer `end` as a parameter, where `0 <= end < len(arr)` and `arr` is a list of elements. It reverses the sublist of `arr` from index `0` to `end` (inclusive). After the function executes, `arr` will have its elements in reverse order from index `0` to `end`, while the rest of the list remains unchanged. If `end` is 0 or negative, the function will do nothing because the loop condition `start < end` will never be met. The function does not return any value.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function `find_max_index` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `arr` and returns the index of the maximum element in `arr` if such an element exists. If no maximum element is found, it returns 0. The function iterates through the list `arr` starting from index 1 up to `n-1` to find the maximum element. If the list is empty (i.e., `n` is less than 1), the function would not enter the loop and `max_index` would remain 0, satisfying the postcondition. However, since the precondition ensures `1 <= n <= len(arr)`, this edge case is covered within the given constraints.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
