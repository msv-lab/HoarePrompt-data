Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided code does not guarantee a fully sorted array after the given operations. The `func_1` function attempts to sort the array by repeatedly finding the maximum element and flipping it to the end of the unsorted portion of the array. However, this approach fails to sort the entire array correctly. 

For example, consider the array `[3, 2, 4, 5]`:
- In the first iteration, `find_max_index` returns `3` (the index of `5`), and `flip(3)` and `flip(3)` do nothing since the last element is already in place. The array remains `[3, 2, 4, 5]`.
- In the second iteration, `find_max_index` returns `2` (the index of `4`), and `flip(2)` and `flip(3)` will swap `4` and `5`, resulting in `[3, 2, 5, 4]`.

This demonstrates that the array is not sorted after the operation. The `find_max_index` function works correctly by finding the maximum element and returning its index, and the `flip` function correctly swaps the elements. However, the overall logic of the `func_1` function does not ensure that the array is sorted after the specified operations. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
