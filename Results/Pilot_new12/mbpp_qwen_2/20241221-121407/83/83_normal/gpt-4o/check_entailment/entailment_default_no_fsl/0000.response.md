Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the sorting logic as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` aims to sort the list by moving the largest element to the end of the list repeatedly. However, the implementation does not fully achieve this goal. Instead, it uses the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions to swap elements in a way that does not guarantee a full sort.

For instance, consider the following case:
- Input: `[2, 3, 1]`
- Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3]`

However, the provided code will not produce the correct output for this case. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of what happens with the given code:

1. For `arr = [2, 3, 1]`:
   - `curr_size = 3`: No change needed since the largest element is already at the end.
   - `curr_size = 2`: Finds the max index of `[2, 3]` which is 1 (element 3).
     - Swap max_index (1) with `curr_size - 1` (1), resulting in `[2, 3, 1]`.
   - `curr_size = 1`: No change needed since the list has only one element.

Thus, the final output remains `[2, 3, 1]`, which is not sorted.

This shows that the provided code does not correctly sort the list as required, hence the correctness is **False**.
