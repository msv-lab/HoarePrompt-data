Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code attempts to sort an array using a series of flips, but there are several issues with the logic:

1. **Incorrect Range in `func_1`:** The loop in `func_1` starts from `n` and goes down to `2` (exclusive). This means the first iteration considers the entire array, which is unnecessary since sorting would already be completed after the first iteration if the array were sorted initially. Moreover, the `max_index` and `flip` operations do not necessarily sort the array correctly. 

2. **Potential Sorting Issue:** The algorithm seems to be attempting to sort the array by finding the maximum element and flipping it to its correct position in each pass. However, this approach might not always work correctly, especially if the array is not already close to being sorted. For instance, consider an array `[3, 2, 1]`. The first iteration will swap the maximum (3) with the last element (1), resulting in `[1, 2, 3]`, which is sorted. But consider an array like `[2, 3, 1]`. The first iteration will swap the maximum (3) with the last element (1), resulting in `[2, 1, 3]`, and the second iteration will swap the maximum (3) with the last element (3), resulting in `[2, 1, 3]`, which is not fully sorted.

3. **No Handling of Already Sorted Arrays:** The provided code does not handle cases where the array is already sorted. For such arrays, the `func_1` function would still perform unnecessary operations, which might lead to inefficiency but not necessarily incorrectness. However, the primary issue is that the algorithm does not guarantee correct sorting for arbitrary input arrays.

Given these points, the provided code does not guarantee correct sorting for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
