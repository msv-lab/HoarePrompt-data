The function `flip` takes an integer `end` as a parameter, where `0 <= end < len(arr)` and `arr` is a list of elements. It reverses the sublist of `arr` from index `0` to `end` (inclusive). After the function executes, `arr` will have its elements in reverse order from index `0` to `end`, while the rest of the list remains unchanged. If `end` is 0 or negative, the function will do nothing because the loop condition `start < end` will never be met. The function does not return any value.
