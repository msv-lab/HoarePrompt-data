The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` as a parameter and ensures that the largest element in the list is moved to the last position. It achieves this by iterating over the list from the second-largest element to the first, finding the index of the current maximum element, and swapping it with the current element if necessary. After the loop completes, the function returns the modified list `arr`. Potential edge cases include an empty list or a list with only one element, in which case the function would return the list unchanged. The function also assumes that the list contains elements that can be compared.
