The code initializes `max_index` to 0. This does not change the value of `arr` or `n`. The output state includes the updated value of `max_index` and retains the initial values of `arr` and `n`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list such that 1 <= n <= len(arr), `max_index` is 0**
