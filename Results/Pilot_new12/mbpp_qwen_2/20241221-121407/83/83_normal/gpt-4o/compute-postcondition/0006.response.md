The code `max_index = i` assigns the value of `i` to `max_index`. Given the initial state where `max_index` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `arr[0]` (or 0 if no such element exists), and `i` is 2, the value of `max_index` is updated to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` must be greater than 1, `max_index` is 2, `i` is 2**
