Functionality: **The function `find_max_index` accepts an integer `n` representing the length of a list `arr` and returns the index of the maximum element in `arr` if such an element exists. If no maximum element is found, it returns 0. The function iterates through the list `arr` starting from index 1 up to `n-1` to find the maximum element. If the list is empty (i.e., `n` is less than 1), the function would not enter the loop and `max_index` would remain 0, satisfying the postcondition. However, since the precondition ensures `1 <= n <= len(arr)`, this edge case is covered within the given constraints.**

**The function performs the following actions:**
- Initializes `max_index` to 0.
- Iterates through the list `arr` from index 1 to `n-1`.
- Updates `max_index` whenever it finds an element greater than the current `arr[max_index]`.

**After the function concludes, the state of the program is:**
- The function returns `max_index`, which is the index of the maximum element in `arr` if such an element exists; otherwise, it returns 0.
