Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of comparable elements.
   - `n` is greater than 1.
   - `max_index` is set to 2 if `arr[2]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`, otherwise `max_index` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is set to 3.

2. **Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, n)`.
   - This means `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`.

3. **Current Value of Variables:**
   - `i` is currently 3.
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 4 (since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time).

4. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` needs to be incremented to 4.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `max_index` does not change within the loop unless it is explicitly updated inside the loop body, but since no update is mentioned, we assume it remains unchanged.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 1, `max_index` is set to 2 if `arr[2]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`, otherwise `max_index` remains unchanged, `i` is 4**
