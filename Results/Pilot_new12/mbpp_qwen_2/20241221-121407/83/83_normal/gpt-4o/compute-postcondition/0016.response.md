Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `n-2` elements of `arr`, `curr_size` is `n-2`, and the element at index `n-3` has been flipped. If the maximum element in the first `n-2` elements is not at index `n-3`, then `max_index` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `max_index` is updated to the new index of the maximum element in the first `n-2` elements.***
