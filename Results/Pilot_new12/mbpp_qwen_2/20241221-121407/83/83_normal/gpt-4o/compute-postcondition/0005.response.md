According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `1` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 1, and `max_index` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `arr[0]` (if such an element exists; otherwise, `max_index` remains 0).

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must still be less than `n`. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2` (since it starts from `1` and increments by `1`), and `n` must remain greater than `1`.

Given that `max_index` was determined based on the initial conditions and the first iteration, its value does not change within the loop itself unless explicitly modified within the loop body. Since no modification to `max_index` is mentioned, we assume it remains the same.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect `i` being incremented to `2` and `n` still being greater than `1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` must be greater than 1, `max_index` is the index of the first element in `arr` that is greater than `arr[0]` (if such an element exists). If no such element exists, `max_index` remains 0, `i` is 2**
