State before the loop starts: `arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is an integer representing the length of the list such that 1 <= n <= len(arr), `max_index` is 0.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The for loop iterates from `1` to `n-1` (inclusive) because the range function generates values from the start value (1) up to but not including the stop value (`n`).

2. **Loop Execution Conditions**: For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `1` (since the loop starts from `1`).

3. **Initial State of Variables**:
   - `arr`: The list is already given as a list of comparable elements.
   - `n`: The length of the list `arr` is represented by `n`, and we know `1 <= n <= len(arr)`.
   - `max_index`: This variable is initially set to `0`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `n` must be greater than `1`. If `n` were `1`, the loop would not run because the range from `1` to `1` would generate no values.
   - `i` should be set to `1` at the beginning of the first iteration of the loop, as the loop starts iterating from `1`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the state for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than `1`.
- `i` should be `1` at the start of the loop.

State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` must be greater than 1, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1**
