Let's analyze the given loop and determine its output state after all iterations have finished.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `curr_size` in reverse order from `n` to `2` (inclusive). For each iteration:
1. It finds the index of the maximum element in the current subarray of size `curr_size`.
2. If the maximum element is not at the last position of the current subarray (`curr_size - 1`), it swaps the elements at the `max_index` and `curr_size - 1`.

### Iterations:
- **After 1 iteration**:
  - `arr` is a list of elements.
  - If `max_index` is not equal to `curr_size - 1`, the elements at `max_index` and `curr_size - 1` are swapped.
  - `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.
  - `curr_size` is still `n`.
  - `max_index` is updated to `curr_size - 1`.

- **After 2 iterations**:
  - `arr` is a list of elements.
  - If the element at index `max_index` is not the last element in the first `n-1` elements, then the element at index `max_index` is flipped.
  - `max_index` is updated to the index of the maximum element in the first `n-1` elements of `arr`.
  - `curr_size` is `n-1`.
  - The element at index `n-2` is flipped.

- **After 3 iterations**:
  - `arr` is a list of elements.
  - `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the first `n-2` elements of `arr`.
  - `curr_size` is `n-2`.
  - The element at index `n-3` has been flipped.
  - If the maximum element in the first `n-2` elements is not at index `n-3`, then `max_index` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `max_index` is updated to the new index of the maximum element in the first `n-2` elements.

### General Pattern:
From the pattern observed, we can deduce that after all iterations of the loop, the largest element in the array will be moved to the end of the array. This process continues until `curr_size` reaches 2, meaning the array is reduced to its first two elements. At this point, the remaining operations will ensure the largest of these two elements is moved to the end.

### Final Output State:
- `arr` is a list of elements where the largest element is guaranteed to be at the last position.
- `n` remains the length of the original array.
- `curr_size` will be 2, indicating the array has been reduced to its first two elements.

### Conclusion:
After the loop completes, the array `arr` will be such that the largest element is in the last position, and `n` will still be the length of the original array.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements where the largest element is at the last position, `n` is the length of the original array, and `curr_size` is 2.**
