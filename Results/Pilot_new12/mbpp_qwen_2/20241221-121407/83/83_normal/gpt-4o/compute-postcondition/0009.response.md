The code assigns the value of `i` (which is 4) to `max_index`. Initially, `max_index` was set to 2 if `arr[2]` was greater than `arr[max_index]`, but now it is explicitly set to 4. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of comparable elements, `n` is greater than 1, `max_index` is 4, `i` is 4**
