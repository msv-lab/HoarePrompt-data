Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the sorting functionality as described in the problem statement. The code aims to sort the list in non-increasing order, but it does not achieve this correctly. Specifically, the logic inside the loop is flawed:

1. The code finds the index of the maximum element in the current subarray (`arr[:size]`) and checks if it needs to be moved.
2. If the maximum element is not already at the front of the current subarray, it reverses parts of the array to move the maximum element to the front.

However, reversing parts of the array does not guarantee that the list will be sorted correctly. For example, consider the list `[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]`. The code will incorrectly sort this list because it only ensures that the maximum element in the current subarray is moved to the front, without considering the relative order of other elements.

To illustrate, let's walk through the code with the list `[3, 5, 4, 2, 1]`:

- For `size = 5`: The maximum element is 5, which is already at the front, so no action is taken.
- For `size = 4`: The maximum element is 5, which is at the front, so no action is taken.
- For `size = 3`: The maximum element is 4, which is not at the front. The code reverses the first 4 elements: `[4, 5, 3, 2, 1]`.
- For `size = 2`: The maximum element is 5, which is not at the front. The code reverses the first 2 elements: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`.
- For `size = 1`: The maximum element is 5, which is at the front, so no action is taken.

The final list is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order but not in non-increasing order as required.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description and hence is incorrect.
