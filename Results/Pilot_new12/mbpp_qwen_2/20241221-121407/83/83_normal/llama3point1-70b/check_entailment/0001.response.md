Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function does not correctly sort the list as described. The logic inside the loop attempts to reverse parts of the array but does not ensure that the elements are placed in their correct positions according to their values. For instance, consider the input `[3, 2, 1]`. The function will not sort this list correctly because the logic does not place the maximum element at its correct position in each pass. A correct sorting algorithm would place the largest unsorted element in its correct position after each iteration, which this function does not achieve.
