Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotated version, the function `func_1` sorts the list in non-increasing order, but the original problem description asks for a function that sorts the list in non-decreasing order. The annotated version states that the function sorts the list in non-increasing order, which means that while the list is sorted, it is not sorted in the way the problem description requires. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description. The original assessment is accurate in this regard.
