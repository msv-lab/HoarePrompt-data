Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` accepts a single argument `arr`, which is expected to be a non-empty list. The problem description states that the function should accept a non-empty list, which is consistent.

2. **Sorting Mechanism**: The function iterates over the list `arr` from the largest possible size (the full list) down to 1. For each iteration, it finds the maximum element in the current subarray and places it at the beginning of the subarray. This is done using the `max` function and the `index` method to find the position of the maximum element.

3. **Adjusting Subarrays**: After finding the maximum element in the subarray, the function checks if the index of the maximum element is not at the end of the subarray. If it is not, the function reverses the portion of the array up to the index of the maximum element to bring the maximum element to the front. Then, it reverses the entire subarray to place the maximum element correctly.

4. **Final State**: After the loop completes, the entire list `arr` is sorted in non-increasing order. The function ensures that the first `n` elements (where `n` is the length of the list) are in their final sorted order. This meets the requirement stated in the problem description.

5. **Edge Cases**: The function handles potential edge cases such as lists with duplicate maximum values. In such cases, the function still sorts the list correctly because the maximum element is placed at the beginning of the subarray, ensuring the list remains sorted in non-increasing order.

6. **Assumptions**: The problem description assumes valid inputs, which means the input list is non-empty. The function does not handle empty lists, and attempting to pass an empty list would indeed result in an `IndexError`. However, since the problem description states this assumption, the function is considered correct under these conditions.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the sorting logic described in the problem statement and meets all the specified requirements. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
