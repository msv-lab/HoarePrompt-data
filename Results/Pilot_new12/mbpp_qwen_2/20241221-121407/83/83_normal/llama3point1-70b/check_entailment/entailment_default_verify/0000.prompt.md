You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
    return arr


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program attempts to sort a list by repeatedly finding the maximum element and moving it to its correct position. However, this approach does not guarantee a fully sorted list. Specifically, consider the following example:

- Input: `[3, 2, 4, 5, 1]`
- Expected output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
- Actual output: The program might not sort the array correctly because it only ensures that the maximum element in the current unsorted portion is moved to its correct position without ensuring the entire array is sorted.

For instance, after the first iteration, the array could become `[1, 2, 4, 5, 3]`, but the final position of `3` is not guaranteed to be in the correct place. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for sorting the entire list correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list `arr` of elements (which can be integers, floats, or strings). It iterates through the list from the largest possible size down to 1, finding the maximum element in each subarray and adjusting the list to ensure that the maximum element is moved to the front of the current subarray. This process continues until the entire list is sorted in non-increasing order. Specifically, the function ensures that the first `n` elements of the list (`n` being the length of the list) are in their final sorted order. The function does not modify the original list but returns a new list that meets these criteria. Potential edge cases include lists with duplicate maximum values, where the function will still sort the list correctly. The function does not handle empty lists; attempting to pass an empty list will result in an error since `len(arr)` would be 0, leading to an `IndexError`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
