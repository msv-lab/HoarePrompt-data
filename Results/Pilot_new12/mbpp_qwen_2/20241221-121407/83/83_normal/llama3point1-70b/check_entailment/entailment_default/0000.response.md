Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the sorting of a list. The function `func_1` attempts to sort the list in non-increasing order, but the logic inside the loop is flawed. Specifically, the line `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses only the part of the list up to `max_index`, and then the next line `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the first `size` elements, which can lead to incorrect ordering. For instance, consider the list `[1, 2, 3]`. The function will not correctly sort this list into `[3, 2, 1]` because the reversal operations do not maintain the correct order. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirement to sort the list in every potential case.
