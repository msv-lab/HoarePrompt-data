Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotated version and the original assessment, the function `func_1` does not correctly sort the list as required by the problem description. The annotated version states that the program sorts the list in non-increasing order after the for loop has been executed. However, the original assessment correctly notes that the function does not place the maximum element at its correct position in each pass, which is a fundamental requirement for a correct sorting algorithm. While the annotated version suggests that the list is sorted in non-increasing order, it does not address the issue of the function not performing a proper sorting operation as defined by the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
