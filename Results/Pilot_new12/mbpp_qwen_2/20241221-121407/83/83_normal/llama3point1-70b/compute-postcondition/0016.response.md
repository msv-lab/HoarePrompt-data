The code `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:n]))` finds the index of the maximum value in the sublist `arr[:n]`. The `max_index` variable is updated with this index. 

- If `max_index` was previously equal to -1, the postcondition remains unchanged, meaning `max_index` remains -1.
- If `max_index` was not equal to -1, it could have been updated, but we don't know the exact value before unless specified.

The other variables (`arr`, `n`) remain in their original state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `arr[:n]` is in its original order, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n]` (or -1 if no such index existed previously).**
