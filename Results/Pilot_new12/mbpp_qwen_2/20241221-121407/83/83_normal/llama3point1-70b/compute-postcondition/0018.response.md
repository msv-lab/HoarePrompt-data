Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `arr[:n]` is in its original order, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n]` (or -1 if no such index existed previously). If `max_index` is not 0, then `arr[:max_index + 1]` is in reverse order, `n` remains greater than 0, `arr[max_index + 1:]` is in its original order, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n]` (or -1 if no such index existed previously). If `max_index` is 0, the list `arr` does not change.***
