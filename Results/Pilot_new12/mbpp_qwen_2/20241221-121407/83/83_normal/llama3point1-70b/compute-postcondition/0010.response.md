The code `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` finds the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:size]` and assigns it to `max_index`. Since the initial state specifies that `arr[:0]` is in its original order and `n` is greater than 0, `size` is implicitly `n`, meaning we are looking at the first `n` elements of `arr`.

Given this, the output state will reflect that `max_index` is now the index of the maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`, while the rest of the initial conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and the sublist `arr[:0]` is in its original order; if `max_index` is not equal to -1, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:n]`.**
