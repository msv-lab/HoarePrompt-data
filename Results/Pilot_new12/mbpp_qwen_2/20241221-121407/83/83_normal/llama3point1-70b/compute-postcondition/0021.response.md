Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is the length of `arr`, and the entire list `arr` is sorted in non-increasing order. If there was any reordering during the loop execution, the sublist `arr[:n]` is in its final ordered state.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the possible sizes of sublists in reverse order, starting from the full length of the array down to 1.
- For each size, it finds the maximum element in the current sublist and checks if it is at the end of the sublist.
- If the maximum element is not at the end, the algorithm reverses the elements up to the index of the maximum element and then reverses the entire sublist.
- This process ensures that the largest element is moved to the end of the current sublist in each iteration.
- By the time the loop completes, the entire list `arr` will be sorted in non-increasing order because the largest unsorted element will be moved to the end of the unsorted part of the list in each iteration.
- If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `n` is 0), `arr` remains an empty list, and `n` remains 0.
