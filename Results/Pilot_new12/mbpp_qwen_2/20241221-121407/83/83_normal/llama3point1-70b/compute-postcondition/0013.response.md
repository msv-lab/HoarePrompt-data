The code `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the sublist `arr[:size]`. Given the initial state where `arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and the sublist `arr[:n]` maintains its original order except for the elements from the start up to `max_index` inclusive, which are reversed if `max_index != 0`, the reversal operation affects only the first `size` elements of `arr`.

Since `size` is used in the code snippet, we assume `size` is either equal to or less than `n`. The first `size` elements of `arr` are reversed, and the rest of the list remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `arr` is a non-empty list.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The sublist `arr[:n]` now maintains its original order except for the elements from the start up to `max_index` inclusive, which are reversed if `max_index != 0`, but now the entire `arr[:size]` is reversed.
- The elements beyond `size` remain in their original positions.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, the sublist `arr[:n]` maintains its original order except for the elements from the start up to `max_index` inclusive, which are reversed if `max_index != 0`, but now the entire `arr[:size]` is reversed, and the elements beyond `size` remain in their original positions.**
