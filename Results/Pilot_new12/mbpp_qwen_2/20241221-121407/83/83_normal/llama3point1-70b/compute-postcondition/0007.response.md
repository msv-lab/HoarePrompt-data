The code `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the first `size` elements of the list `arr`. Given the initial conditions, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` was already reversed if `max_index` is not 0, and now this sublist is being reversed again. Since reversing a list twice results in the original list, the first `size` elements of `arr` will revert to their original order.

Given that `max_index` is not 0 or `size - 1`, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` was previously reversed, and now it is being reversed again, meaning it reverts back to its original order. Therefore, the value of `arr[:size]` returns to its original state.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and the sublist `arr[:size]` is in its original order, and `max_index` remains the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:size]`.**
