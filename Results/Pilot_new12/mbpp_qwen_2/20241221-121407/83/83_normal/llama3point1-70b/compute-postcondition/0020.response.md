Postcondition: ***`arr[:n]` is a non-empty list in its original order, `n` remains greater than 0, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n]` (or -1 if no such index existed previously). If `max_index` is not the last index, `arr[:n]` is reversed. Otherwise, the list remains unchanged.***
