The code `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]`. Given the initial state where `arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:size]`, and `max_index` is neither 0 nor `size - 1`, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` will be reversed.

Since `max_index` is neither 0 nor `size - 1`, the reversed sublist will affect the elements from the start of the list up to the element at `max_index`. The elements beyond `max_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:size]`, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed, and `max_index` is not equal to 0 or `size - 1`**
