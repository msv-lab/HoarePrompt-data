Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:size]`. If `max_index` is not 0, the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed. The value of `max_index` remains unchanged and is still not equal to 0 or `size - 1`.***
