The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of elements (which can be integers, floats, strings, etc.). After executing the function body, the function returns the list `arr` sorted in non-increasing order, with the first `n` elements in their final ordered state.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and return the list sorted in non-increasing order, with the first `n` elements in their final ordered state.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a non-empty list of elements. It returns the list arr sorted in non-increasing order, with the first n elements in their final ordered state.**
