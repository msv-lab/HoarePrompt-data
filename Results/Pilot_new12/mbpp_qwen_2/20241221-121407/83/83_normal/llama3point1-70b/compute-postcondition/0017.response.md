The code `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the subarray from the start of `arr` up to and including the element at `max_index`. This means the elements from the start of `arr` up to `max_index` will now be in reverse order.

Let's break this down:

1. The initial state of `arr` is a non-empty list.
2. `n` is greater than 0.
3. `arr[:n]` is in its original order.
4. `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n]` (or -1 if no such index existed previously).

After executing the code:

- The subarray `arr[:max_index + 1]` will be reversed. Since `arr[:n]` was in its original order and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n]`, the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` will now be in reverse order.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr[:max_index + 1]` is in reverse order, `n` is greater than 0, `arr[max_index + 1:]` is in its original order, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr[:n]` (or -1 if no such index existed previously)**.
