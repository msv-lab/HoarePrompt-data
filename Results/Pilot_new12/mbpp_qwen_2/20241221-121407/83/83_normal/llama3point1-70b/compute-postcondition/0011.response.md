The code `arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses the sublist from the start of the array up to and including the index `max_index`. Given that `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:n]`, the first part of the array up to and including this index will be reversed.

Since the initial state is that `arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and `arr[:0]` is in its original order, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:n]`, the reversed sublist will affect the elements from the beginning of the array up to and including the `max_index`.

Let's denote the maximum element's index as `max_index`. The elements from index `0` to `max_index` will be reversed, while the rest of the array remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list; `n` is greater than 0; `arr[:max_index + 1]` is the reverse of the original sublist from the start to the `max_index` inclusive; the rest of the array remains in its original order.**
