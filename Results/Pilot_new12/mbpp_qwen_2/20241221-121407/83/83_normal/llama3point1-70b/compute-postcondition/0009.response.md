According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from `n` to 1 (inclusive), decrementing `size` by 1 each time. The loop will continue to execute as long as `size` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `arr` is a non-empty list.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- The sublist `arr[:size]` is in its original order.
- If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, `max_index` remains the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:size]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `size` must be decremented by 1 and still be greater than 0.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. At the end of the previous iteration, `size` was some positive integer.
2. To execute the loop again, `size` must be decremented by 1, meaning `size` should now be `size - 1`.
3. Since the loop condition is `size > 0`, `size - 1` must still be greater than 0, implying that `size` must have been 1 at the end of the previous iteration. Therefore, `size` will now be 0.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `arr` remains a non-empty list.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- The sublist `arr[:size]` remains in its original order, but since `size` is now 0, this means the sublist is empty (`arr[:0]`).
- If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` (which is -1, but `max_index` is an index starting from 0), `max_index` remains the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:size]`. However, since `size` is 0, `max_index` does not affect the condition for the loop continuation.

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and the sublist `arr[:0]` is in its original order. If `max_index` is not equal to -1, `max_index` remains the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:0]`.**
