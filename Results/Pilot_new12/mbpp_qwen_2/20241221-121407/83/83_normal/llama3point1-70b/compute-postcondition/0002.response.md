`max_index` is assigned the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:size]`. The value of `size` is not explicitly defined, but it is assumed to be less than or equal to the length of `arr`. The state of `arr` and `n` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the sub-list `arr[:size]`.**
