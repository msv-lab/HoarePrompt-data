Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `arr` is a non-empty list.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - The sublist `arr[:n]` is in its original order.
   - If `max_index` is not equal to -1, the entire sub-list `arr[:size]` is reversed, and the elements beyond `size` remain in their original positions.
   - If `max_index` is equal to -1, the postcondition remains unchanged (i.e., the sublist `arr[:n]` is in its original order).

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for size in range(n, 0, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `size` in the range from `n` to `1` (inclusive) in reverse order.
   - At the end of each iteration, the value of `size` is decreased by 1.
   - The loop will continue until `size` reaches 0.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - Initially, `size` starts at `n`.
   - After the first iteration, `size` becomes `n-1`.
   - This process continues until `size` becomes 0.

5. **Final Iteration**:
   - For the final iteration, `size` will be 1.
   - The loop will stop when `size` becomes 0.

6. **Updated States**:
   - `arr` remains a non-empty list.
   - `n` remains greater than 0.
   - The sublist `arr[:n]` is still in its original order.
   - If `max_index` is not equal to -1, the entire sub-list `arr[:1]` (which is just the first element of `arr`) is reversed, but since it's only one element, it remains the same.
   - If `max_index` is equal to -1, the postcondition remains unchanged.

Given these considerations, the state at the start of the next iteration (the final iteration where `size` is 1) should be:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and the sublist `arr[:n]` is in its original order. If `max_index` is not equal to -1, the entire sub-list `arr[:1]` is reversed (which is the same as the original order), and the elements beyond 1 remain in their original positions. If `max_index` is equal to -1, the postcondition remains unchanged.**

However, since the loop is about to terminate, the final state can be simplified to:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and the sublist `arr[:n]` is in its original order. If `max_index` is not equal to -1, the entire sub-list `arr[:1]` is reversed (but remains the same), and the elements beyond 1 remain in their original positions. If `max_index` is equal to -1, the postcondition remains unchanged.**

In practical terms, the final state simplifies to:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and the sublist `arr[:n]` is in its original order. If `max_index` is not equal to -1, the first element of `arr` may have been reversed, but it remains the same, and the elements beyond `n` remain in their original positions. If `max_index` is equal to -1, the postcondition remains unchanged.**

Since the exact nature of the reversal is not specified and the final state is about to be determined by the loop termination, we can summarize it as:

State: **`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and the sublist `arr[:n]` is in its original order. If `max_index` is not equal to -1, the first element of `arr` may have been reversed, but it remains the same, and the elements beyond `n` remain in their original positions. If `max_index` is equal to -1, the postcondition remains unchanged.**
