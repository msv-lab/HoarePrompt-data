Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list `arr` of elements (which can be integers, floats, or strings). It iterates through the list from the largest possible size down to 1, finding the maximum element in each subarray and adjusting the list to ensure that the maximum element is moved to the front of the current subarray. This process continues until the entire list is sorted in non-increasing order. Specifically, the function ensures that the first `n` elements of the list (`n` being the length of the list) are in their final sorted order. The function does not modify the original list but returns a new list that meets these criteria. Potential edge cases include lists with duplicate maximum values, where the function will still sort the list correctly. The function does not handle empty lists; attempting to pass an empty list will result in an error since `len(arr)` would be 0, leading to an `IndexError`.**
