Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, and the sublist `arr[:n]` is in its original order. If `max_index` is not equal to `-1`, the entire sub-list `arr[:size]` is reversed, and the elements beyond `size` remain in their original positions. If `max_index` is equal to `-1`, the postcondition remains unchanged (i.e., the sublist `arr[:n]` is in its original order).***
