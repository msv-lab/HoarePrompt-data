The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums`. It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order. Then, it initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next. The function iterates through the list and updates the `dp` array based on the divisibility condition. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest sequence meeting the specified criteria.
