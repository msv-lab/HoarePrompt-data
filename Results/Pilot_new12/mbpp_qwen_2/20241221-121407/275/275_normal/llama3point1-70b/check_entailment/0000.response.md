Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program attempts to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. However, there is a logical error in the inner loop condition. Specifically, the line `for j in range(i):` should be `for j in range(i-1):` because we want to check if `nums[i]` is divisible by all previous elements except itself.

Consider the following test case:
- Input: `[2, 3, 6]`
- Expected output: `3` (since the entire list is a valid subset where each element divides the next)
- Actual output: `2` (the program only considers the subset `[2, 6]`)

This discrepancy indicates that the program does not handle the requirement correctly, hence the output is incorrect.
