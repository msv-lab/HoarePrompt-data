Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to be correct and follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of positive integers as input and returns the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible.
2. It first checks if the list is empty and returns 0 if true.
3. It sorts the list to facilitate the divisibility check.
4. It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subset ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the subset divides the next.
5. It iterates through the list and updates the `dp` array based on the divisibility condition.
6. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which is the length of the largest subset meeting the specified criteria.

Given the output hints and the provided code, the function correctly implements the required logic. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the hints that would make the function incorrect. Therefore, the code meets the problem description for every potential case.
