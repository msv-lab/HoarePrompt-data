Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program implements a dynamic programming solution to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The logic appears to be sound for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown:

- The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns 0, which is correct.
- It then sorts the list to facilitate the divisibility check.
- A `dp` array is initialized with 1s, representing the minimum size of the subset that ends at each index (initially just the element itself).
- For each element in the sorted list, it checks all previous elements to see if they divide the current element without a remainder. If they do, it updates the `dp` value for the current index.
- Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset.

Given this logic, the program correctly handles the requirement that every pair in the subset must be divisible. There doesn't seem to be any missing edge cases or logical errors that would cause the program to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
