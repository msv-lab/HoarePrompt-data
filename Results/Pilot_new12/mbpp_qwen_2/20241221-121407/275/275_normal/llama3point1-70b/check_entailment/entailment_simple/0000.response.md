Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic required to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible by one another. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The program first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns `0`. This handles the case where there are no elements to form a subset.

2. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. Sorting helps in ensuring that if a number `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` (where `j < i`), this relationship is checked efficiently.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program uses dynamic programming to find the largest subset where each pair is divisible. It initializes a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`.

4. **Filling the DP Table**: The nested loops iterate through the list to fill the `dp` table. For each pair `(i, j)` where `i > j`, it checks if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If true, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value or `dp[j] + 1`.

5. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the program returns the maximum value in the `dp` list, which corresponds to the size of the largest divisible subset.

The logic in the program ensures that it considers all possible subsets and keeps track of the largest subset where every element divides the next. Thus, the program correctly follows the problem description for any valid input list of positive integers.
