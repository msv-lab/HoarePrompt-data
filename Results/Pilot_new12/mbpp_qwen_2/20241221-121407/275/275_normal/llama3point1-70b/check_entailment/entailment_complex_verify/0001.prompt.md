You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program implements a dynamic programming solution to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The logic appears to be sound for the given problem description. Here's a breakdown:

- The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, it returns 0, which is correct.
- It then sorts the list to facilitate the divisibility check.
- A `dp` array is initialized with 1s, representing the minimum size of the subset that ends at each index (initially just the element itself).
- For each element in the sorted list, it checks all previous elements to see if they divide the current element without a remainder. If they do, it updates the `dp` value for the current index.
- Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset.

Given this logic, the program correctly handles the requirement that every pair in the subset must be divisible. There doesn't seem to be any missing edge cases or logical errors that would cause the program to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of positive integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of positive integers, and the list is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` is `len(nums)`, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`) represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums`. It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list in ascending order. Then, it initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where each element `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next. The function iterates through the list and updates the `dp` array based on the divisibility condition. Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest sequence meeting the specified criteria.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
