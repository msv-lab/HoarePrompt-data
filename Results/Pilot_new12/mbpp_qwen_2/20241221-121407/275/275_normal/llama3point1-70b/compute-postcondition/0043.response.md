The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of positive integers. The function has two return cases:
- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of positive integers `nums` and return either 0 or the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` where each element in the sequence divides the next.
