To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is equal to `len(nums)`.
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that it involves updating the `dp` list based on the divisibility condition.

Given these points, let's analyze the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time:

- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`. This means the loop has already processed all elements in `nums` up to the last element (`len(nums)-1`).
- Since `i` is now equal to `len(nums)`, the loop condition `j in range(i)` translates to `j in range(len(nums))`.

However, since `i` is already `len(nums)`, the loop cannot iterate further as `range(len(nums))` will stop at `len(nums)-1` and will not include `len(nums)` itself.

Therefore, the loop cannot execute another iteration because `i` is already at its maximum value.

**Conclusion**:
The state does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute another time because the loop has already completed its iterations.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`) represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next.**
