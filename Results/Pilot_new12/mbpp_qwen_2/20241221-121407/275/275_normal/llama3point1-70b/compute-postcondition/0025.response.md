Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `i` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `nums` is a list with at least one element.
   - `dp[i-1]` is updated to `max(dp[i-1], dp[j] + 1)` if `nums[i-1]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
   - `j` is irrelevant in the final state.

2. **Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `j = 0` to `j = i-1`.
   - In each iteration, it checks if `nums[i-1]` is divisible by `nums[j]` and updates `dp[i-1]` accordingly.

4. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is still an integer greater than 1.
   - `nums` is a list with at least one element.
   - `dp[i-1]` is updated based on the condition.
   - `j` is irrelevant in the final state.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 (since the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = i-1`, the next value of `i` would be `i+1`).
   - The state of `nums` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
   - `dp[i-1]` will be the updated value from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the new state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is an integer greater than 2 (since `i` is incremented by 1).
- `nums` is a list with at least one element.
- `dp[i-1]` is the updated value from the previous iteration.
- `j` is irrelevant in the final state.

State: **`i` is an integer greater than 2, `nums` is a list with at least one element, `dp[i-1]` is the updated value from the previous iteration, and `j` is irrelevant in the final state.**
