According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to `len(nums)`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`. This means that the loop has already completed all its iterations.

Since `i` is now equal to `len(nums)`, the condition `i in range(1, len(nums))` will no longer be true, and thus the loop will not execute again.

However, we need to adjust the state based on the information given:

- `i` is equal to `len(nums)`.
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`) represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next.
- `j` is irrelevant in the final state.

Since the loop has finished, there are no changes needed for `i`, `nums`, or `dp`. The value of `j` is irrelevant and does not affect the final state.

Therefore, the state remains unchanged.

State: **`i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`) represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next.**
