Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is `len(nums)`
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order
   - `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`) represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next
   - `j` is irrelevant in the final state

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(1, len(nums))`, meaning `i` starts from 1 up to but not including `len(nums)`.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `i` is currently `len(nums)`, it means that the loop has already executed for all values from 1 to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - Therefore, there are no more values for `i` to iterate over in the current loop condition.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop has completed its iterations, there are no changes needed to `i`, `nums`, or `dp` for the next iteration.
   - The variable `j` is irrelevant in the final state as per the given information.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that the loop has completed all its iterations, and there are no adjustments needed to the states for the loop to execute again because it won't execute again based on the given condition.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`i` is `len(nums)`, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`) represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next, and `j` is irrelevant in the final state.**
