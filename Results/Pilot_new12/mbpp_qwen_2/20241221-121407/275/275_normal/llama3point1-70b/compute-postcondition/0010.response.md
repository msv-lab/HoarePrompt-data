According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `i` is 1
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order
- `dp` is a list where the first element is 2 and the rest are 1
- `j` is 0
- If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is set to `dp[j] + 1`; otherwise, `dp[i]` remains 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what changes occur within the loop and how the loop condition affects the variables.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `i-1`.
   - Given `i` is currently 1, the loop will run for `j` from 0 to 0 (i.e., just once).

2. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is 1
   - `j` is 0

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - In the only iteration of the loop (`j = 0`), the condition checks if `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`.
     - If `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]`, then `dp[1]` will be set to `dp[0] + 1`.
     - Since `dp[0]` is 2, `dp[1]` will become 3.
     - Otherwise, `dp[1]` remains 1.

4. **After Loop Execution**:
   - `j` will increment to 1, but since the loop condition `j < i` (which is `j < 1`) is no longer satisfied, the loop will terminate.
   - `i` will remain 1 because it is not updated inside the loop.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration of the loop, `i` should be incremented to 2.
   - `j` will start from 0 again, and the loop will run for `j` from 0 to 1.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` will be 2.
- `j` will start from 0.
- The conditions and values of `nums`, `dp` remain unchanged from the previous state as they are not modified within the loop.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 0, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where the first element is 2 and the rest are 1.**
