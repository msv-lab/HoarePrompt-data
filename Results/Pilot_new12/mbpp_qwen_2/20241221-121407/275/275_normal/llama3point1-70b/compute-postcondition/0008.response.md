The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and considering the initial state:

- `i` is 1
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order
- `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with each element equal to 1
- `j` is 0
- `nums[i]` (which is `nums[1]`) is divisible by `nums[j]` (which is `nums[0]`)

Since `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[i]` will be updated to `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `dp[j]` is initially 1 (since `j` is 0), `dp[i]` will be updated to `1 + 1 = 2`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list where the first element is 2 and the rest are 1; `j` is 0; and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.**
