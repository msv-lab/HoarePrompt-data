Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `j` is 0, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp` is a list where the first element is 2 and the second element is 3, and the rest are 1. Since there is no else part, the value of `dp` remains unchanged if the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] != 0` is true.***
