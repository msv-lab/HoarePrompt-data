Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

**Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 0
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where the first element is 2 and the second element is 3, and the rest are 1 (if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`), otherwise `dp` remains unchanged.

**For Loop:**
```
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i = 2`
   - `j = 0`
   - `nums` is a sorted list of positive integers.
   - `dp = [2, 3, 1, 1, ...]` (assuming it has enough elements)

2. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1` (which is `1` in this case since `i = 2`).

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` was incremented from `0` to `1`.
   - The loop body was executed once, meaning the condition `nums[i] % nums[j]` was checked.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented to `2`.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `i` remains `2` because the value of `i` does not change within the loop.
   - `j` will be `2` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `nums` remains the same as it is not modified inside the loop.
   - `dp` remains unchanged unless the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` is met during the current or any future iterations.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 2
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list where the first element is 2 and the second element is 3, and the rest are 1 (unchanged from the previous state).

**State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where the first element is 2 and the second element is 3, and the rest are 1**.
