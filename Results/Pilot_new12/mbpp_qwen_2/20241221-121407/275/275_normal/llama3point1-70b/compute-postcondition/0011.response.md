`dp[i]` is assigned the value of the maximum between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, and `dp` is a list where the first element is 2 and the rest are 1. 

- Initially, `dp[2]` is 1.
- `dp[0]` is 2.

So, `dp[i]` (which is `dp[2]`) is compared with `dp[j] + 1` (which is `dp[0] + 1` or `2 + 1`).

Therefore, `dp[2]` is updated to `max(1, 3)`, which is 3.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 0, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where the first element is 2 and the second element is 3, and the rest are 1.**
