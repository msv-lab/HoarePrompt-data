State: **`i` is 1, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with each element equal to 1, `j` is now 0**

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for j in range(i):` will execute as long as `j < i`.
2. Given that `i` is initially 1, the loop condition `j < i` will only be true if `j` is less than 1.
3. Since `j` is being iterated over using `range(i)`, the loop will start with `j` being 0 and increment by 1 until `j` reaches 1.
4. Therefore, before the loop starts, `j` must be 0 to satisfy the loop condition `j < i`.

Hence, the state needs to be adjusted to include `j` being 0, while keeping the other given states unchanged.
