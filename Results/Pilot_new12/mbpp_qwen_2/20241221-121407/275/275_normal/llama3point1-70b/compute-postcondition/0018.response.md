Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is `len(nums)`
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order
   - `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next
   - `j` is irrelevant in the final state

2. **For Loop:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0 because the range function `range(i)` will generate values from `0` to `i-1` only if `i > 0`.

4. **Required Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` is initially `len(nums)`, for the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0. This implies that `nums` must have at least one element.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` must be greater than 0 (which means `len(nums)` must be at least 1)
   - `nums` must have at least one element
   - `dp` remains as is because the loop body is omitted and does not modify `dp`
   - `j` is irrelevant in the final state as mentioned.

Therefore, the state after adjustment for the loop to execute is:

State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `nums` must have at least one element, `dp` remains as is, `j` is irrelevant in the final state**
