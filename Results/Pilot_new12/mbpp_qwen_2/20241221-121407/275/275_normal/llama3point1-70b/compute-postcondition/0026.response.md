The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. Since the initial value of `dp[i]` is `dp[i-1]` from the previous iteration, and `j` is irrelevant in the final state, the only relevant information is the update of `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than 2, `nums` is a list with at least one element, `dp[i]` is max(`dp[i-1]`, `dp[j] + 1`), and `j` is irrelevant in the final state.**
