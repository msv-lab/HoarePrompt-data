Let's analyze the given code snippet step by step:

- Initial State:
  - `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, which means `i` starts at the index one past the last element in the list `nums`.
  - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
  - `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`) represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next.

- Code Snippet:
  ```python
  dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
  ```

This line of code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Here, `j` is a variable that is not defined in this context, so it seems there might be a misunderstanding or missing context about `j`.

Assuming `j` is intended to represent an index before `i` (i.e., `j < i`), let's consider the typical usage of dynamic programming where `j` would be a previous index that is checked to see if the condition of divisibility holds.

Since `i` is set to `len(nums)` initially, the line `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` will not execute because `i` is out of bounds of the `dp` list (which goes from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`). Therefore, no changes will be made to the `dp` list in this iteration.

Given this, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`) represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next.**
