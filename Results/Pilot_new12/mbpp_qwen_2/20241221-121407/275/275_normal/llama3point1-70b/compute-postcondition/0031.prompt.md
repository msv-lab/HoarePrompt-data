You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`,  if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m. a is a list of integers. the current value of  n is lower than 0***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Conditions**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(i):`. This means the loop will iterate over the range from `0` to `i-1`.

2. **Understand the Initial State**: 
   - `i` is equal to `len(nums)`.
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`) represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next.

3. **Determine the Loop Execution Condition**:
   - For the loop `for j in range(i)` to execute, `i` must be a valid starting point for the loop.
   - Since `i` is set to `len(nums)`, the loop `for j in range(i)` would evaluate `range(len(nums))`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `i` is `len(nums)`, the loop will start with `j` ranging from `0` to `len(nums)-1`. Therefore, the loop will indeed execute.
   - No changes are needed to the initial state of `i` because `i` being `len(nums)` ensures the loop will run correctly.

5. **Final State Adjustment**:
   - The initial value of `i` is `len(nums)`, which means the loop will iterate over the indices from `0` to `len(nums)-1`.
   - There are no other variables or conditions that need to be adjusted based on the given information.

**State**: **`i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`) represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next.**

Since `i` is set to `len(nums)`, the loop will execute as expected without needing any adjustments.
if condition:
```
if (nums[i] % nums[j] == 0):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the if condition must also be included. If the variables have values related to previous conditions try to put that early in the postcondition and say the current value of the variable from then on. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition.
