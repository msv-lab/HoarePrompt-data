The code updates `dp[i]` to the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i-1]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. Since `i` is an integer greater than 1 and `j` is irrelevant in the final state, the only variable that gets updated is `dp[i-1]` based on the condition provided.

Given the precondition, `dp[i-1]` is updated to `max(dp[i-1], dp[j] + 1)` if `nums[i-1]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. The values of `i`, `nums`, and `dp` (except for the possible update to `dp[i-1]`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list with at least one element, `dp[i-1]` is updated to `max(dp[i-1], dp[j] + 1)` if `nums[i-1]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and `j` is irrelevant in the final state.**
