The code snippet `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` iterates over the indices `i` and `j` in the list `nums`. For each `i`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` where `j < i` and `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. This means that `dp[i]` is updated to reflect the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` where each element divides the next.

Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

- `i` remains unchanged because the code does not reassign its value.
- `nums` remains unchanged because the code does not modify its contents.
- `dp` is updated according to the condition `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` for all `j` where `j < i` and `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

Given that `nums` is sorted in ascending order, for each `i`, `dp[i]` will be updated to include the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` where each element divides the next.

Since the exact values of `nums` and `dp` are not provided, we can only express the updated `dp` in terms of the original `dp` and the conditions given.

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` where `j < i` and `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`**
