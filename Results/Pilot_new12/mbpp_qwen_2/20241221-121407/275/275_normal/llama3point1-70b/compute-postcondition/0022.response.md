Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `nums` is a list with at least one element.
   - `dp` remains unchanged except for possible updates to `dp[i]` where `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
   - `j` is irrelevant in the final state.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.
   - For each value of `j`, the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

4. **State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since the loop is about to start a new iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` becomes `i+1`).
   - The list `nums` and the list `dp` remain unchanged in this context (other than potential updates inside the loop).
   - The variable `j` is irrelevant in the final state as per the given information.

5. **Final State:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will now be `i+1`.
   - `nums` remains unchanged.
   - `dp` may have been updated during the previous iterations, but it does not change for the next iteration's starting state.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`i` is an integer greater than 1, `nums` is a list with at least one element, `dp` remains unchanged except for possible updates to `dp[i-1]` where `dp[i-1]` is updated to `max(dp[i-1], dp[j] + 1)` if `nums[i-1]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and `j` is irrelevant in the final state.**
