The code initializes a list `dp` with a length equal to the length of `nums`, where each element is set to 1. This means that `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`, with every element being 1. The initial state of `nums` is unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`, with each element equal to 1.**
