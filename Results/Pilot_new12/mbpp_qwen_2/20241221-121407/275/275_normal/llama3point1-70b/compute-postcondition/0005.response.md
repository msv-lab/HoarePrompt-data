Let's break down the given task step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop:**
   - The loop variable is `i`.
   - The list being iterated over is `nums`.

2. **Determine the Range of the Loop:**
   - The loop starts from `1` and goes up to but does not include `len(nums)`.
   - This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`.

3. **Initial State of Variables:**
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`, with each element equal to 1.

4. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be in the range from `1` to `len(nums) - 1` (inclusive).

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop starts from `i = 1`, we need to ensure that `i` is set to `1` at the start of the loop.
   - We also need to ensure that the condition `i < len(nums)` holds true for the first iteration, which it will since `i` starts at `1` and `len(nums)` is always greater than or equal to `1`.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` should be set to `1` at the start of the loop.
- `nums` must be a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` must be a list of the same length as `nums`, with each element equal to `1`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`i` is 1, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with each element equal to 1**.
