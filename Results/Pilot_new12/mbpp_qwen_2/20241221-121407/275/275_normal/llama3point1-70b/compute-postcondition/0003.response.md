`nums.sort()` sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. Since `nums` is a list of positive integers and is not empty, after sorting, the elements in `nums` will be arranged in ascending order. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order**
