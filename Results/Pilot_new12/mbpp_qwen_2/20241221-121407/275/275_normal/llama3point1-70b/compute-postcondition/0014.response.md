The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given the initial state:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 2
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order (its value is not needed for this specific calculation)
- `dp` is a list where the first element is 2 and the second element is 3, and the rest are 1, so `dp` is `[2, 3, 1, 1, ...]`

The specific values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` are:
- `dp[i]` is `dp[2]`, which is 1
- `dp[j]` is `dp[2]`, which is also 1

Therefore, `dp[i] = max(1, 1 + 1) = max(1, 2) = 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `dp` is [2, 3, 2, 1, ...]**
