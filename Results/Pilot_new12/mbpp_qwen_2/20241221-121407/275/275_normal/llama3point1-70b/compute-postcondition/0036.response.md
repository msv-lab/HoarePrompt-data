Postcondition: ***`i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` (for `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`) represents the length of the longest sequence ending at `nums[i]` such that each element in the sequence divides the next. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for any `j` where `j < i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. No updates occur if there is no such `j`.***
