The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `j` is irrelevant in the final state, we only focus on `i`, `dp`, and `nums`. Given that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, this condition will be checked during the execution.

The updated value of `dp[i]` will be `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than 0, `nums` is a list with at least one element, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, `dp` remains unchanged except for `dp[i]`, `j` is irrelevant in the final state, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`**
