The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums`. It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list and then constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element. After populating the `dp` array, the function returns the maximum value found in `dp`.

Potential edge cases include:
- An empty list, which results in a return value of 0.
- A non-empty list of positive integers, where the function computes the length of the longest subsequence under the specified divisibility condition and returns the maximum value in the `dp` array.

Missing functionality (if any) is not present in the provided code, and the annotations accurately reflect the code's behavior.
