Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. The approach uses dynamic programming (`dp`) to keep track of the size of the largest subset ending at each index. 

Given the provided test cases:
1. For `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]`, the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`, which has a size of 4.
2. For `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]`, the largest subset is `[5, 10, 20]`, which has a size of 3.
3. For `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]`, the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`, which has a size of 4.

The function sorts the list first, ensuring that the divisibility check works correctly, and then iterates through the list to fill the `dp` array. This approach correctly handles the divisibility condition and finds the largest subset size. There doesn't seem to be any missing edge cases or logical flaws that would cause the function to fail under other conditions either.
