Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles edge cases like an empty list and non-empty lists of positive integers. The dynamic programming approach used in the function ensures that the divisibility condition is met for the elements in the largest subset. The provided test cases and the output hints support the correctness of the function. Therefore, there is no evidence to change the original assessment.
