You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The approach sorts the array and uses a DP array to keep track of the maximum size of such subsets ending at each index. 

The assertions provided cover different scenarios:
1. `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]` - Here, the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]` which has 4 elements.
2. `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]` - Here, the largest subset is `[5, 10, 20]` which has 3 elements.
3. `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]` - Here, the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]` which has 4 elements.

Given the logic and the provided test cases, the program seems to handle the problem correctly for these examples. Since the problem does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases beyond the examples provided, and the code appears to follow the correct algorithmic approach, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums`. It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list and then constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element. After populating the `dp` array, the function returns the maximum value found in `dp`.

Potential edge cases include:
- An empty list, which results in a return value of 0.
- A non-empty list of positive integers, where the function computes the length of the longest subsequence under the specified divisibility condition and returns the maximum value in the `dp` array.

Missing functionality (if any) is not present in the provided code, and the annotations accurately reflect the code's behavior.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
