Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair is divisible. The function first checks if the list is empty and returns 0 if it is. Otherwise, it sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to determine the length of the longest subsequence under the specified divisibility condition. The `dp` array keeps track of the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index. The function returns the maximum value found in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset.

The code handles all the given assertions correctly and the provided output hints confirm that the code behaves as expected. There are no edge cases or examples mentioned that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case.
