Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The provided assertions cover different scenarios and validate the functionality of the program. The output hints accurately describe the behavior of the function, including handling an empty list and a list of positive integers. There is no evidence from the provided information that suggests the program is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
