Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The approach sorts the array and uses a DP array to keep track of the maximum size of such subsets ending at each index. 

The assertions provided cover different scenarios:
1. `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]` - Here, the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]` which has 4 elements.
2. `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]` - Here, the largest subset is `[5, 10, 20]` which has 3 elements.
3. `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]` - Here, the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]` which has 4 elements.

Given the logic and the provided test cases, the program seems to handle the problem correctly for these examples. Since the problem does not specify any additional constraints or edge cases beyond the examples provided, and the code appears to follow the correct algorithmic approach, we can conclude that the program is correct.
