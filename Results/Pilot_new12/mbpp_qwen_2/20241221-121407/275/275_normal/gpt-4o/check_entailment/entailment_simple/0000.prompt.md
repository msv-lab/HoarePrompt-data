You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of positive integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of positive integers, and the list is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, and for each index `i` from 0 to `len(nums)-1`, `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element. The loop will have executed for all valid `i` values from 0 to `len(nums)-1`, and `i` is `len(nums)`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `i` starts at `len(nums)`), the state remains as the initial state.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value found in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
