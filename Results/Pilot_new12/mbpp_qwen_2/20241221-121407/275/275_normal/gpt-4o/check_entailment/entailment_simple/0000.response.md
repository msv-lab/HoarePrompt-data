Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of elements in the subset is divisible.

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list of positive integers as input.
   - It first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns 0.
   - It sorts the list, which helps in ensuring that any potential divisibility relationship can be checked in a sequential manner.
   - It initializes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element.
   - It iterates through the list using two nested loops. For each element at index `i`, it checks all previous elements at index `j` (where `j < i`). If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset meeting the divisibility condition.

3. **Validation with Examples**:
   - The provided test cases assert that:
     - For `nums = [1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]`, the largest subset where every pair is divisible is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`, which has a size of 4.
     - For `nums = [10, 5, 3, 15, 20]`, the largest subset is `[5, 10, 20]`, which has a size of 3.
     - For `nums = [18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]`, the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`, which has a size of 4.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset with the required property and the provided examples validate this behavior, the program is correct according to the problem description.
