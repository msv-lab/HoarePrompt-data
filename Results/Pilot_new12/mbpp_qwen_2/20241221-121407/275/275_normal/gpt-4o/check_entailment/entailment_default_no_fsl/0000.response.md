Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair is divisible. The code handles the edge case of an empty list by returning 0. It also sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to build the `dp` array, ensuring that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous one. The examples provided in the problem description and the output hints match the behavior of the code, and no missing functionality was identified. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
