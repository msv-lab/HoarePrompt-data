Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair is divisible. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description Compliance**: 
   - The problem requires finding the largest subset where every pair is divisible. The program uses a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem.
   - It first checks if the list is empty, returning 0 if it is.
   - Then, it sorts the list and initializes a `dp` array where `dp[i]` stores the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` with the divisibility condition satisfied.
   - It iterates through the list, checking divisibility conditions and updating the `dp` array accordingly.
   - Finally, it returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the length of the largest subset meeting the criteria.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - The program handles the case of an empty list by returning 0.
   - For non-empty lists, it correctly sorts the list and processes it using dynamic programming to ensure the divisibility condition is met.

3. **Correctness Explanation**:
   - Sorting the list ensures that for each element `nums[i]`, all elements `nums[j]` where `j < i` are smaller and can be checked for divisibility.
   - The `dp` array is updated to store the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index that satisfies the divisibility condition.
   - The final result is the maximum value in the `dp` array, ensuring the largest subset size is returned.

Since the program accurately implements the described logic and correctly handles all specified edge cases, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
