#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of positive integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of positive integers, and the list is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, and for each index `i` from 0 to `len(nums)-1`, `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element. The loop will have executed for all valid `i` values from 0 to `len(nums)-1`, and `i` is `len(nums)`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `i` starts at `len(nums)`), the state remains as the initial state.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value found in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums`. It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list and then constructs a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element. After populating the `dp` array, the function returns the maximum value found in `dp`.

Potential edge cases include:
- An empty list, which results in a return value of 0.
- A non-empty list of positive integers, where the function computes the length of the longest subsequence under the specified divisibility condition and returns the maximum value in the `dp` array.

Missing functionality (if any) is not present in the provided code, and the annotations accurately reflect the code's behavior.
