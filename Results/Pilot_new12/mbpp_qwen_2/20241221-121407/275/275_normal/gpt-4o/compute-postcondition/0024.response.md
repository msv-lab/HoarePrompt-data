Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, and for each index `i`, `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.***
