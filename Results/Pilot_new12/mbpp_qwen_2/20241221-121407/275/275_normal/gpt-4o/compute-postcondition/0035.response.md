The code snippet updates `dp[i]` to the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. This means that `dp[i]` is updated if and only if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

In the initial state, `i` is a positive integer + 1, and `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. Since there is no else part, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`.

After executing the code, the value of `i` remains unchanged because the code does not modify it. The value of `dp[i]` may change if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, but without specific values for `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `dp[i]`. However, we know that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
