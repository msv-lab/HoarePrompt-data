`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. This means that `dp[i]` will now be updated to the larger value between its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. The values of `i`, `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `dp[j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` must be greater than 0, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, `dp[i]` is updated to max(`dp[i]`, `dp[j] + 1`)**
