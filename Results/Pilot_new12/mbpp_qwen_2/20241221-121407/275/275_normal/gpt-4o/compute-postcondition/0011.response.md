The code snippet updates the `dp` list at index `i`. Specifically, `dp[i]` is set to the maximum value between its current value (`dp[i]`) and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is presumably some index less than `i`. Given the initial state, `dp[i]` is initially 2 (since it's the only element not equal to 1), and `dp[j]` is 1 for all `j < i`.

Since the exact value of `j` is not specified, let's consider the general case where `dp[j]` is 1 for all `j < i`. In this case, `dp[j] + 1` would be 2.

Therefore, `dp[i]` will be updated to `max(2, 2)`, which remains 2.

The states of the other variables and lists are not affected. Thus, the Output State is:

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is 1 except `dp[i]` which is now 2, `i` is greater than 1**
