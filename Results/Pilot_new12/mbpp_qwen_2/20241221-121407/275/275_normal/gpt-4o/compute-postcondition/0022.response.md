To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the for loop, we need to consider how the loop variable `j` is modified and what conditions must be satisfied for the loop to continue.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element.
   - `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element.
   - `i` is greater than 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`.

3. **Loop Body:**
   - For each `j` in the range, the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

4. **State Adjustment for Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute again if `i` is incremented.
   - Since `i` was greater than 0, let's assume it was `i = k` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` must still be within the bounds of the list, i.e., `i < len(nums)`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `nums` remains unchanged.
   - `dp` remains unchanged.
   - `i` is now `k + 1`, which is greater than 0.

### Conclusion:

At the start of the next iteration of the loop, the state should be:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element.
- `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element.
- `i` is now `k + 1`, which is greater than 0.

Thus, the final state is:
**`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element, and `i` is greater than 0.**

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element, and `i` is greater than 1**
