The `sort()` method sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. After sorting, the list `nums` will contain its elements in sorted order, but the individual values of the elements themselves are not specified. The initial state only tells us that `nums` is a list of positive integers and is not empty. After sorting, the list remains the same list object, just with its elements rearranged.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order**
