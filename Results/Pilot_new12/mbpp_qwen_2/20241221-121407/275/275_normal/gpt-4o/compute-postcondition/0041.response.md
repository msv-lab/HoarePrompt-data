Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, and for each index `i` from 0 to `len(nums)-1`, `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element. The loop will have executed for all valid `i` values from 0 to `len(nums)-1`, and `i` is `len(nums)`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `i` starts at `len(nums)`), the state remains as the initial state.**
