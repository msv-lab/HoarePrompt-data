The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of positive integers. 

- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns the maximum value found in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at each index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of positive integers `nums` and either return 0 or return the maximum value in the list `dp` representing the length of the longest subsequence under specified conditions.
