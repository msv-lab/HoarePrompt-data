Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order and must have at least one element.
   - `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is 1.
   - `i` is 0.

2. **For Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range from 0 to `i` (exclusive).
   - Since `i` is 0 initially, the range `range(i)` translates to `range(0)`, which means the loop body will not be executed because there are no values of `j` in this range.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0 because `range(i)` would then include at least one value of `j`.
   - Therefore, we need to adjust `i` to be greater than 0.

4. **Final State**:
   - `nums` remains a list of positive integers in sorted order and must have at least one element.
   - `dp` remains a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is 1.
   - `i` must be greater than 0 to allow the loop to execute.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
**State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order that must have at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is 1, `i` must be greater than 0**
