Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element.
   - `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, where each element is 1 except `dp[i+1]` which is now 2.

2. **Code Snippet**: 
   ```python
   dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
   ```
   This line of code updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - The code assumes that `i` and `j` are indices within the bounds of `dp`.
   - `dp[i]` is updated based on the value of `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp[j]` was initially set to 1 for all elements except `dp[i+1]` (which is 2), the expression `dp[j] + 1` can be 2 (for `j` such that `dp[j]` is 1) or 3 (for `j` such that `dp[j]` is 2).
   - This means `dp[i]` can increase based on the previous values in the `dp` array.

4. **Specific Example Calculation**:
   - Let's assume `nums = [1, 3, 5, 7]` (a simple example to illustrate). Then `dp = [1, 1, 1, 2]` because `dp[3]` was set to 2.
   - For `i = 0`, `dp[0]` can only be updated by checking `dp[j]` for `j < 0`, which is not possible since there are no elements before the first one. So, `dp[0]` remains 1.
   - For `i = 1`, `dp[1]` can be updated by checking `dp[0] + 1`, which is `1 + 1 = 2`. So, `dp[1]` becomes 2.
   - For `i = 2`, `dp[2]` can be updated by checking `dp[1] + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`. So, `dp[2]` becomes 3.
   - For `i = 3`, `dp[3]` can be updated by checking `dp[2] + 1`, which is `3 + 1 = 4`. So, `dp[3]` becomes 4.

Given this analysis, the updated state of the variables after executing the code is:

- `nums` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the code.
- `dp` is updated according to the logic of the code, specifically the maximum value of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element; `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, where each element is 1 except `dp[i+1]` which is now 2, and for each `i` from 0 to `len(nums)-1`, `dp[i]` is the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < i`.**
