According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `i`. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, the condition `j < i` will never be true because `i` is 0, meaning `j` cannot take any value that would satisfy this condition.

Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to adjust the initial state such that `i` is greater than 0, allowing `j` to take values from 0 up to but not including `i`.

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element, `i` is greater than 0**
