Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element, `i` is greater than 0, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.**
