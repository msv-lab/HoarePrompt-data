According to the given code, the loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = i-1`. The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` remains 2. The state at the end of the previous iteration is provided as follows:

- `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element.
- `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is 1 except `dp[i]` which is now 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:

1. `i` will be `i + 1`.
2. `dp[i]` will still be 2 because it was set to 2 in the previous iteration based on the condition `nums[i]` being divisible by `nums[j]`.

The key point here is that the loop continues to check for divisibility conditions, but since the condition did not change the value of `dp[i]` in the previous iteration, it will remain 2 for the new `i`.

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is 1 except `dp[i+1]` which is now 2.**
