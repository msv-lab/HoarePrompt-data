Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Given Information:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order.
- `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`.
- For each index `i`, `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element.
- `i` is the length of `nums`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `i`:**
   - The loop variable `j` ranges from `0` to `i-1`.
   - Since `i` is the length of `nums`, we need `i` to be a valid integer greater than 0 for the loop to start executing.
   
2. **List `nums`:**
   - `nums` is given to be a list of positive integers in sorted order. This property doesn't directly affect the loop but ensures that the elements are in ascending order, which could be useful for the loop logic.

3. **List `dp`:**
   - `dp` is a list of length `len(nums)`, and each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` with the specified condition.
   - Initially, `dp` might not have values set, but the loop will use its values to update them.

4. **Loop Variable `j`:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range `0` to `i-1`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1 (since `range(0)` would not produce any iterations).

### Conclusion:
The key state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are ensuring that `i` is greater than 0. The other states (`nums` and `dp`) are already correctly initialized or don't impact the loop's execution based on the given information.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` must be greater than 0**
