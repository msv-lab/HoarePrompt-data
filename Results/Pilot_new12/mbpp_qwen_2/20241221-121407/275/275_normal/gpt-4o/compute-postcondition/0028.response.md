Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, and for each index `i`, `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element. After the loop finishes executing, `i` is `len(nums)`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. No additional changes occur in `dp` if this condition is not met.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all indices `j` from 0 to `i-1`. For each pair `(i, j)`, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
- This means that after all iterations of the loop, the `dp` list will contain the lengths of the longest subsequences ending at each index `i` such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element.
- The loop runs until `i` reaches `len(nums)`, meaning that every index in `nums` has been processed.
- Therefore, after the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `len(nums)`, and `dp` will be updated according to the rule described above.
