Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element, and `i` is greater than 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for some valid `j`. No other changes occur in the lists if the condition is not met.***
