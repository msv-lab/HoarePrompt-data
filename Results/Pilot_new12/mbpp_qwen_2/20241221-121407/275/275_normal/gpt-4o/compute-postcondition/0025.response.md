To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and the logic of the loop.

### Given Information:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element.
- `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`.
- For each index `i`, `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element.
- The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element.
- `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`.
- `i` is the current index being processed in the outer loop (which was not specified in the example but we need to consider the general case).

### Loop Analysis:
The inner loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = i - 1`. For each `j` in this range, the loop body updates `dp[i]` based on the divisibility condition between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.

### Adjustments Needed:
- For the loop to execute one more time, the outer loop must proceed to the next index (`i+1`).
- The `j` loop will then run from `0` to `i` (new `i`).

### Updated States:
- The list `nums` remains unchanged as it is not modified inside the loop.
- The `dp` list needs to be updated for the new `i` value, but since we are only asked about the state before the next iteration starts, we don't need to specify the exact values in `dp` yet.
- The variable `i` will be incremented to `i + 1`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, and `i` is `i + 1`**. 

This means that the loop can now proceed to the next iteration where `i` is incremented by 1.
