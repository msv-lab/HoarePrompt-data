Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, and `i` is `i + 1`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in `dp` if this condition is not met.**
