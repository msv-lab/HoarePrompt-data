Postcondition: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element; `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, where each element is 1 except `dp[i+1]` which is now 2, and for each `i` from 0 to `len(nums)-1`, `dp[i]` is the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < i` where `nums[j]` divides `nums[i]`.**
