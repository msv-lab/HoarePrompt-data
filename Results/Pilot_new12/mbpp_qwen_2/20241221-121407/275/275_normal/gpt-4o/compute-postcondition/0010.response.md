According to the code, the loop is iterating over the range from `0` to `i`. The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `j` must be less than `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element.
- `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, where each element is 1 except `dp[i]` which is now 2.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- This state is achieved if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for some index `j`. If no such `j` exists, the state remains unchanged.

To determine the state for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:
1. For the loop to continue, `j` must be less than `i`.
2. The value of `i` does not change within the loop itself, but it could change outside the loop.
3. The only way the state would remain unchanged is if there is no `j` such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` (which is already considered in the current state).

Since the loop is iterating from `0` to `i-1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased to `i+1` because `j` will then range from `0` to `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `nums` is still a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element.
- `dp` is still a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, where each element is 1 except `dp[i]` which is now 2.
- `i` is now `i + 1`, which is greater than 1 (since `i` was greater than 0 and is incremented by 1).

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is 1 except `dp[i]` which is now 2, `i` is greater than 1**
