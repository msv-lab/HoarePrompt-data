Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is a positive integer.
   - `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
   - `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The for loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each `j` in the range `[0, i-1]`, the loop body updates `dp[i]` based on the condition that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
   - The loop body updates `dp[i]` to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - To determine the state at the start of the next iteration (where `i` is incremented to `i+1`), we need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1.
   - The value of `dp[i]` will be updated based on the values of `dp[j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, i-1]`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become `i+1`.
   - The value of `dp[i]` will depend on the values of `dp[j]` for all `j` in the range `[0, i-1]`. However, since we are starting the next iteration, the specific value of `dp[i]` is not yet determined.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is a positive integer + 1, and `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. Since there is no else part, `dp[i]` remains unchanged if `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`.**
