Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is 1 except `dp[i]` which is now 2, `i` is greater than 0, and this state is achieved if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` for some index `j`. If no such `j` exists, the state remains unchanged.***
