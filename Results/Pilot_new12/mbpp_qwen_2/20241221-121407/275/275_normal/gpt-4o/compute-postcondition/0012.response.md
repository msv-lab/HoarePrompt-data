Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is 1 except `dp[i]` which is now 2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` remains 2. Since there is no else part, the postcondition does not change under any other circumstance.***
