The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. However, the values of `i` and `j` are not explicitly defined in the given code snippet. We know that `i` is updated to `i + 1`, but the initial value of `i` is not specified, and `j` is also not defined in the snippet.

Given the initial state, let's assume `i` starts from 0 (since `i` is not specified otherwise) and `j` is a valid index for the `dp` list. The `dp` list is initialized to a length equal to `len(nums)` and contains some initial values (though those values are not specified).

Let's denote the initial value of `i` as `i_0` and the initial value of `dp[j]` as `dp_j`.

The code snippet modifies `dp[i]` as follows:

```python
dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` is `i_0 + 1`.

The value of `dp[i_0 + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `dp[i_0 + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
- `i` is now `i_0 + 1`.

Output State: **`dp[i + 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`; `i` is `i + 1`**
