Let's analyze the given information step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State
- `nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element.
- `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element.
- `i` is `len(nums)`, indicating that the loop has not yet started.

### For Loop Analysis
The for loop iterates over the indices of `nums`:

```python
for i in range(len(nums)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

This means that the loop will start iterating from `i = 0` up to `i = len(nums) - 1`.

### Current State at the End of Previous Iteration
- `i` is `len(nums)`, meaning the loop has not yet started.

### Adjustments Needed for Next Iteration
Since `i` is `len(nums)`, the first iteration of the loop will start with `i` set to `0`.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `i` needs to be set to `0`.
- Since the loop has just started, `dp` should retain its current values because no changes have been made yet.

### Updated State
- `i` should be adjusted to `0`.
- `dp` should remain unchanged as no modifications have occurred yet.

### Final Answer
State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element, `i` is 0**.
