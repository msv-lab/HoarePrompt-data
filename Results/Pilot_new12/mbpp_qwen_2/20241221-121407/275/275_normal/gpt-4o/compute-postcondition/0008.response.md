The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `dp[j]` is initially 1 (since it's initialized to 1 for each element in `nums`), the value of `dp[i]` will be updated to `max(1, dp[j] + 1)`, which simplifies to `max(1, 1 + 1) = 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element is 1 except `dp[i]` which is now 2, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is an index such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`**
