According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, meaning the loop has completed all iterations.

Since the loop has finished executing, there are no updates needed for `dp` or `nums`. However, we need to reflect the final state where `i` is `len(nums)`.

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)`, and for each index `i`, `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element, `i` is `len(nums)`**
