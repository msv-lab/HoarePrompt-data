The code snippet updates the value of `dp[i]` to the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. This means that `dp[i]` is only updated if there exists some `j` such that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged. 

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `nums` and `dp`, and the code snippet does not give specific values for `i` and `j`, the output state will reflect the updated value of `dp[i]` based on the condition given.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
