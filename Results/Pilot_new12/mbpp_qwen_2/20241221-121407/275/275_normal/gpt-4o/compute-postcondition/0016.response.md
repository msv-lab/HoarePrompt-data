Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order with at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` where each element represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at that index such that each element in the subsequence is divisible by the previous element, `i` is `len(nums)`, and this state is achieved if for each index `i` from 0 to `len(nums)-1`, `dp[i]` is the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j < i` where `nums[j]` divides `nums[i]`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., when `i` starts at `len(nums)`), the state remains as the initial state.**
