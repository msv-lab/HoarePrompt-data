Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `i` is a positive integer + 1.
- `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `j < i`.
2. **Effect of the Loop**: For each `j` in the range `0` to `i-1`, the value of `dp[i]` is updated based on whether `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning
1. **Initial Values**:
   - `i` is a positive integer + 1.
   - `dp[i]` is updated or remains unchanged based on the divisibility condition.

2. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the start of the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 (since `i` is a positive integer + 1).
   - The loop will now iterate over `j` from `0` to `i-1`.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `i` will be incremented by 1, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - The state of `dp[i]` will depend on the values of `dp[j]` for all `j` in the previous range.

### Final State
At the start of the next iteration, the state will be:
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `dp[i]` is still the value it was at the end of the previous iteration (which could have been updated or remained unchanged).

### Adjusted State
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, and `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**

So, the final answer is:
State: **`i` is `i + 1`, and `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.**
