The code initializes a list `dp` with the length equal to the length of the list `nums`, where each element in `dp` is set to 1. This means that `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`, with each element being 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers in sorted order, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums` where each element is 1**
