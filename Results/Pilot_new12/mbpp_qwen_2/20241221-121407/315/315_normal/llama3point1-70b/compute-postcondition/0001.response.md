The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `input_list`, which is a list, and `input_tuple`, which is a tuple. After executing the function body, it returns a new list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and the list converted from `input_tuple`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list and a tuple, convert the tuple to a list, and then concatenate it with the original list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, converts `input_tuple` to a list, and returns the concatenation of `input_list` and the converted list.**
