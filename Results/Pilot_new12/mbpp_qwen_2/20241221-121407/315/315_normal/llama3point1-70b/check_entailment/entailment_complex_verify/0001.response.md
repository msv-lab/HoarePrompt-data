Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` is designed to take a list and a tuple as inputs and return a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the converted tuple to a list. The annotated version confirms that the function correctly performs this operation. It handles the case where the tuple might be empty (returning the original list) and where the list might be empty (returning the list representation of the tuple). There is no indication of any missing functionality or issues with the provided inputs being invalid under the given assumptions. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
