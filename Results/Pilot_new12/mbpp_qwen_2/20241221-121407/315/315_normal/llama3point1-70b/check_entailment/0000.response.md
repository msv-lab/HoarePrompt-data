Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that contains the original list concatenated with the tuple converted to a list. This implementation correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. Hereâ€™s why:

- It handles tuples of any length and converts them into a list before concatenation.
- It works for any type of elements within the tuple (integers, strings, etc.), as long as they can be appended to a list.
- There are no edge cases or limitations mentioned in the problem description that this function would fail to handle.

Since the function performs the required operation correctly for all tested scenarios, the correctness is **True**.
