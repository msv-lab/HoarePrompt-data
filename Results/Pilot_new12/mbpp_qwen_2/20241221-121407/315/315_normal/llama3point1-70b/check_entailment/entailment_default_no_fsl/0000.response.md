Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs, converts the tuple into a list, and concatenates it with the input list. This approach ensures that the tuple is added to the list as intended. The function handles all potential cases correctly, including the scenario where the tuple is empty (resulting in no change to the list) and the scenario where the list is empty (resulting in the list representation of the tuple). Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
