Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the converted tuple to a list. This implementation correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function works as expected for any valid list and tuple inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
