Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to add a given tuple to a given list. The annotations clearly state that the function converts the tuple into a list and concatenates it with the input list, producing the expected result. Since the function handles all potential cases without any limitations or edge cases mentioned, and the provided code aligns with the problem description, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
