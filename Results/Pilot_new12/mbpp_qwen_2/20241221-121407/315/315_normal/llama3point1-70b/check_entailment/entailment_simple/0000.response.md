Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program meets the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `input_list`, which is expected to be a list, and `input_tuple`, which is expected to be a tuple. The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and a list converted from `input_tuple`.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Types**: The function correctly accepts a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`) as inputs, which matches the problem description.
2. **Operation**: The function converts the tuple to a list using `list(input_tuple)` and then concatenates it with `input_list` using the `+` operator. This operation results in a new list that contains all elements from `input_list` followed by all elements from `input_tuple`.
3. **Output Type**: The output is a list, which is consistent with the problem description.

Since the program performs the required operation without any assumptions beyond the valid inputs specified in the problem description, it can be considered correct.
