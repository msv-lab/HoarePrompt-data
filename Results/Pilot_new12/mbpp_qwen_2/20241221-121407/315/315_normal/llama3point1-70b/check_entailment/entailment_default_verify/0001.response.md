Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly concatenates a tuple (converted to a list) with a given list, adhering to the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, including edge cases such as an empty tuple or an empty list. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
