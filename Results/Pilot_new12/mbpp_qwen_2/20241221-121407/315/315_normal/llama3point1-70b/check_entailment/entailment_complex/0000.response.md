Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `input_list`, which is a list, and `input_tuple`, which is a tuple. The function converts `input_tuple` into a list and then concatenates it with `input_list`. The resulting list is returned. This exactly matches the requirement to add the given tuple to the given list. The program handles all cases correctly, including when the tuple is empty (in which case no elements are added to the list) or when the list is empty (in which case the tuple's elements are added). There are no missing functionalities, and the provided explanation in the comments accurately reflects the behavior of the function.
