The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `input_list`, which is a list, and `input_tuple`, which is a tuple. It converts `input_tuple` into a list and then concatenates it with `input_list`. The function returns a new list that is the result of this concatenation. Potential edge cases include the possibility that `input_tuple` is empty, in which case the returned list will simply be `input_list`. If `input_list` is also empty, the returned list will be the list representation of `input_tuple`. No missing functionality was observed in the provided code.
