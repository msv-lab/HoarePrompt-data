The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`. It converts the tuple `tpl` into a list, then concatenates this new list with the original list `lst`. The function returns a single list that is the result of this concatenation. This process handles all elements in both `lst` and `tpl`, converting tuples to lists when necessary. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that require special handling, as the function straightforwardly concatenates the two inputs.
