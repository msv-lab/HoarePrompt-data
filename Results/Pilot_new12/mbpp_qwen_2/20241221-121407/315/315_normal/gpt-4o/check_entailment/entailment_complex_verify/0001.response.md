Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the converted tuple to a list. The provided test cases in the form of assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected. The annotations provided clarify that the function correctly converts the tuple to a list and then concatenates it with the original list. Since there are no edge cases or potential issues highlighted in the annotations, and the provided test cases cover typical usage scenarios, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
