Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl`. The provided annotations correctly describe the state of the program and the behavior of the function. The examples given in the assertions also confirm that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
