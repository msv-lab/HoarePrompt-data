Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`) as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl`. This is achieved by converting the tuple `tpl` to a list using `list(tpl)` and then concatenating it with `lst` using the `+` operator.

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` results in `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
- `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` results in `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
- `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` results in `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

Since the function correctly concatenates the list and the tuple for the given test cases, and there are no constraints or edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the function needs to handle (such as invalid inputs), the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
