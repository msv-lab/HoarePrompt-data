Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple into a list, and then concatenates it with the original list. This behavior directly aligns with the problem description of adding the given tuple to the given list. The provided output hints confirm that the function works as intended, converting tuples to lists and concatenating them with the original list. Since the function handles the inputs as specified and produces the correct outputs for the given assertions, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
