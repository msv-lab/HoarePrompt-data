Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the converted tuple to a list. The assertions provided in the test cases verify that the function works correctly for the given inputs. Since the function logic is straightforward and the provided test cases cover typical usage scenarios, there doesn't appear to be any edge cases or potential issues with the current implementation. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.
