Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl`. This behavior matches the problem description, which states that we need to add the given tuple to the given list. The examples provided also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since there is no case found where the program does not work as described, the function is correct.
