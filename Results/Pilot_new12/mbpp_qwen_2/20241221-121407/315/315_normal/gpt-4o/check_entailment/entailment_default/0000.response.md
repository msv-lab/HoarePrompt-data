Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as inputs. It converts the tuple `tpl` into a list and then concatenates it with the original list `lst`. The function returns the resulting list. Based on the problem description and the provided assertions, the function correctly adds the elements of the tuple to the end of the list. The code handles all cases where the inputs are a valid list and a valid tuple without any issues. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
