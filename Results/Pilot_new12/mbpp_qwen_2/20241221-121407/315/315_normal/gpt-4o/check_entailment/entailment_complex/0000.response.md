Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`) as arguments, converts the tuple to a list, and then concatenates the two lists together. This process ensures that all elements from both the original list and the tuple are included in the final list.

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`
- `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`
- `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`

Since the function consistently performs the required operation of adding the tuple to the list, the program is correct according to the problem description.
