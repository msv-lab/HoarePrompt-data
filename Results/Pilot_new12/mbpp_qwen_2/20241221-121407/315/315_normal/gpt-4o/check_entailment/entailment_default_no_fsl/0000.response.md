Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` to add the elements of a given tuple to a given list. The function converts the tuple to a list and then concatenates it with the original list. This approach works for all potential cases where the inputs are a list and a tuple containing any number of elements. The examples provided in the problem description and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected in all tested scenarios. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
