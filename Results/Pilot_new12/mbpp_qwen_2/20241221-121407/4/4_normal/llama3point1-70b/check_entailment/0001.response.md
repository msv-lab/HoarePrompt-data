Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by performing a bitwise XOR operation and then counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. If the count is exactly 1, it means the numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This approach correctly handles all potential cases, as it accurately determines whether the two numbers have a Hamming distance of 1. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
