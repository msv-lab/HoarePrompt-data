Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` performs a bitwise XOR operation on `num1` and `num2`, converts the result to its binary representation, and counts the number of '1's. The function returns `True` if there is exactly one '1', indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This aligns perfectly with the problem description. Since the inputs are assumed to be valid non-negative integers, the function will behave as expected for all valid inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
