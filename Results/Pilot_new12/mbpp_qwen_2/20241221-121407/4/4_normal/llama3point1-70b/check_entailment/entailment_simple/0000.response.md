Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes two non-negative integers, `num1` and `num2`, performs a bitwise XOR operation (`^`) between them, converts the result to its binary representation using `bin()`, and then counts the number of '1's in this binary string. The function returns `True` if there is exactly one '1' in the binary representation, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This matches the requirement of checking whether two numbers differ at one bit position only. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
