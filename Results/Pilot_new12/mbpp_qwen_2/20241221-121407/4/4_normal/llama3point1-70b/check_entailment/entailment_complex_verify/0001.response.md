Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether two non-negative integers differ at exactly one bit position by performing a bitwise XOR operation and then counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. The annotation confirms that the function returns `True` if the binary representation of `(num1 XOR num2)` contains exactly one '1', and `False` otherwise. This approach accurately determines whether the two numbers have a Hamming distance of 1. The function handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases where either `num1` or `num2` is zero, or both are the same value (which results in all zeros in the XOR operation). Since the problem description specifies non-negative integers and the function behaves as expected for these inputs, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
