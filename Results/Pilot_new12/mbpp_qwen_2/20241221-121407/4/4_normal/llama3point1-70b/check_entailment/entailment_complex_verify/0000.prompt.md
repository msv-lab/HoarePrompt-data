You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by performing a bitwise XOR operation and counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. This approach is correct because:
- The XOR operation between two bits results in '1' only if the bits are different.
- Counting exactly one '1' in the binary representation of the XOR result means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

Given this logic, the function will work correctly for all potential cases as long as the inputs are valid integers. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are non-negative integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if the binary representation of (num1 XOR num2) contains exactly one '1', otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`. It performs an XOR operation between `num1` and `num2`, converts the result to its binary representation, and checks if this binary string contains exactly one '1'. If the condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when either `num1` or `num2` is zero, or when both are the same value (resulting in all zeros in the XOR operation). The function does not handle cases where `num1` or `num2` are negative integers, which would result in a TypeError.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
