Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position using a bitwise XOR operation followed by counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. The output hints confirm that the function handles the basic requirements and potential edge cases such as when either `num1` or `num2` is zero or when both are the same value. While the function does not explicitly handle negative integers, the problem description specifies that the inputs are non-negative integers, so this omission does not affect the correctness of the program within the given constraints. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
