Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two non-negative integers differ at exactly one bit position by performing an XOR operation and then counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. The function returns `True` if the count is exactly one and `False` otherwise. The output hints confirm that the function handles the edge cases where either `num1` or `num2` is zero, or both are the same value, which results in all zeros in the XOR operation. Additionally, the hints note that the function does not handle negative integers, but since the problem description specifies non-negative integers, this is not a concern. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
