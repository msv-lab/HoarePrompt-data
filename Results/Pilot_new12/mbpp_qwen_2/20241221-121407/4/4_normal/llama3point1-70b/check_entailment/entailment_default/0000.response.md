Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`, performs an XOR operation on them, converts the result to its binary representation, and counts the number of '1's in the binary string. If the count is exactly 1, the function returns `True`, indicating that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function handles the following cases correctly:
- When `num1` and `num2` are different and differ at exactly one bit position.
- When `num1` and `num2` are the same, resulting in a binary string of all zeros.
- When either `num1` or `num2` is zero.
- When both `num1` and `num2` are the same non-zero value.

There are no negative integers or other invalid inputs mentioned in the problem description, and the function does not need to handle those cases as per the assumptions provided. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case specified in the problem description.
