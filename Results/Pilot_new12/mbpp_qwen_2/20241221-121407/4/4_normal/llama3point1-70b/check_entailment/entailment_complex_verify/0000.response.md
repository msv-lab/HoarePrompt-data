Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two non-negative integers differ at exactly one bit position by using a bitwise XOR operation and counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as intended under the assumption that the inputs are valid non-negative integers. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the inputs are negative, but the original problem description assumes valid inputs, so this omission does not affect the correctness assessment. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
