Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by performing a bitwise XOR operation and counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. This approach is correct because:
- The XOR operation between two bits results in '1' only if the bits are different.
- Counting exactly one '1' in the binary representation of the XOR result means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

Given this logic, the function will work correctly for all potential cases as long as the inputs are valid integers. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
