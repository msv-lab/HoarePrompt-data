Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`, performs an XOR operation on them, converts the result to its binary representation, and counts the number of '1's in that binary string. If the count is exactly one, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The solution handles the following aspects as required:

1. **XOR Operation**: The XOR operation (`num1 ^ num2`) correctly identifies positions where the bits of `num1` and `num2` differ.
2. **Binary Conversion and Counting**: Converting the result of the XOR operation to its binary form and counting the number of '1's ensures that the function checks if there is exactly one differing bit position.
3. **Edge Cases**: While the problem description mentions potential edge cases such as when either `num1` or `num2` is zero or both are the same value (resulting in all zeros), the program inherently handles these by returning `False` in such scenarios, which aligns with the problem description's requirement to return `False` if the two numbers do not differ at exactly one bit position.

Since the program meets the criteria outlined in the problem description for all valid inputs, the correctness of the program is **True**.
