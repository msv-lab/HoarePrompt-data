Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using a bitwise XOR operation and then counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. The annotation confirms that the function returns `True` if the binary representation of `(num1 XOR num2)` contains exactly one '1', and `False` otherwise. This matches the problem description perfectly, and there are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail under the assumption of valid and non-negative integer inputs.
