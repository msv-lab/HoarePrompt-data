The code snippet performs a bitwise XOR operation between `a` and `b`, storing the result in `xor_result`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. The value of `xor_result` is the result of `a ^ b`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `xor_result` is a = b ^ a**
