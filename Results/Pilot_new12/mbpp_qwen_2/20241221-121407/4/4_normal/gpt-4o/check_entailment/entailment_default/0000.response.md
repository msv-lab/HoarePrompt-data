Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The function computes the XOR of the two numbers and then checks if the result is a power of 2. This is achieved by verifying that the XOR result is not zero and that `xor_result & (xor_result - 1)` equals zero. This condition ensures that the XOR result has exactly one bit set, meaning the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. All the provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected for the given examples. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
