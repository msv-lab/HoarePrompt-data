Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given program implements a function `func_1` that correctly checks whether two non-negative integers `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that determines if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This can be achieved by computing the XOR of the two numbers. If the result has exactly one bit set (i.e., it is a power of 2 minus 1), then the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

2. **Implementation**:
   - The function computes the XOR of `a` and `b` and stores the result in `xor_result`.
   - It then checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2 using the condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`. This works because powers of 2 have exactly one bit set to 1 in their binary representation, and subtracting 1 from such a number results in a binary number with all bits set to 1 up to the position of the original bit (e.g., `4 (100)_2 -> 3 (011)_2`).

3. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions cover various cases:
     - `func_1(13, 9)` should return `True` because `13 (1101)_2` and `9 (1001)_2` differ at one bit position.
     - `func_1(15, 8)` should return `False` because `15 (1111)_2` and `8 (1000)_2` differ at more than one bit position.
     - `func_1(2, 4)` should return `False` because `2 (0010)_2` and `4 (0100)_2` differ at more than one bit position.
     - `func_1(2, 3)` should return `True` because `2 (0010)_2` and `3 (0011)_2` differ at one bit position.
     - `func_1(5, 1)` should return `True` because `5 (0101)_2` and `1 (0001)_2` differ at one bit position.
     - `func_1(1, 5)` should return `True` because `1 (0001)_2` and `5 (0101)_2` differ at one bit position.

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required by the problem description, and the provided assertions validate its correctness for various inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
