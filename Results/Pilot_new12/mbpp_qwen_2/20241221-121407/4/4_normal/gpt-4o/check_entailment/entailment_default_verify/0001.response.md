Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The XOR operation is used to find differing bits, and the additional condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` ensures that the result is a power of two, which means there is exactly one bit set in the XOR result. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and validate the function's correctness. The output hints also align with the functionality and behavior of the provided code. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
