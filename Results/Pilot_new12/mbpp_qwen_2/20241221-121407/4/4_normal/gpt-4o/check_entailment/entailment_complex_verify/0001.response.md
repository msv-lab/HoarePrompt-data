Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the provided test cases confirm that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The function uses the XOR operation to identify differing bits and then checks if the result is a power of two, which indicates exactly one differing bit. All the provided test cases correctly validate the function's behavior. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
