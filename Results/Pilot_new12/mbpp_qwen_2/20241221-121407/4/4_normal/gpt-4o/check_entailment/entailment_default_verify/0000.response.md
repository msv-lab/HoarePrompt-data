Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The provided output hints confirm that the function computes the XOR of the two numbers and checks if the result is a power of 2 by verifying that `xor_result & (xor_result - 1)` equals zero. This approach ensures that the function returns `True` only if the XOR result has exactly one bit set, which aligns with the problem description. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
