Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the function `func_1`. The function correctly uses the XOR operation to identify differing bits between two numbers and then checks if the result is a power of two, which confirms that the numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The provided test cases in the assertions are correctly handled by the function, and the logic is sound. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
