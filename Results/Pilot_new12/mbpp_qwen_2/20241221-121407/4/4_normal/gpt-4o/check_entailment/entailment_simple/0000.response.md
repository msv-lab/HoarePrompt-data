Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Here's why:

1. **XOR Operation**: 
   - The XOR operation (`a ^ b`) between two numbers `a` and `b` results in a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are different, and 0 if they are the same.
   - For example:
     - `13 (1101)_2` XOR `9 (1001)_2` = `0100` (4 in decimal)
     - `15 (1111)_2` XOR `8 (1000)_2` = `0111` (7 in decimal)
     - `2 (0010)_2` XOR `4 (0100)_2` = `0110` (6 in decimal)
     - `2 (0010)_2` XOR `3 (0011)_2` = `0001` (1 in decimal)
     - `5 (0101)_2` XOR `1 (0001)_2` = `0100` (4 in decimal)

2. **Power of Two Check**:
   - A number is a power of 2 if it has exactly one bit set to 1 in its binary representation. For instance, 1 (0001), 2 (0010), 4 (0100), etc., all have this property.
   - The condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if the XOR result has exactly one bit set to 1. If `xor_result` is a power of 2, subtracting 1 from it will flip all the bits after the highest set bit, and performing the bitwise AND with `xor_result` will yield 0.
   - For example:
     - `4 (0100)_2` & `3 (0011)_2` = `0000` (0 in decimal)
     - `7 (0111)_2` & `6 (0110)_2` = `0110` (not 0)
     - `1 (0001)_2` & `0 (0000)_2` = `0000` (0 in decimal)

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
     - `func_1(13, 9)` should return `True` because `13 ^ 9 = 4`, and 4 is a power of 2.
     - `func_1(15, 8)` should return `False` because `15 ^ 8 = 7`, and 7 is not a power of 2.
     - `func_1(2, 4)` should return `False` because `2 ^ 4 = 6`, and 6 is not a power of 2.
     - `func_1(2, 3)` should return `True` because `2 ^ 3 = 1`, and 1 is a power of 2.
     - `func_1(5, 1)` should return `True` because `5 ^ 1 = 4`, and 4 is a power of 2.
     - `func_1(1, 5)` should return `True` because `1 ^ 5 = 4`, and 4 is a power of 2.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
