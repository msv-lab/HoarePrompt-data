Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. It uses the XOR operation to find differing bits and then checks if the result has exactly one bit set. The function correctly returns `True` for the provided assertions and should work for all cases where the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position and `False` otherwise. There are no potential cases found where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description.
