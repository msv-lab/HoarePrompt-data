Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of the logic used in the function `func_1`. The function correctly uses the XOR operation to find the differing bits between two numbers and then checks if the result has exactly one bit set, which is verified by the condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`. This condition ensures that the result of the XOR operation is a power of 2, meaning the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program is correct.
