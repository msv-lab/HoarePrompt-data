Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The logic uses the XOR operation to find differing bits and then checks if the result is a power of two (which would indicate exactly one differing bit). All the test cases provided in the assertions are correctly handled by the function. Since the function works for the given test cases and the logic is sound, it can be concluded that the program is correct for the described problem.
