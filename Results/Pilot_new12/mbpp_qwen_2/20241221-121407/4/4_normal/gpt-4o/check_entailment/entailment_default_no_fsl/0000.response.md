Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The function `func_1` uses the XOR operation to find the positions where the bits differ between the two numbers. It then checks if the result of the XOR operation is a power of 2, which indicates that exactly one bit is set in the result. This approach is valid for all non-negative integers and works for all the provided test cases. The output hints also confirm this behavior, so the code is correct for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
