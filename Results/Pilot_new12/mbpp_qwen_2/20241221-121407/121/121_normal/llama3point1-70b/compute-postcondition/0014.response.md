Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 7. The function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True, implying that the current value of `num` is either 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6, and `count` is not equal to `n`. Since there is no else part, the final values remain as specified in the if part.***
