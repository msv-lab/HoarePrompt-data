`num` is incremented by 1. The value of `num` was already increased by 1 in the initial state, so it is increased by 1 again. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1; `num` is increased by 1 twice; `count` is incremented by 1 if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5; if `count` equals `n`, the function returns `num`; if `func_1(num)` is false, the function continues with the original state where `count` is incremented by 1.**
