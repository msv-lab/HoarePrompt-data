The given code snippet is a docstring that describes the purpose of finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number but does not actually execute any code to find or store such a prime number. The only variable mentioned in the initial state is `n`, which is a positive integer, and this variable is not modified within the provided code.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer.**
