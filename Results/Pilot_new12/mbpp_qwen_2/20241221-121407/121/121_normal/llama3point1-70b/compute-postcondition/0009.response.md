`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is still 7, the function `func_1(num)` still evaluates to True, and `num` is still either 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 7, the function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True, the current value of `num` is either 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6**
