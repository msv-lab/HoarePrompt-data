The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given that the initial state of `num` is 7, after executing this line, `num` becomes 8. The values of `n`, `count`, and the function evaluation remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 8. The function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True, implying that the current value of `num` is either 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6, and `count` is not equal to `n`.**
