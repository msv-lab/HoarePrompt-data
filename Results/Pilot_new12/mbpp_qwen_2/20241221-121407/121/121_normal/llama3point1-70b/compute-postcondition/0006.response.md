According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute because it is an infinite loop. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary since the loop will definitely execute one more time regardless of the current values of `n`, `count`, and `num`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 7**
