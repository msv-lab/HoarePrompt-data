Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1.
   - `num` is increased by 1.
   - `count` is increased by 1 if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop is a `while True` loop, meaning it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as there is no explicit exit condition provided within the loop.

3. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute at least one more time unless explicitly stopped from within the loop.
   - There are no conditions given that would prevent the loop from executing again, such as updating a variable that would change the loop's behavior (e.g., setting a variable to stop the loop).

4. **Conclusion:**
   - Given that the loop is `while True`, we do not need to adjust any of the states to ensure it executes one more time. The loop will always proceed to the next iteration regardless of the current values of `n`, `num`, or `count`.

Therefore, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

**State: **The same as the end of the previous iteration: `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1; `num` is increased by 1; `count` is increased by 1 if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.**
