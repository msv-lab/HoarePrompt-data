Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 7, the function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True. The current value of `num` is either 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6, and `count` is not equal to `n` since there is no else part where `count` could be updated further.***
