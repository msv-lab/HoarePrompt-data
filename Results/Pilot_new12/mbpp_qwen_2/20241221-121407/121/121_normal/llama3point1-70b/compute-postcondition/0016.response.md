Let's analyze the given `while True` loop and the provided information step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1.
   - `count` is 2.
   - `num` is 8.
   - `func_1(num)` evaluates to True, meaning `num` is either 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6. Given `num` is 8, we can confirm this since \(8 = 6 + 2\) (not exactly 1 more or 5 more, but let's assume the function logic applies here as stated).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute at least one more time as long as there are no explicit exit conditions within the loop body.
   - The only state that could potentially change in the next iteration is `count` and `num`, but the problem statement does not provide any information about how these values change inside the loop body. Therefore, we cannot make any assumptions about their values in the next iteration.
   - The only state that remains constant and is relevant to the loop condition itself is `n`, which must remain a positive integer and not equal to 1.

Given that the loop will execute one more time regardless of the current state of `count` and `num` (as long as `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1), we don't need to adjust these states.

**Conclusion:**
The only state that needs to be ensured is that `n` remains a positive integer and not equal to 1.

**Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1**
