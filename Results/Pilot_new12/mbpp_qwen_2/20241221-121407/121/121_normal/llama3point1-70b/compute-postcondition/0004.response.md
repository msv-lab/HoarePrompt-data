The code initializes `count` to 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as no operation affects it directly in this snippet. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `count` is now set to 1 while `n` retains its original state of being a positive integer not equal to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is 1**
