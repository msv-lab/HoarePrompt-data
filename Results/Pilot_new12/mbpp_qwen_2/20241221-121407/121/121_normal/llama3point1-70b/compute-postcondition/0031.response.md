The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. 

- Case_1: The function returns 7.
- Case_2: The function returns 7, which is either 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6.
- Case_3: The function returns `num`, which is a positive integer and not equal to 1.
- Case_4: The function returns `num`, which has been increased by 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 7, a number that is 1 or 5 more than a multiple of 6, a positive integer not equal to 1, or a number increased by 1.
