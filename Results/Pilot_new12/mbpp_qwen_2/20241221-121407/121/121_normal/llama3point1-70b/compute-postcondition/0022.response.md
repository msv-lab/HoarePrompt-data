The code `num += 1` increments the value of `num` by 1. Given the initial state, `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, and `count` is increased by 1 if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5. There is no return value specified in the code snippet, so the value of `num` is updated, and the conditions for `count` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1; `num` is increased by 1; `count` is increased by 1 if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.**
