Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1. `num` is increased by 1. `count` is incremented by 1 if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5. If `count` equals `n`, the function returns `num`. If `func_1(num)` is false, the function continues with the original state where `count` is incremented by 1.***
