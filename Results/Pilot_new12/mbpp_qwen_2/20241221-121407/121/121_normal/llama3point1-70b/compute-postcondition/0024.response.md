`count` is incremented by 1. The previous state was that `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1; `num` is increased by 1; `count` is increased by 1 if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5. After the increment, `count` is now increased by 1 from its previous state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1; `num` is increased by 1; `count` is increased by 1 if `num % 6` is either 1 or 5; `count` is incremented by 1**
