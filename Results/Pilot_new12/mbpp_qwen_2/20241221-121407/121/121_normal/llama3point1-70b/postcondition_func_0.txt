The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, `i`], where `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`. If `n` passes all checks, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function covers the edge case where `n` is less than 2 by immediately returning `False`.
