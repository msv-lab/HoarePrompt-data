#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, `i`], where `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`. If `n` passes all checks, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function covers the edge case where `n` is less than 2 by immediately returning `False`.

    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is equal to `n`, `num` is either 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6, `func_1(num)` evaluates to True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a specific Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number based on the value of `n`. Specifically:

- If `n` is 1, the function returns 7.
- For `n > 1`, the function iterates starting from 7 and checks each subsequent number to determine if it meets the criteria of being a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime (i.e., `func_1(num)` returns True and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5). Once it finds the `n`-th such number, it returns that number.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 1, the function directly returns 7 without entering the loop.
- If no valid Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is found within the range checked (which theoretically should not happen given the nature of the problem), the function will continue to increment `num` indefinitely, returning a number that is either 1 or 5 more than a multiple of 6, as per the loop condition.
