Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The annotations provided describe the behavior of the functions `func_1` and `func_2` accurately. However, the original assessment is correct because `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic required to identify Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The function `func_2` generates prime numbers in a sequence starting from 7 and checks if they are of the form 6kÂ±1, but it does not verify if these primes satisfy the specific conditions related to quadratic residues modulo primes of the form 8k+1. This is a necessary condition for a number to be a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. Since `func_2` fails to check this condition, it cannot accurately find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime for all inputs. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
