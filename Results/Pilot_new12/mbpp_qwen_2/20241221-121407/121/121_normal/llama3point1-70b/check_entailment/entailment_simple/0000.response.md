Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Prime Check Function (`func_1`)**:
   - The function `func_1` checks if a given number `n` is a prime number. It correctly returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and uses an efficient method to check divisibility up to the square root of `n`.
   - This function is used to verify whether a number is a prime number, which is essential for finding Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.

2. **Newman-Shanks-Williams Prime Finder (`func_2`)**:
   - The function `func_2` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. It starts with the known first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, which is 7, and then iterates through subsequent numbers checking if they meet the criteria:
     - They must be prime.
     - They must be congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.

3. **Algorithm**:
   - The function `func_2` uses a `while True` loop to continuously check each successive number starting from 7.
   - For each number, it first checks if the number is prime using `func_1`. If it is, it then checks if the number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.
   - Once it finds the nth such prime, it returns the number.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the base case correctly when `n` is 1 by returning the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, which is 7.
   - The loop ensures that it continues to check subsequent numbers until it finds the nth valid prime.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the algorithm to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
