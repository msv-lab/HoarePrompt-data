Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence. The sequence is defined such that each term \( p_n \) is the smallest prime \( p \) greater than \( p_{n-1} \) that satisfies the condition \( p \equiv 1, 5 \pmod{6} \). However, the current implementation in `func_2` does not guarantee that the prime found is the next term in the sequence after \( p_{n-1} \). For instance, if \( n = 2 \), the expected result should be the second prime in the sequence, which is 41, but the function returns 11. This is because the function increments `num` until a prime is found without ensuring it is the next term in the sequence.
