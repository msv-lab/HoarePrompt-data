Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the program. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_2` does not ensure that the prime number returned is the next term in the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence after \( p_{n-1} \). Specifically, the function simply finds the smallest prime number greater than 7 (or the subsequent primes if \( n > 1 \)) that satisfies the condition \( p \equiv 1, 5 \pmod{6} \), without checking if it is the next term in the sequence. For instance, when \( n = 2 \), the expected result should be 41, but the function returns 11, which is not the correct term in the sequence. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
