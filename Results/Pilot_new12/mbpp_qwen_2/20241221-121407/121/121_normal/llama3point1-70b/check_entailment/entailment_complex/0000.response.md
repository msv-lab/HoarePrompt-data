Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_2` is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen if `n` is less than 1. According to the annotations, if `n` is 1, the function returns 7. This is consistent with the problem description, but the annotations do not cover the case when `n` is less than 1.

Given the problem description, if `n` is less than 1, the function should handle this case appropriately. Since the problem description does not explicitly state how to handle such cases, we can infer that the function should return an error or a specific value to indicate an invalid input. However, the current implementation of `func_2` does not handle this case, which means it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

To correct this, the function could include a check at the beginning to handle the case where `n` is less than 1, such as raising an exception or returning a specific error message. For example:

```python
def func_2(n):
    if n < 1:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    # Rest of the function
```

Since the current implementation does not handle the case where `n` is less than 1, the code is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
