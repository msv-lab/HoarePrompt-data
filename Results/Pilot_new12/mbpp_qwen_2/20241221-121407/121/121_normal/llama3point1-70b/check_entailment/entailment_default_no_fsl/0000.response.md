Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code for `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic for finding Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence is defined such that each term is of the form \( a^2 + ab + b^2 \) where \( a \) and \( b \) are integers. The sequence starts with 7, and the next few terms are 43, 67, 163, etc. However, the current implementation simply checks if a number is prime and if it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, which is a necessary but not sufficient condition for a number to be in the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence.

For example, the number 49 is congruent to 1 modulo 6 and is also prime, so it would be incorrectly identified as a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime under this logic. Therefore, the program does not correctly generate the sequence of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes for every potential case.
