You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Functions with output description for each function:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, `i`], where `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`. If `n` passes all checks, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function covers the edge case where `n` is less than 2 by immediately returning `False`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a specific Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number based on the value of `n`. Specifically:

- If `n` is 1, the function returns 7.
- For `n > 1`, the function iterates starting from 7 and checks each subsequent number to determine if it meets the criteria of being a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime (i.e., `func_1(num)` returns True and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5). Once it finds the `n`-th such number, it returns that number.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 1, the function directly returns 7 without entering the loop.
- If no valid Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is found within the range checked (which theoretically should not happen given the nature of the problem), the function will continue to increment `num` indefinitely, returning a number that is either 1 or 5 more than a multiple of 6, as per the loop condition.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
