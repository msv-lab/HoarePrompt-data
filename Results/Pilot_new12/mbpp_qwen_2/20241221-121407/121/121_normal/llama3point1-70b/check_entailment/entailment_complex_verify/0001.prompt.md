You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic for identifying Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The function `func_2` generates prime numbers in a sequence starting from 7 and checks if they are of the form 6k±1. This is not sufficient to identify Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, which have a more specific definition related to quadratic residues modulo primes of the form 8k+1.

For instance, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are 7, 23, 79, 223, etc., but the program will generate primes of the form 6k±1 without checking if they satisfy the specific conditions required for Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. Therefore, the program will not correctly identify the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime for all inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and the function returns True if `n` is not divisible by any integer in the range [2, `i`].
    return True
    #The program returns True if `n` is not divisible by any integer in the range [2, `i`], where `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and determines whether `n` is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, `i`], where `i` is the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`. If `n` passes all checks, it returns `True`, indicating that `n` is a prime number. The function covers the edge case where `n` is less than 2 by immediately returning `False`.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns 7
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, and `n` is not equal to 1
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `count` is equal to `n`, `num` is either 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6, `func_1(num)` evaluates to True.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a specific Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number based on the value of `n`. Specifically:

- If `n` is 1, the function returns 7.
- For `n > 1`, the function iterates starting from 7 and checks each subsequent number to determine if it meets the criteria of being a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime (i.e., `func_1(num)` returns True and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5). Once it finds the `n`-th such number, it returns that number.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 1, the function directly returns 7 without entering the loop.
- If no valid Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is found within the range checked (which theoretically should not happen given the nature of the problem), the function will continue to increment `num` indefinitely, returning a number that is either 1 or 5 more than a multiple of 6, as per the loop condition.



Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
