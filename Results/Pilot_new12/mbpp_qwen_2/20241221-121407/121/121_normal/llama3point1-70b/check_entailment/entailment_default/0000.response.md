Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code for `func_2` does not handle the case when `n` is 1 correctly. According to the problem description, `func_2` should return the 1st Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is 7. However, the code provided does not directly handle this case; instead, it enters the loop and checks if 7 is a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, which is true, and then increments the count. This means that even though the code eventually returns 7, it does so after performing unnecessary iterations, which is not optimal. Moreover, the problem description asks for the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, and the provided code correctly handles this for `n > 1`, but it fails to handle the case when `n` is 1 efficiently.

To fix this, the code should directly return 7 when `n` is 1, without entering the loop. Here is an example of how the code could be modified:

```python
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while count < n:
        num += 6  # Ensure the next number is 1 or 5 more than a multiple of 6
        if func_1(num):
            count += 1
    return num
```

This modified version ensures that the function correctly returns the 1st Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number when `n` is 1 without unnecessary iterations.
