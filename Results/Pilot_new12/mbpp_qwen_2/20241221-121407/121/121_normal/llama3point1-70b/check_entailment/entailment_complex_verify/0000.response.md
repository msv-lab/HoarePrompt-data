Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence. While the function checks if a number is prime using `func_1` and ensures that the number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, it does not guarantee that the returned number is the next term in the sequence after \( p_{n-1} \). The loop simply increments `num` until it finds a prime that meets the modulo condition, which does not ensure the sequence property. For instance, if \( n = 2 \), the function should return 41, which is the second term in the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence, but instead, it returns 11, which is not the next term in the sequence. Therefore, the original assessment remains correct.
