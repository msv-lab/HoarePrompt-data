Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not meet the problem description. The function `func_2` generates prime numbers of the form 6k±1 starting from 7, but it does not check whether these numbers satisfy the specific conditions required for Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The output hints confirm that the function continues to check each subsequent prime number for the form 6k±1, but this does not ensure that the generated primes are Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. 

Therefore, the program will not correctly identify the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime for all inputs, and the original assessment is accurate.
