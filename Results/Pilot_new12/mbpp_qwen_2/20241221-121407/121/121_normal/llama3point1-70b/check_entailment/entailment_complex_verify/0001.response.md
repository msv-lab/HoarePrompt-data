Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The program attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number by generating prime numbers and checking if they are of the form 6k±1. However, this approach is incorrect because Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are defined in a more specific way. They are related to quadratic residues modulo primes of the form 8k+1, and simply checking if a prime is of the form 6k±1 does not satisfy these specific conditions. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic for identifying Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, thus maintaining the original assessment.
