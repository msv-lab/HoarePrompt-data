Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the program does not correctly implement the logic for identifying Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The function `func_2` generates prime numbers in a sequence starting from 7 and checks if they are of the form 6k±1. This is not sufficient to identify Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, which have a more specific definition related to quadratic residues modulo primes of the form 8k+1.

For instance, the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are 7, 23, 79, 223, etc., but the program will generate primes of the form 6k±1 without checking if they satisfy the specific conditions required for Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. Therefore, the program will not correctly identify the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime for all inputs.
