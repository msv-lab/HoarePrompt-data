The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns a specific Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number based on the value of `n`. Specifically:

- If `n` is 1, the function returns 7.
- For `n > 1`, the function iterates starting from 7 and checks each subsequent number to determine if it meets the criteria of being a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime (i.e., `func_1(num)` returns True and `num % 6` is either 1 or 5). Once it finds the `n`-th such number, it returns that number.

Potential edge cases:
- If `n` is 1, the function directly returns 7 without entering the loop.
- If no valid Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is found within the range checked (which theoretically should not happen given the nature of the problem), the function will continue to increment `num` indefinitely, returning a number that is either 1 or 5 more than a multiple of 6, as per the loop condition.
