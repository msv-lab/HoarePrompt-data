The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function returns 1 in the first case. In the second case, the function returns `S1` which is calculated as \(2 \times S1 + S0\) for each iteration, starting with \(i = n\) and \(n\) being at least 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 1 or \(S1\) based on the given conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, returns 1 in the first case, and returns `S1` which is calculated as \(2 \times S1 + S0\) for each iteration starting with \(i = n\) and \(n\) being at least 2 in the second case.**
