Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state given is:
   - `n` is a positive integer that is neither 0 nor 1.
   - `S0` is 1.
   - `S1` is 1.

2. **For Loop Statement**: The loop statement is:
   ```
   for i in range(2, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 2` and continues until `i` reaches `n + 1`.
   - For the loop to start executing, the condition `2 <= i < n + 1` must be true when `i` starts its first iteration.
   - Since the loop starts with `i = 2`, we need to ensure that `2 <= n`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - From the initial state, we know `n` is a positive integer that is neither 0 nor 1, so `n` must be at least 2 (since `n` cannot be 1).
   - Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to start.

5. **Conclusion**:
   - The variable `S0` and `S1` do not affect the loop's execution directly based on the given loop condition.
   - The only state that needs adjustment is ensuring `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`n` must be at least 2**.
