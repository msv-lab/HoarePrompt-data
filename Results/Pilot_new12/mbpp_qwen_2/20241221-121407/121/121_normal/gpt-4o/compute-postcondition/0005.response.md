`S_next` is assigned the value `2 * S1 + S0`. However, the initial values of `S0` and `S1` are not provided. Since `n` must be at least 2, this condition remains unchanged. The Output State includes the updated value of `S_next` in terms of `S0` and `S1`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `S_next` is `2 * S1 + S0`**
