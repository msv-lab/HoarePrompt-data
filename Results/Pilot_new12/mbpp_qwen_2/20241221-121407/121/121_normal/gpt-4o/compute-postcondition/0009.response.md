The code `S0, S1 = S1, S_next` updates the values of `S0` and `S1`. According to the initial state, `S_next` is defined as `2 * S1 + S0`. The values of `S0` and `S1` are updated as follows:
- The new value of `S0` is the old value of `S1`.
- The new value of `S1` is the old value of `S_next`.

Let's denote the initial values as:
- `S0` is `S1`.
- `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`.

After executing the code, the updated values are:
- New `S0` is `S1`.
- New `S1` is `S_next`, which is `2 * S1 + S0`.

Substituting the initial expressions:
- New `S0` is `S1`.
- New `S1` is `2 * (2 * S1 + S0) + S0`, which simplifies to `4 * S1 + 2 * S0 + S0` or `4 * S1 + 3 * S0`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `S0` is `S1`, `S1` is `4 * S1 + 3 * S0`**.
