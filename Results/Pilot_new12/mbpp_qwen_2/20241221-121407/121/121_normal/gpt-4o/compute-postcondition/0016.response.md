Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input and returns either 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, or the value of `S1` after a series of calculations. Specifically, it initializes `S0` and `S1` to 1 and then iterates from 2 to `n`, updating `S0` and `S1` such that `S1` is set to `2 * S1 + S0` for each iteration. The function returns `S1` after the loop completes. If `n` is 0 or 1, the function directly returns 1 without entering the loop.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 0, the function returns 1.
- If `n` is 1, the function also returns 1.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The annotation suggests that the state of the program after the for loop includes `i` being `n`, which is correct. However, the postcondition regarding the return value of `S1` is accurate, but it does not explicitly mention the initial values of `S0` and `S1` being set to 1, which is crucial for the calculation.**

This summary covers all aspects of the function's behavior, including the initial conditions, the iterative process, and the final return value, while also addressing the edge cases and ensuring that the entire functionality is described accurately.
