According to the provided for loop statement:
```python
for i in range(2, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
At the end of the previous iteration:
- `S0` is updated to `S1`.
- `S1` is updated to `4 * S1 + 3 * S0`.

The loop runs from `2` to `n`, inclusive. Therefore, if the loop needs to execute one more time, the current value of `i` should be one less than the next iteration's starting value, which is `3`. This means the next value of `i` should be `3`.

Since `i` starts from `2` and increments by `1` each time through the loop, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `3`. Additionally, `n` must still be at least `2` for the loop to continue.

The state adjustments required are:
- `i` becomes `3`.
- `n` must still be at least `2`.

Given these adjustments, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**`S0` is `S1`, `S1` is `4 * S1 + 3 * S0`, `i` is `3`, `n` must be at least `2`**.
