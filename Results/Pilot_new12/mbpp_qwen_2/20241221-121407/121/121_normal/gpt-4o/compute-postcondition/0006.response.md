The code `S0, S1 = S1, S_next` swaps the values of `S0` and `S1` with `S1` and `S_next` respectively. According to the initial state, `S_next` is defined as `2 * S1 + S0`. After executing the code, `S0` will take the value of `S1` before the swap, and `S1` will take the value of `S_next`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 2; `S_next` is `2 * S1 + S0`, `S0` is `S1` (before the swap), and `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2; `S_next` is `2 * S1 + S0`, `S0` is `S1`, `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`**
