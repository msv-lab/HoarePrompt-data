Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `S0` is the value of `S1` after the last iteration, `S1` is the value of `S_next` after the last iteration, which is calculated as `2 * S1 + S0` for each iteration.**

To derive this, let's analyze the loop step by step:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `S0 = 1`
   - `S1 = 1`
   - `i = 2` (since the loop starts from 2)

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration of the loop, `S_next` is calculated as `2 * S1 + S0`.
   - After each iteration, `S0` is updated to `S1`, and `S1` is updated to `S_next`.

3. **General Iteration:**
   - Suppose the loop has executed `k` times.
   - After the `k`-th iteration:
     - `S0` will be the value of `S1` from the previous iteration.
     - `S1` will be the value of `S_next` from the previous iteration, which is `2 * S1 + S0` from the previous iteration.

4. **Final Iteration:**
   - When the loop finishes (after `n-1` iterations), `i` will be `n`.
   - `S0` will be the value of `S1` from the previous iteration.
   - `S1` will be the value of `S_next` from the previous iteration, which is `2 * S1 + S0` from the previous iteration.

Given that the loop iterates from 2 to `n`, the final values of `S0` and `S1` will be the result of the last update:
- `S0` will be the value of `S1` from the previous iteration.
- `S1` will be the value of `S_next` from the previous iteration, which is `2 * S1 + S0` from the previous iteration.

Since the loop runs `n-1` times, the final values of `S0` and `S1` will follow the pattern established by the recurrence relation:
- `S0` after `n-1` iterations is the value of `S1` from the previous iteration.
- `S1` after `n-1` iterations is the value of `S_next` from the previous iteration, which is `2 * S1 + S0`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations is:
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` must be at least 2.
- `S0` is the value of `S1` after the last iteration.
- `S1` is the value of `S_next` after the last iteration, which is calculated as `2 * S1 + S0` for each iteration.

Thus, the final output state is:
**Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is at least 2, `S0` is the value of `S1` after the last iteration, `S1` is the value of `S_next` after the last iteration, which is calculated as `2 * S1 + S0` for each iteration.**
