The given code snippet does not contain any actual executable statements within the loop. It only defines the structure of the loop. Based on the provided information, the loop is set to run from `2` to `n`, and at the end of each iteration, the state is updated as follows:

- `S0` is updated to `S1`.
- `S1` is updated to `4 * S1 + 3 * S0`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be `3` (since it starts from `2` and increments by `1`), and `n` must be at least `2`.

Given the state adjustments:

- At the start of the next iteration, `S0` becomes `S1`.
- `S1` becomes `4 * S1 + 3 * S0`.

The state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

- `S0` is `S1`.
- `S1` is `4 * S1 + 3 * S0`.

Additionally, the value of `i` becomes `3`, and `n` must still be at least `2`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`S0` is `S1`, `S1` is `4 * S1 + 3 * S0`, `i` is `3`, `n` is at least `2`**.
