The code updates the value of `S_next` to be `2 * S1 + S0`. According to the initial state, `S_next` is already defined as `2 * S1 + S0`. This means that the value of `S_next` does not change because it is being redefined with the same expression.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `S_next` is `2 * S1 + S0`, `S0` is `S1`, `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `S_next` is `2 * S1 + S0`, `S0` is `S1`, `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`**
