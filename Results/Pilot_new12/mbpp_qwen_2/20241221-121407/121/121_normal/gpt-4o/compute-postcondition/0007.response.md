Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` must be at least 2.
   - `S_next` is `2 * S1 + S0`.
   - `S0` is `S1`.
   - `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `2` to `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of each iteration, `i` is in the range `[2, n]`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - We don't know the exact value of `i` after the previous iteration, but we know it was within the range `[2, n]`.
   - After the previous iteration, the loop would have incremented `i` by 1 if it was less than `n`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.
   - This means that at the start of the next iteration, `i` must be `n` (since `i` was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration).

5. **State Adjustments:**
   - Since `i` must be `n` at the start of the next iteration, we need to update the states accordingly.
   - `S_next`, `S0`, and `S1` will be updated based on the values they hold at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now `n` (since it was `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration).
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `S_next`, `S0`, and `S1` are updated based on their definitions:
     - `S0` is set to the current value of `S1`.
     - `S1` is updated to `2 * S1 + S0`.

Given these points, the final state for the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`i` is `n`, `n` must be at least 2, `S_next` is `2 * S1 + S0`, `S0` is `S1`, `S1` is `2 * S1 + S0`**.
