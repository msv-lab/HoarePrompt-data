The code snippet `S0, S1 = S1, S_next` updates `S0` to be the current value of `S1` and `S1` to be the value of `S_next`. However, the value of `S_next` is not defined in the initial state or within the given code snippet. Since `S_next` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `S0` and `S1` based on the definition in the initial state and the fact that `S1` now takes the value of `S_next`.

Given the initial state:
- `S0` is `S1`
- `S1` is `4 * S1 + 3 * S0`
- `i` is `3`
- `n` is at least `2`

After executing the code snippet:
- `S0` will be the previous value of `S1`
- `S1` will be the value of `S_next`

Since the value of `S_next` is not specified, we express `S1` as `S_next` in the output state.

Output State: **`S0` is `S1`, `S1` is `S_next`, `i` is `3`, `n` is at least `2`**
