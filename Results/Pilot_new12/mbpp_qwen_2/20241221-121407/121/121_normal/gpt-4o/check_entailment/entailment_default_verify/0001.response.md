Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) sequence. Specifically, the function initializes `S0` and `S1` to 1 instead of the required values \( S_0 = 0 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \). This initialization leads to incorrect results for the NSW sequence, which is crucial for generating the NSW primes. The output hints also confirm that the initial values are crucial for the calculation, supporting the original assessment. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and the original assessment is accurate.
