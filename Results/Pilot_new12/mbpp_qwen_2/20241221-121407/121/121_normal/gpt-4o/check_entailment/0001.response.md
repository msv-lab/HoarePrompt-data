Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) sequence. The NSW primes are derived from the NSW sequence, which is defined as follows:

\[ S_0 = 0, \quad S_1 = 1, \quad S_n = 2S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \text{ for } n \geq 2 \]

However, the function starts with \( S_0 = 1 \) and \( S_1 = 1 \), which is incorrect. Additionally, the function returns \( S_1 \) at the end, which is also incorrect because the NSW prime is derived from \( S_{2n-1} \).

For example, let's consider the first few terms of the correct NSW sequence:
- \( S_0 = 0 \)
- \( S_1 = 1 \)
- \( S_2 = 2 \cdot 1 + 0 = 2 \)
- \( S_3 = 2 \cdot 2 + 1 = 5 \)
- \( S_4 = 2 \cdot 5 + 2 = 12 \)
- \( S_5 = 2 \cdot 12 + 5 = 29 \)

The first few NSW primes (derived from \( S_{2n-1} \)) are:
- \( S_1 = 1 \) (not a prime)
- \( S_3 = 5 \)
- \( S_5 = 29 \)
- \( S_7 = 169 \) (not a prime)
- \( S_9 = 985 \)

Based on this, the function should be modified to correctly generate the NSW sequence and return the appropriate NSW prime. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 1  # S_1 is the first NSW prime
    (S0, S1) = (0, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1 if n % 2 == 1 else S0

# Test cases
print(func_1(1))  # Should return 1 (S_1)
print(func_1(3))  # Should return 5 (S_3)
print(func_1(5))  # Should return 29 (S_5)
```

This corrected function now properly generates the NSW sequence and returns the correct NSW prime for the given input.
