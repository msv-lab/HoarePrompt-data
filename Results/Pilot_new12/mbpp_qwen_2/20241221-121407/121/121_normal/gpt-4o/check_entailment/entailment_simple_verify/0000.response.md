Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime sequence. The function instead implements a different linear recurrence relation, which results in values that do not match the expected Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. For example, the annotations show that the function returns 7 for `n = 3`, 17 for `n = 4`, and 41 for `n = 5`, which are not the correct Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. The correct primes are 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, etc. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
