Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program provided calculates the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number using a recurrence relation but does not correctly implement the sequence. The Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are defined as \( p_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 \). However, the provided code uses a linear recurrence relation which does not generate the correct sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

For example, the first few Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are 3, 5, 17, 257, 65537, etc., whereas the provided code generates a different sequence. Specifically:

- For \( n = 3 \), the expected output is 7 (the 3rd Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is \( 2^{2^3} + 1 = 257 \)), but the code returns 7.
- For \( n = 4 \), the expected output is 17 (the 4th Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is \( 2^{2^4} + 1 = 65537 \)), but the code returns 17.
- For \( n = 5 \), the expected output is 41 (which is not a Newman–Shanks–Williams prime, but rather a term in another sequence), but the code returns 41.

The code fails to correctly compute the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, hence it is incorrect.
