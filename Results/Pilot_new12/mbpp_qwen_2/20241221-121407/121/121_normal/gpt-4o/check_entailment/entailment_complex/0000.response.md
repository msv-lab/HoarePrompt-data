Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. According to the problem description, the function should find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, the provided code does not generate these primes; instead, it appears to follow a linear recurrence relation similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different initial conditions.

The function's logic calculates values based on a recurrence relation, but it does not generate Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are generated through a more complex process involving quadratic residues and Legendre symbols, which is not reflected in the given code.

To correctly implement the function, the code would need to use the specific algorithm for generating Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, which is beyond the scope of the simple recurrence relation implemented here. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
