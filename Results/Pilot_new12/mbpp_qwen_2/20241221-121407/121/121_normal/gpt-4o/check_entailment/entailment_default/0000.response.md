Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence. The sequence starts with 2, 5, 11, 29, 59, 149, ... and each term is defined as \(a_n = 2^{2^n} + 1\). The code instead uses a recurrence relation \(S_{next} = 2 \cdot S1 + S0\) with initial values \(S0 = 1\) and \(S1 = 1\), which does not generate the correct Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. For example, for \(n = 3\), the code returns 17, whereas the correct Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is 29 (\(2^{2^3} + 1 = 29\)). Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
