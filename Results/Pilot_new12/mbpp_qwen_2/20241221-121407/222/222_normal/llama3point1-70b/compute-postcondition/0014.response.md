Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. It iterates through each character in the input string, checks if the character is uppercase, and if so, appends it to the `result` string. After the loop completes, it returns the `result` string. Potential edge cases include strings with no uppercase characters, which would result in an empty string being returned. The function does not modify the input string `s` and ensures that the returned string contains only the uppercase characters from the original string.**
