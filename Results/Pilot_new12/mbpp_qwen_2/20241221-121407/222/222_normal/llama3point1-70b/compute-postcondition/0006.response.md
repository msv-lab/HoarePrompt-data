`result` is assigned the value of `result` concatenated with `char`. The initial state of `result` depends on the initial state of `s`. If the first character of `s` is an uppercase letter, `result` is that character; otherwise, `result` is the first character of `s`.

After the code `result += char` is executed, `char` is added to the end of `result`.

Since the exact value of `char` is not specified, we can only say that `result` is now the concatenation of its initial value and `char`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string (excluding the character that was just processed), `result` is the concatenation of its initial value and `char`, `char` is the character just processed.**
