The code snippet `result += char` updates the `result` variable by concatenating the `char` to it if `char` is an uppercase letter. Otherwise, `result` remains unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string (excluding the last processed character)
- `result` is the concatenation of its initial value and `char` if `char` is an uppercase letter. Otherwise, `result` remains unchanged (still the first character of the original `s`).

After executing the code snippet, if `char` is an uppercase letter, `result` will be updated to include `char`. Otherwise, `result` will remain the same as the initial condition described.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a non-empty string (excluding the last processed character); `result` is the concatenation of its initial value and `char` if `char` is an uppercase letter. Otherwise, `result` remains unchanged (still the first character of the original `s`).**
