#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `result` is the concatenation of all uppercase characters from the original string `s`.
    return result
    #The program returns the concatenation of all uppercase characters from the original string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. It iterates through each character in the input string, checks if the character is uppercase, and if so, appends it to the `result` string. After the loop completes, it returns the `result` string. Potential edge cases include strings with no uppercase characters, which would result in an empty string being returned. The function does not modify the input string `s` and ensures that the returned string contains only the uppercase characters from the original string.
