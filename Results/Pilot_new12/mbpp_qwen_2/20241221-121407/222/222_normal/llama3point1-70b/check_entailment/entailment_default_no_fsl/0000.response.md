Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code removes lowercase substrings from a given string, but it actually removes lowercase characters instead of removing substrings. According to the problem description, the function should remove lowercase substrings, which means if a substring is entirely lowercase, it should be removed from the string. However, the current implementation only retains uppercase characters and ignores all other characters, including lowercase ones. This means the code does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected output should be an empty string because both "ello" and "orld" are lowercase substrings. However, the current code would return "HW" since it only keeps uppercase characters. Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement.
