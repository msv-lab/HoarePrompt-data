Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string and retains only the uppercase characters. The output hints also confirm this behavior, stating that the function iterates through each character in the input string, checks if the character is uppercase, and if so, appends it to the `result` string. The function does not modify the input string `s` and ensures that the returned string contains only the uppercase characters from the original string. There are no contradictions between the problem description, the code, and the output hints, hence the original assessment remains correct.
