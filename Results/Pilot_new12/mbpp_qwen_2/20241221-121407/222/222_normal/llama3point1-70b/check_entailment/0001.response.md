Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not handle lowercase substrings as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` only concatenates uppercase characters into the `result` string. Therefore, it does not remove lowercase substrings but instead removes all lowercase characters. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected output would be "HW", but the program will return "HWO". This means the program fails to meet the requirement of removing lowercase substrings entirely.
