Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through each character in the input string `s`, checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method, and appends it to the `result` string if it is. The function then returns the `result` string, which contains only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. The annotated version further confirms that the function operates as intended, iterating through the string and constructing a new string with only uppercase characters. There are no edge cases or scenarios provided where the function would fail based on the problem description and the given constraints.
