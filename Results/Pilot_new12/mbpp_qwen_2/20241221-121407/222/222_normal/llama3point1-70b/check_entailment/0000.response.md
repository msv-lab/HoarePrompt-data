Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string and retains only the uppercase characters. For any input string, the function iterates through each character and appends it to the result string only if it is uppercase. This logic ensures that all lowercase characters are excluded, which aligns with the problem description. Since there are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem statement, the function is correct.
