Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not meet the problem description. The problem description requires the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided program only keeps uppercase characters and discards lowercase ones. Therefore, the function does not remove lowercase substrings as required; instead, it filters out lowercase characters entirely. This means the function's behavior is different from what the problem description specifies.
