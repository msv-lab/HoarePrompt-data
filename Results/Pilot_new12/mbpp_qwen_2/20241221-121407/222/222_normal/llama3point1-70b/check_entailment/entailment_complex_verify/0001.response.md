Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the function should remove lowercase substrings from the given string, meaning it should retain only the uppercase characters and remove any sequences of lowercase characters. However, the annotated version of the code shows that the function `func_1` only concatenates uppercase characters into the `result` string, effectively removing all lowercase characters rather than lowercase substrings. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate as the function does not meet the requirement of removing lowercase substrings entirely; it merely retains uppercase characters.
