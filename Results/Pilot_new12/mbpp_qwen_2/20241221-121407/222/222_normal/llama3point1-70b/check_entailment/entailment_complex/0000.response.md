Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not meet the problem description because it removes lowercase substrings from the given string instead of removing all lowercase characters. The function correctly retains uppercase characters and discards lowercase ones, but the problem description specifically states that the function should remove lowercase substrings, not individual characters. A lowercase substring is a sequence of one or more consecutive lowercase characters, and the current implementation does not remove such sequences; it only retains uppercase characters.

To meet the problem description, the function should modify the string by removing all sequences of lowercase characters, leaving only the uppercase characters or sequences of uppercase characters.
