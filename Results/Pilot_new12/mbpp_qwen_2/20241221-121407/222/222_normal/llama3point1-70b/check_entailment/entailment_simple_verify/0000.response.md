Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` iterates through each character of the input string `s`, checks if the character is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and if true, appends it to the `result` string. This ensures that only uppercase characters are retained, effectively removing all lowercase substrings. The annotated version confirms that the function correctly processes the input string and constructs the expected output, which is the concatenation of all uppercase characters from the original string. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
