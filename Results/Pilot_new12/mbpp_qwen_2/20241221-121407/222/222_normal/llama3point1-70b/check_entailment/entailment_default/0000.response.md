Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through each character in the input string `s`, checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method, and if so, appends it to the `result` string. After the loop completes, it returns the `result` string, which contains only the uppercase characters from the original string. The function handles all potential cases correctly, including strings with no uppercase characters, which results in an empty string being returned. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the output hints that indicate the code is incorrect. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
