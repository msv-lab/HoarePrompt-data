Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The problem description requires the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, meaning that the entire substring consisting of lowercase characters should be removed, not just the individual lowercase characters. However, the provided code only concatenates uppercase characters into the result string, effectively removing all lowercase characters but not lowercase substrings. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string. Since the function does not meet the requirement of removing lowercase substrings entirely, the original assessment of incorrectness is justified.
