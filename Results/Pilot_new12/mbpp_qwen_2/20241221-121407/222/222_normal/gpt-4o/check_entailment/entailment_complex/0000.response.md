Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from `s`. This matches the requirement to "remove lowercase substrings" from the given string, effectively leaving only the uppercase characters.

The program processes each character in the string `s`, checks if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and includes it in the resulting string if the condition is met. The use of `char for char in s if char.isupper()` ensures that only uppercase characters are selected, and `return ''.join(...)` constructs the resulting string from these characters.

Given the examples provided:
- `func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'`
- `func_1('FInD') == 'FID'`
- `func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'`

All demonstrate that the function correctly removes lowercase characters and retains only the uppercase ones. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
