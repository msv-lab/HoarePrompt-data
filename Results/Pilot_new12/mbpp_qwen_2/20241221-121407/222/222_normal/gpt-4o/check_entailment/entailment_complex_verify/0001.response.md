Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. The annotated version further clarifies that the function processes each character in the input string `s`, checks if it is uppercase, and includes it in the resulting string. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description to remove lowercase substrings. The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected in the given scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
