Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters. The function works as expected for all the provided test cases:

- `func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'`: The lowercase character 'o' is removed, and the result is 'PYTH'.
- `func_1('FInD') == 'FID'`: The lowercase character 'i' is removed, and the result is 'FID'.
- `func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'`: The lowercase character 'i' and 'n' are removed, and the result is 'STRG'.

The function iterates through each character in the string `s`, checks if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and includes it in the resulting string. This approach ensures that only uppercase characters are included in the final string, meeting the problem description. Therefore, the function works correctly for all potential cases.
