Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string. Instead, it removes any lowercase characters. For example, consider the input `func_1('python')`. The expected output would be an empty string `''` because all characters are lowercase, but the program will return `'pyth'`, which includes the uppercase characters from the input. This contradicts the problem description, which specifies removing lowercase substrings rather than just individual lowercase characters. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
