Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the given output hints. The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string, as evidenced by the test cases provided in the problem description and the output hints. The function processes each character in the string, checks if it is uppercase, and if so, includes it in the resulting string. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to remove lowercase substrings. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
