Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the task is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the annotated version and the provided code do not actually achieve this. The function `func_1` returns a string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`, not the removal of lowercase substrings. For instance, for the input `'PYTHon'`, the expected output would be an error or an indication that lowercase substrings were removed, but the function returns `'PYTH'`, which includes the uppercase characters. Similarly, for `'STRinG'`, the expected output might be an error indicating the removal of lowercase substrings, but the function returns `'STRG'`. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate.
