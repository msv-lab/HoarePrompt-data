Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the problem description, the function should remove lowercase substrings from the given string. However, the provided code only removes lowercase characters individually, not substrings. For instance, `func_1('python')` should return an empty string `''` because the entire string is lowercase, but the code returns `'pyth'`, which includes the uppercase characters from the input. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function returns a string containing all uppercase characters from the original string, further supporting that the function is not meeting the problem description requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **False** is maintained.
