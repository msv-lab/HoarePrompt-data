Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided code does not meet this requirement. Instead, the code removes any lowercase characters individually, not considering them as substrings. For example, `func_1('python')` should return an empty string since all characters are lowercase, but the code returns `'pyth'`. The output hints confirm that the function only keeps uppercase characters, which further supports the original assessment. Therefore, the program is still incorrect based on the problem description.
