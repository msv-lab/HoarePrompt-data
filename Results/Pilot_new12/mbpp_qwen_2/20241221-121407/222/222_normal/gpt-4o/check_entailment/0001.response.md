Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string. It only keeps uppercase characters and ignores the lowercase ones. Given the problem description to remove lowercase substrings, the function works as intended in the provided test cases and there are no apparent edge cases that would cause it to fail. For example:
- `'PYTHon'` should result in `'PYTH'`.
- `'FInD'` should result in `'FID'`.
- `'STRinG'` should result in `'STRG'`.

Since the function handles the given examples correctly and there are no obvious edge cases that the current implementation fails to handle, the program is correct.
