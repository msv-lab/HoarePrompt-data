Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It removes all lowercase substrings (characters) from the given string and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters. The examples and the description of the code functionality match perfectly:

- For `func_1('PYTHon')`, the output is `'PYTH'` because 'o' is lowercase and removed.
- For `func_1('FInD')`, the output is `'FID'` because 'I' is uppercase and kept.
- For `func_1('STRinG')`, the output is `'STRG'` because 'i' and 'n' are lowercase and removed.

The code handles all the potential cases mentioned in the output hints, including strings with no uppercase characters and empty strings. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
