Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function iterates over each character in the input string `s`, checks if the character is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and joins the uppercase characters into a new string. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description of removing lowercase substrings. The test cases provided in the annotations also confirm that the function behaves as expected in those scenarios. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
