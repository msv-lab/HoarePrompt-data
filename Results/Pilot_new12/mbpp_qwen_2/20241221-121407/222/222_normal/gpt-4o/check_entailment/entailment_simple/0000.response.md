Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description, which states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the program removes all lowercase characters and keeps only the uppercase characters.

To correctly implement the problem description, the function should remove all lowercase letters from the string. However, the current implementation only keeps uppercase characters, effectively removing all lowercase characters. This results in a string that contains only uppercase characters, not removing the substrings as required.

For example, according to the problem description, `func_1('PYTHon')` should result in `'PYTHon'` with `'on'` removed, which would be `'PYTH'`. But the current function returns `'PYTH'` because it removes all lowercase characters.

Here's how the function should be corrected:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if not char.islower()])
```

This corrected version checks if each character is not lowercase (`if not char.islower()`) and includes it in the resulting string, thus removing all lowercase characters.
