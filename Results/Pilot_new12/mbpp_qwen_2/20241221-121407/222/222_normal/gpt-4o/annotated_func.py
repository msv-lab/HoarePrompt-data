#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
    #The program returns a string containing all uppercase characters from the original string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from `s`. If `s` contains no uppercase characters, it returns an empty string. If `s` is an empty string, it also returns an empty string. The function processes each character in `s`, checks if it is uppercase, and if so, includes it in the resulting string.
