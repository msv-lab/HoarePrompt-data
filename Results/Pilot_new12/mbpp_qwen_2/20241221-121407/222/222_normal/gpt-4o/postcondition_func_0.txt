The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from `s`. If `s` contains no uppercase characters, it returns an empty string. If `s` is an empty string, it also returns an empty string. The function processes each character in `s`, checks if it is uppercase, and if so, includes it in the resulting string.
