Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`, both of which are non-negative real numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). However, the given code does not correctly implement the formula for the volume of a cylinder; instead, it returns \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r \), where \( r \) is the radius. Therefore, the function will not provide the correct volume of a cylinder, and it will only return \( \frac{1}{3} \pi \times \text{radius} \). This means the function fails to account for the squared radius and the height in its calculation.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `radius` or `height` is zero, the returned value will still be \( \frac{1}{3} \pi \times \text{radius} \), which might be unexpected since the volume should be zero in such cases.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function should multiply the square of the radius (`radius ** 2`) by the height (`height`) and then by \( \frac{1}{3} \pi \) to correctly calculate the volume of a cylinder.
