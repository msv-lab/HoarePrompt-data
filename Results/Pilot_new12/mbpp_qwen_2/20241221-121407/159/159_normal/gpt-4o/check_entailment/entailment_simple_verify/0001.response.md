Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` takes non-negative real numbers as inputs (`radius` and `height`). The function correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The test cases provided using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance of 0.001 verify the correctness of the function for the given inputs. Since the function adheres to the problem description and the test cases confirm its accuracy, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
