Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function `func_1` takes two arguments, `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of the cone. The provided test cases assert that the function returns values that are close to the expected results within a relative tolerance of 0.001, which indicates that the function is correctly implementing the formula.

Given the problem description to write a function to find the volume of a cone, the provided code meets this requirement. The function handles the calculation correctly for the given inputs and the assertions confirm its accuracy. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case within the assumptions provided.
