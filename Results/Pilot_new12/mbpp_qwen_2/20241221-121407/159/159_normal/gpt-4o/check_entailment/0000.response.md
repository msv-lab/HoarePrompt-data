Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume. The given test cases assert that the function returns values close to the expected results within a relative tolerance of 0.001, which is consistent with the formula used. Since the function correctly implements the volume calculation and the provided test cases cover various inputs, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases described by the problem.
