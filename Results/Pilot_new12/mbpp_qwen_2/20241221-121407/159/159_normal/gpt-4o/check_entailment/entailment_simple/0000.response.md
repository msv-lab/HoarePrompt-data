Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone given the radius and height as inputs. The formula used in the function is \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), which correctly computes the volume of a cone. The test cases using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance confirm that the function returns the expected results for different sets of radius and height values. Since the function correctly implements the required formula and the provided test cases validate its correctness, the program meets the problem description.
