Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The code includes assertions that check the function against known values, which are calculated correctly. Given the problem description to find the volume of a cone, the function appears to be correctly implemented and tested for the provided cases. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case within the given problem description.
