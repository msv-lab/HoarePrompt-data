Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The test cases provided using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance of 0.001 confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs (5, 12), (10, 15), and (19, 17). Since the function adheres to the problem description and passes the provided test cases, it is reasonable to conclude that the function works correctly for these and potentially other cases as well. Without finding a counterexample or a specific case where the function fails, we can consider the function correct.
