Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative real numbers. The function correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone.

The problem description asks to write a function to find the volume of a cone. The function `func_1` meets this requirement by calculating the volume according to the formula specified. Additionally, the provided test cases using `math.isclose` with a relative tolerance confirm that the function produces results consistent with the expected values for given inputs. Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the test cases validate its correctness, the program is correct.
