#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative floating point numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height
    #The program returns 1/3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height, where radius and height are non-negative floating point numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative floating point numbers, and returns the volume of a cone. The formula used is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code correctly implements the intended functionality without any missing logic.
