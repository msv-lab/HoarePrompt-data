Functionality: **This function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative floating point numbers, and returns the volume of a cone. The formula used is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code correctly implements the intended functionality without any missing logic.**
