Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The annotations confirm that the inputs `radius` and `height` are non-negative floating-point numbers, which are appropriate for the calculation. The function returns the expected result based on these inputs. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
