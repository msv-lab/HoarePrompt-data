Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are non-negative floating point numbers, and returns the expected result. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or the output hints that suggest the function does not handle certain scenarios properly. Therefore, the function appears to meet the requirements for all potential valid inputs as described.
