Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume. There is no apparent missing logic or edge cases that this code is not handling. Since the function follows the problem description for the given input, and there are no apparent issues with the implementation, the program is correct.
