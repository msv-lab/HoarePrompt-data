Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. This formula is accurate and the program implements it without any issues. There are no apparent edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
