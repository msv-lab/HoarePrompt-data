Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are both non-negative floating point numbers. It returns the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height}\). The annotations clearly state that the function adheres to the specified problem description and there are no edge cases mentioned, implying that the function handles all valid inputs as required. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
