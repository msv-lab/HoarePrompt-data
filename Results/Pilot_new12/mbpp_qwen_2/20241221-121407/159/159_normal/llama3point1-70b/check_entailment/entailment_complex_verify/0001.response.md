Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where `radius` and `height` are non-negative floating-point numbers. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts these parameters and returns the expected volume. There are no apparent issues or missing logic in the implementation that would contradict the problem description or the original assessment.
