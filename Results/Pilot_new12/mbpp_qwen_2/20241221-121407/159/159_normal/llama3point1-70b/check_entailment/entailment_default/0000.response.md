Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the formula for finding the volume of a cone, which is \(\frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height}\). The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of the cone. Given the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to be correct for every potential case, assuming valid non-negative floating-point inputs for both `radius` and `height`. There are no edge cases or missing logic indicated in the hints, and the function accurately applies the mathematical formula provided in the problem description.
