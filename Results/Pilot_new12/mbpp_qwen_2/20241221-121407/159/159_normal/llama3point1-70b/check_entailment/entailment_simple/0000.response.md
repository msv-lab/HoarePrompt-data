Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are non-negative floating point numbers as stated in the problem description. The function returns the calculated volume, which matches the required functionality. Since the function correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone for any valid non-negative inputs, the program is correct according to the problem description.
