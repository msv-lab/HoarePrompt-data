Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` is intended to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. However, the annotated version and the original assessment incorrectly state that the function finds the "first occurrence" of the target element in reverse order. In fact, the function iterates through the array in reverse and returns the index of the first occurrence it encounters, which is the last occurrence in the original sorted order. 

The function should iterate through the array forward to find the last occurrence. The current implementation would only return the last occurrence if the target appears multiple times and is found towards the end of the array. For other cases, such as when the target appears only once or not at all, the function returns the index of the previous element (i.e., the second-to-last index), which is incorrect.

To fix this, the function should be modified to iterate through the array in the forward direction:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

With this correction, the function would correctly find the last position of the target element in the sorted array.
