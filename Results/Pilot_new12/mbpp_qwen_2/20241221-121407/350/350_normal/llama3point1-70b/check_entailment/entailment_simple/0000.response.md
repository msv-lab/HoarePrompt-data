Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(arr, target)` correctly implements the requirement to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Iterating from the end of the array**: The function iterates through the array `arr` starting from the last index (`len(arr) - 1`) down to the first index (`-1`). This ensures that the first match found will be the last occurrence of the `target` element in the array.

2. **Checking for target value**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the `target`. If a match is found, it immediately returns the index `i`.

3. **Returning -1 if not found**: If the loop completes without finding the target, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the target is not present in the array.

4. **Input validation**: The problem description states that we can assume the inputs will be valid, so no additional input validation is required in this function.

Given these points, the function always follows the problem description and performs as required.
