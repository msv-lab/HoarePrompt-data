Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. Instead, it searches the array in reverse order to find the first occurrence of the target element. This means that if the target element appears multiple times in the array, the function will return the index of the first occurrence rather than the last occurrence. 

To meet the problem description, the function should iterate through the array from the beginning to the end, checking for the target element, and return the index of the last occurrence. If the target is not found, it should return -1. The current implementation will not satisfy these requirements because it only checks in reverse order.
