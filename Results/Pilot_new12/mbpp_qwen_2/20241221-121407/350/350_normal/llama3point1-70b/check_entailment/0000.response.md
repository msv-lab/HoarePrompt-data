Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of the target element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array in reverse order, ensuring that it finds the last occurrence of the target. If the target is found, it returns its index; otherwise, it returns -1. This approach works for all potential cases, including edge cases like empty arrays or arrays without the target element. Since the function handles all described scenarios correctly, the correctness is **True**.
