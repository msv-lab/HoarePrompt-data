Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of the target element in a sorted array. However, based on the provided output hints, the function actually finds the first occurrence of the target element when iterating in reverse order. This is contrary to the problem description which asks for the last position of the target element. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate. The function should iterate forward to find the last occurrence of the target element, not backward.
