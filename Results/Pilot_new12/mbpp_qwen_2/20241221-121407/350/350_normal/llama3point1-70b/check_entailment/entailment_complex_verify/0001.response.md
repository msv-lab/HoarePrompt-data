Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. However, based on the annotated version of the code and the provided function, it appears that the function actually finds the first occurrence of the target element in reverse order. The function iterates from the end of the array towards the beginning and returns the index of the first match it finds, which is effectively the last occurrence of the target in a reversed array, not the last occurrence in the original sorted array. 

For example, consider the array `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and the target `2`. The function would return `1` (the index of the first `2` encountered from the end), which is the third occurrence of `2` if counted from the start. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description of finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. Hence, the original assessment is not accurate, and the final assessment is **False**.
