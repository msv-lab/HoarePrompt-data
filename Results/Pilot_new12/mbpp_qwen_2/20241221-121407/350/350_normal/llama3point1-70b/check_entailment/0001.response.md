Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates over the given sorted array `arr` in reverse order and returns the index of the last occurrence of the `target` element. If the target is not found, it returns `-1`. This approach ensures that the function will correctly identify the last position of the target element in the array. Since the array is sorted, this method works correctly for all potential cases without missing any edge scenarios.
