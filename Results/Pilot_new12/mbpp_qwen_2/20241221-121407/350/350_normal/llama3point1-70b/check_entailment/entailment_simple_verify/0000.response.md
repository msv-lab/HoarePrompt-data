Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of a target element in a sorted array. The annotated version of the code supports this by stating that the function iterates through the array in reverse order and returns the index of the first (and only) occurrence of the target if it exists, or `-1` if the target is not found. Given that the function adheres to the problem description and the annotations accurately reflect its behavior, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains valid.
