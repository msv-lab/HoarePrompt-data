Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. However, the provided output hints indicate that the function actually searches for the first occurrence of the target element in reverse order, not the last occurrence. Specifically, the output hint mentions that if `target` is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence, which is contrary to the problem description that requires finding the last position.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program should be assessed as incorrect.
