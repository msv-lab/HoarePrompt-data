Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` iterates over the given sorted array `arr` in reverse order and returns the index of the last occurrence of the `target` element. If the target is not found, it returns `-1`. This approach is consistent with the problem description, which requires finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. The annotations indicate that the function either returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` (which would be the last occurrence due to the reverse iteration) or `-1` if `target` is not found. Since the array is assumed to be valid and sorted, and the function handles all potential cases correctly, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
