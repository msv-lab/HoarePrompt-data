The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It iterates through the list in reverse order to find the first occurrence of `target`. If `target` is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence. If no exact match is found, it returns the second-to-last index of the list `arr`. If the list is empty or `target` is not found and the list has only one element, it returns `-1`.
