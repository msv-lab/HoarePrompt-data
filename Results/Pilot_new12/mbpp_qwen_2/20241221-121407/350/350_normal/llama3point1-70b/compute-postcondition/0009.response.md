Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, and the program returns the second-to-last index of the list `arr`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `target`, the function returns the second-to-last index of `arr`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `target`, the function returns the second-to-last index of `arr` as well.***
