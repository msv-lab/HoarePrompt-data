State before the loop starts: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target` is an integer.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop runs in reverse order from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`.
2. The loop condition checks if the current index `i` is within the bounds of the list, i.e., `0 <= i < len(arr)`.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the list `arr` has at least one element (i.e., `len(arr) > 0`). If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all because there would be no valid indices to iterate over.

Since the initial state does not explicitly state the length of `arr`, we need to ensure that `arr` is non-empty. Additionally, since the loop starts from `len(arr) - 1` and decrements, the starting index `len(arr) - 1` should be a valid index, meaning `arr` must have at least one element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, and `arr` must have at least one element.**
