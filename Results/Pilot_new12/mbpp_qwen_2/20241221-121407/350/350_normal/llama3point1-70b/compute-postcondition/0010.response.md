Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, and the function either returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` or returns `-1` if `target` is not found in `arr`.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order (from the last element to the first). It checks each element to see if it matches the `target`.
- **First Match**: When the loop finds an element in `arr` that matches `target`, it immediately returns the index of that element.
- **No Match**: If the loop completes without finding an element that matches `target`, it means `target` is not present in `arr`. Since the loop does not return within its body, it implicitly returns `-1` at the end of the function execution.
- **Final State**: After all iterations of the loop, the function will have returned either the index of the first occurrence of `target` or `-1` if `target` is not found in `arr`.

Thus, the final output state is that the function will return the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if it exists, or `-1` if `target` is not found in `arr`.
