Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It iterates through the list in reverse order to find the first occurrence of `target`. If `target` is found, it returns the index of the first occurrence. If no exact match is found, it returns the second-to-last index of the list `arr`. If the list is empty or `target` is not found and the list has only one element, it returns `-1`.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where `arr` is an empty list. In such a case, the function should return `-1`.
- The function correctly handles the case where `target` is not found and returns `-1` in this scenario, but it incorrectly states in the annotation that it returns the "second-to-last index" in some cases when no exact match is found. Instead, it should clearly return `-1` if `target` is not found and the list has only one element.
- The function does not handle the case where `target` is greater than all elements in the list (i.e., `target` is larger than the last element). In this case, the function should return `-1`.

Thus, the corrected functionality should cover all these edge cases and accurately reflect the actions performed by the code.
