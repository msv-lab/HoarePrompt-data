The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target`, which is an integer. The function returns an index based on certain conditions:

- Case_1: The function returns the index `i` where the current value of `arr[i]` is equal to `target`.
- Case_2: If such an element does not exist in `arr`, the function returns a value that does not match any element in `arr`.
- Case_3: The function returns the second-to-last index of the list `arr`.
- Case_4: The function returns `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`, and return the index of `target` if it exists, the second-to-last index of `arr` if no exact match is found, or `-1` in some cases.
