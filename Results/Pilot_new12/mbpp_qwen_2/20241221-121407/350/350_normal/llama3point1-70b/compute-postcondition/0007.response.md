According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order, starting from the last index and decrementing `i` by 1 each time. At the end of the previous iteration, `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target` is an integer such that no element in `arr` matches `target`. 

To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time:

1. The loop starts from `len(arr) - 1` and decrements `i` until it reaches -1.
2. Since `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order and no element matches `target`, the loop will continue to check each element in reverse order until it either finds a match or exhausts the list.

Given that the loop checks each element in reverse, the only way the loop would stop executing is if `i` reaches -1, meaning all elements have been checked and no match was found. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than -1.

Since the loop is currently checking the last element of the list (i.e., `i` is the last valid index), the next value of `i` would be the second-to-last index. However, because we know `arr` is sorted and no element matches `target`, the loop will continue to the next lower index.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be the second-to-last index, and `arr` remains the same as before.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, and the program returns an index that does not match any element in `arr` since no element in `arr` equals `target`, and `i` must be the second-to-last index of the list.**
