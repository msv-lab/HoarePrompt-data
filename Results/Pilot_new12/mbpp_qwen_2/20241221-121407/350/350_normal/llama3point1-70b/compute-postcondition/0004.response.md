According to the code, the loop iterates over the list `arr` from the last element to the first element (inclusive). The loop continues as long as `i` is within the bounds of the list.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` is an integer.
- For all elements in `arr`, the element is not equal to `target`.

Let's consider the state at the start of the current iteration:
- The loop starts with `i` being the index of the last element of `arr`.
- Since the loop decrements `i` by 1 each iteration, `i` is currently pointing to the second-to-last element of `arr`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to point to the last element of `arr`. Therefore, `i` should be decremented by 1 from its current value.

Given that `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and the condition that for all elements in `arr`, the element is not equal to `target`, these conditions remain unchanged.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `i` is now pointing to the last element of `arr`.
- The list `arr` remains a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` remains the same integer.
- For all elements in `arr`, the element is still not equal to `target`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, and for all elements in `arr`, the element is not equal to `target`.**
