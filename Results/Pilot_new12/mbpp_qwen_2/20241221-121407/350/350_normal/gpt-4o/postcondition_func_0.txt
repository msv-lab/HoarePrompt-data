The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. It searches for the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is found, it returns the index of the last occurrence. If `x` is not found, it returns `-1`. The function does this by iterating over the list in reverse order, checking each element against `x`. The final state of the program is that it returns either the index of the last occurrence of `x`, or `-1` if `x` is not found in `arr`.
