According to the code, the loop iterates from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0` in steps of `-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:

- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element.
- `i` is set to `len(arr) - 1`.
- `arr[i]` is not equal to `x`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than or equal to `0`. Since `i` was set to `len(arr) - 1` and the loop decreases `i` by `1` each iteration, `i` must now be `len(arr) - 2` or greater.

Given these conditions, we need to adjust the state accordingly:

- `arr` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is now `len(arr) - 2` because it was decreased by `1` from the previous value.
- The condition `arr[i] != x` still holds, so `arr[len(arr) - 2]` must not be equal to `x`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and `arr[i]` is not equal to `x`**
