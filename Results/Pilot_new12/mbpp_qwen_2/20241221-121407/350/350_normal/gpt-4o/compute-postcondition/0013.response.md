Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. It searches for the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is found, it returns the index of the last occurrence. If `x` is not found, it returns `-1`. The function does this by iterating over the list in reverse order, checking each element against `x`. The final state of the program is that it returns either the index of the last occurrence of `x`, or `-1` if `x` is not found in `arr`.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is found multiple times in `arr` and returns the index of the last occurrence.
- The function correctly handles the case where `x` is not found in `arr` and returns `-1`.
- The function correctly handles the case where `arr` is empty. In this case, the loop will not execute, and the function will return `-1`.

Since the code iterates through the list in reverse and checks for the last occurrence of `x`, it correctly identifies the last index of `x` if present. If `x` is not found, it correctly returns `-1`. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality in the provided code.
