Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is either -1 or the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`, and `i` is -1 if `x` is not found in `arr`.** 

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** The list `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and `x` is an integer.
- **Loop Execution:**
  - The loop starts from the last index of the list (`len(arr) - 1`) and decrements `i` until `i` becomes -1.
  - For each iteration, the loop checks if `arr[i]` is equal to `x`.
  - If `arr[i] == x`, the function returns `i` and stops executing further.
  - If `arr[i] != x`, the loop continues to decrement `i` by 1.

- **After Loop Completion:**
  - If the loop completes without finding `x` in the list, `i` will be set to -1.
  - If `x` is found in the list, the loop will return the index of the last occurrence of `x`, and `i` will no longer be used since the function has already returned.

Thus, the final state of `i` will be either the index of the last occurrence of `x` in `arr` or -1 if `x` is not found in `arr`. The list `arr` remains unchanged as per the problem statement.
