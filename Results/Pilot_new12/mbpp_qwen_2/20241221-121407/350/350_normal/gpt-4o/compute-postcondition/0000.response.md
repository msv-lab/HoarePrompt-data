According to the given code, the loop iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order. The loop starts from `len(arr) - 1` and goes down to `0`, decrementing by `1` each time.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the following:

1. **`arr` should not be empty**: If `arr` is empty, `len(arr) - 1` would be `-1`, and the loop would not start. Therefore, `arr` must have at least one element.
2. **The initial value of `i`**: The loop starts with `i` set to `len(arr) - 1`.
3. **The loop condition**: The loop continues as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`.

Given these points, let's adjust the state:

- `arr` must have at least one element to ensure the loop starts.
- `i` must be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least one element, `i` is set to `len(arr) - 1`**
