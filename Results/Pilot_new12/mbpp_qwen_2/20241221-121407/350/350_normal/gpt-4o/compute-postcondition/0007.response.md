Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element.
   - The loop starts from the end of the list (`len(arr) - 1`) and decrements `i` by 1 until `i` becomes 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

3. **Current State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 (since the loop decremented `i` from `len(arr) - 1` and continued until `i` reached 0).

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0.
   - However, since `i` is currently 0, the loop will not execute again unless `i` is set back to a value greater than 0 before the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `i` to be 1 (the second-to-last element of the list).
   - Additionally, since the loop will now decrement `i` again, `i` will become 0 at the start of the next iteration, but the condition will still allow the loop to run once more.

6. **Final State:**
   - `arr` remains the same (a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element).
   - `i` is adjusted to be 1 to allow the loop to execute one more time.
   - The condition `i >= 0` will still hold true when `i` is 1, ensuring the loop runs again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, `i` is 1**.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, `i` is 1**
