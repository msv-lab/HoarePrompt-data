Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function iterates over the array in reverse order, starting from the last element (index `len(arr) - 1`) down to the first element (index `0`). This ensures that the first match encountered is the last occurrence of `x` in the array.
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `x` is found in the array, the function returns the index of its last occurrence.
   - If `x` is not found in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`.

3. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test various scenarios, including arrays with multiple occurrences of `x`, single occurrences of `x`, and no occurrences of `x`. All these tests pass, confirming that the function behaves as expected in different cases.

4. **Input Validation**: The problem statement specifies that we assume valid input, so the function does not need to handle cases like non-list inputs or invalid data types. The provided code does not include such checks, but this aligns with the stated assumptions.

Given these points, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and performs as intended. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
