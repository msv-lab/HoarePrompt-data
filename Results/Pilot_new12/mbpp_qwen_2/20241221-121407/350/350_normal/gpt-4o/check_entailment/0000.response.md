Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program searches for the last position of an element in a sorted array using a linear scan from the end to the beginning. However, this approach does not guarantee correctness for all cases, especially when the array is not fully scanned. For example, consider the following input:

- Input: `arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4]`, `x = 3`

The expected output is `6` (the last position of `3`), but the program will return `-1` because it stops scanning as soon as it finds a match from the end, without ensuring that the last occurrence has been found. This can be demonstrated by adding another assertion:

```python
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4], 3) == 6
```

This shows that the program does not correctly handle cases where the target element appears multiple times and the last occurrence is not immediately after the first occurrence. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
