Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program does not guarantee finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. Specifically, the program performs a reverse linear search, which means it may stop returning early even if the last occurrence of the target element is not immediately after the first match. This behavior is evident from the example provided in the original assessment:

```python
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4], 3) == 6
```

The program would return `-1` in this case because it finds the first occurrence of `3` at index `5` and stops the search, not continuing to check the rest of the array. The annotated version supports this behavior by stating that the program may return `-1` if `x` is not found in `arr`, which is consistent with its current implementation. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
