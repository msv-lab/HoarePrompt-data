Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The provided output hints confirm that the function iterates through the list in reverse order to find the last occurrence of the target element, which aligns with the problem description. The test cases also validate the function's behavior across different scenarios, including arrays with a single occurrence, multiple occurrences, and middle occurrences of the target element. Since the function works as intended and meets the problem requirements, the original assessment of correctness being **True** remains valid.
