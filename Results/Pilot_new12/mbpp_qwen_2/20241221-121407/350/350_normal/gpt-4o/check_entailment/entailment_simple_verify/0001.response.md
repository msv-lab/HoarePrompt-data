Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, ensuring that it returns the last occurrence of the target element. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function behaves as expected based on the annotations. Specifically:

1. For the first test case, the function correctly returns 0, which is the index of the last occurrence of 1 in the array `[1, 2, 3]`.
2. For the second test case, the function correctly returns 2, which is the index of the last occurrence of 1 in the array `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`.
3. For the third test case, the function correctly returns 3, which is the index of the last occurrence of 3 in the array `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]`.

Given that the function logic aligns with the problem description and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. Therefore, the final assessment remains **True**.
