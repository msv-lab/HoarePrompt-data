Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function takes two parameters: `arr` (a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order) and `x` (an integer).
2. **Logic**: The function iterates over the list from the end to the beginning using a reverse loop (`for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`). It checks each element to see if it matches `x`. When it finds a match, it immediately returns the index `i`.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: If no match is found, the function returns `-1`, which indicates that the element `x` is not present in the array.
4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test different scenarios:
   - `[1, 2, 3]` with `x = 1` should return `0`.
   - `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` with `x = 1` should return `2`.
   - `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` with `x = 3` should return `3`.

Since the function meets all the criteria specified in the problem description and passes the given assertions, the program is correct.
