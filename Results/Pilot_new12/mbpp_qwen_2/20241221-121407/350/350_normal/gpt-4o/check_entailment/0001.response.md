Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, which ensures that it returns the last occurrence of the target element. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. A simple array with one occurrence of the target element.
2. An array with multiple occurrences of the target element.
3. An array with the target element appearing in the middle.

Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the logic ensures that the last occurrence is found, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
