You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 1) == 0
assert func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 2
assert func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3) == 3

def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, which ensures that it returns the last occurrence of the target element. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. A simple array with one occurrence of the target element.
2. An array with multiple occurrences of the target element.
3. An array with the target element appearing in the middle.

Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the logic ensures that the last occurrence is found, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `x`. It searches for the last occurrence of `x` in `arr`. If `x` is found, it returns the index of the last occurrence. If `x` is not found, it returns `-1`. The function does this by iterating over the list in reverse order, checking each element against `x`. The final state of the program is that it returns either the index of the last occurrence of `x`, or `-1` if `x` is not found in `arr`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
