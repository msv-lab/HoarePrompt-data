Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates over the array in reverse order, which ensures that the first match found will be the last occurrence of the target element. If the target element is found, the function returns its index; otherwise, it returns -1. The given test cases cover different scenarios, including arrays with multiple occurrences of the target element and single occurrences. Since the function behaves as expected in all provided cases and the problem description matches the implemented logic, the program is correct.
