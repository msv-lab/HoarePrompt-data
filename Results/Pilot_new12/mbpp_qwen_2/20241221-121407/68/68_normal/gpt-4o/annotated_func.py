#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are integers or floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It creates a complex number using these parameters and then returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number. This phase angle is the angle between the positive real axis and the vector representing the complex number in the complex plane. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need to be handled separately; however, it is important to note that the phase angle returned will always be in the range `(-π, π]`. If the complex number is zero (both `real` and `imag` are zero), the function will still correctly compute and return the phase angle, which is `0` radians.
