Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then creates a complex number using these values and returns the phase angle of this complex number in radians. 

The function uses the `cmath.phase()` method from the `cmath` module to calculate the phase angle, which is exactly what the problem description requires. The provided test cases use the `math.isclose()` function to verify that the returned value from `func_1` is close to the expected results within a relative tolerance of 0.001. These test cases confirm that the function correctly computes the phase angles for the given inputs.

Since the function implementation aligns with the problem description and the test cases validate its correctness, the program is correct.
