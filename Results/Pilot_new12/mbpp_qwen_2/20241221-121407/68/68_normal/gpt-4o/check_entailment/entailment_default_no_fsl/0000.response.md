Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, and computes the phase angle of the corresponding complex number using `cmath.phase()`. The assertions in the code verify the function against known values:

1. For the complex number `0 + 1j`, the phase angle is approximately `1.5708` radians (which is `π/2`).
2. For the complex number `2 + 1j`, the phase angle is approximately `0.4636` radians.
3. For the complex number `0 + 2j`, the phase angle is again approximately `1.5708` radians (which is `π/2`).

The code handles the general case correctly, and the output hints confirm that the function will return the phase angle in the range `(-π, π]`, which includes handling the case where both `real` and `imag` are zero (the result would be `0` radians). Since the provided assertions cover typical scenarios and the hints indicate that no additional edge cases are needed, the function appears to meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
