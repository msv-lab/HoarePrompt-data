Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. This matches the problem description.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: Inside the function, a complex number is created using the `complex(real, imag)` constructor. This ensures that the function can work with both integer and floating-point inputs, as stated in the problem description.

3. **Phase Calculation**: The function uses `cmath.phase(complex_number)` to calculate the phase angle of the complex number. The `cmath.phase()` function returns the phase angle (argument) of the complex number, which is the angle in radians from the positive real axis to the line segment that joins the origin with the point representing the complex number in the complex plane. This is exactly what the problem description requires.

4. **Output Range**: The phase angle returned by `cmath.phase()` is in the range `(-π, π]`. Since the problem description mentions this range and there are no specific edge cases mentioned that need to be handled separately, the function adheres to the expected output format.

5. **Edge Cases**: Even though no specific edge cases are mentioned, the function will correctly handle the case where both `real` and `imag` are zero, returning a phase angle of `0` radians. Additionally, it handles non-zero values appropriately, as demonstrated by the provided test cases.

Given these points, the function `func_1` consistently performs the required task as specified in the problem description, making the program correct.
