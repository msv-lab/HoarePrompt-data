You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are integers or floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It creates a complex number using these parameters and then returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number. This phase angle is the angle between the positive real axis and the vector representing the complex number in the complex plane. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need to be handled separately; however, it is important to note that the phase angle returned will always be in the range `(-π, π]`. If the complex number is zero (both `real` and `imag` are zero), the function will still correctly compute and return the phase angle, which is `0` radians.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
