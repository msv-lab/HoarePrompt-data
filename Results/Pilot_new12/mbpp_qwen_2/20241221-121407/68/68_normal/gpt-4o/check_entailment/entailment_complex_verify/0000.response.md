Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The annotations further clarify that the function accepts real and imaginary parts of a complex number and returns the phase angle in radians, which aligns with the problem description. The test cases provided in the assertions validate the correctness of the function for different inputs, confirming that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
