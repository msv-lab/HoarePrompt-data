Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The annotated version clarifies that the function takes real and imaginary parts as inputs and returns the phase angle of the corresponding complex number. The test cases provided in the assertions confirm the correctness of the function for the given inputs. Since the function uses a built-in Python library method (`cmath.phase`) for calculating the phase angle, and the provided test cases validate its correctness, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
