Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The test cases given in the assertions cover some specific points, such as when the real part is zero and when the imaginary part is positive. The `cmath.phase` function handles the general case of calculating the phase angle of any complex number, which includes all quadrants and edge cases like when the real part or imaginary part is zero. Since the function uses the built-in `cmath.phase` method, which is designed to handle these cases correctly, and the test cases provided do not reveal any issues, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
