Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The output hints confirm that the function accepts the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and returns the phase angle in radians, which is consistent with the problem description. The test cases provided in the assertions cover typical scenarios and edge cases, such as when the real part is zero and when the imaginary part is positive, ensuring that the function works correctly across different inputs. Since the `cmath.phase` function is designed to handle these cases, and the provided tests do not reveal any issues, the function is correct for all potential cases.
