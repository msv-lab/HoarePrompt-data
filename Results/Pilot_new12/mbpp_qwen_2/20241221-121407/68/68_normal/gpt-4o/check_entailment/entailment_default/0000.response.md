Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the function to get the angle of a complex number. The function `func_1` takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as inputs, creates a complex number using these values, and then returns its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function. The phase angle is correctly calculated for the given test cases:

- For the input `(0, 1j)`, the phase angle is approximately `1.5708` radians, which is equivalent to `90` degrees.
- For the input `(2, 1j)`, the phase angle is approximately `0.4636` radians.
- For the input `(0, 2j)`, the phase angle is again approximately `1.5708` radians.

The output hints confirm that the function returns the phase angle in radians, which is consistent with the behavior of the `cmath.phase` function. There are no specific edge cases mentioned that need to be handled separately, and the function works correctly for the provided examples and the general case of calculating the phase angle of a complex number.
