Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses the `cmath.phase` method to calculate the phase angle of a complex number, which is the correct approach. The provided test cases verify that the function returns the expected phase angles for the given inputs. The annotations confirm that the function accepts the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and returns the phase angle, covering the necessary functionality without any specific edge cases that need special handling beyond the standard behavior of `cmath.phase`. Since the function aligns with the problem description and the test cases validate its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
