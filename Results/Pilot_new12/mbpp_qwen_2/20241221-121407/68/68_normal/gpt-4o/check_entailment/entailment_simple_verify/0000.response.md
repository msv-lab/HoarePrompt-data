Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The test cases validate the function for different inputs, and the function handles the real and imaginary parts of the complex number appropriately. The annotations provide clarity on the state of the program and confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
