Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function from the `cmath` module. The test cases provided also validate the correctness of the function for different inputs. Since the function handles the real and imaginary parts of the complex number appropriately and uses the `cmath.phase` function which is designed to return the phase angle of a complex number, the function appears to meet the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
