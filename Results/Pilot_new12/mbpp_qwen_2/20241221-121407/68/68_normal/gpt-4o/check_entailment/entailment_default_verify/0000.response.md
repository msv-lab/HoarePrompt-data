Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase angle of a complex number, which aligns with the problem description of writing a function to get the angle of a complex number. The provided output hints further confirm that the function takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and returns the phase angle, which is within the expected range `(-π, π]`. Additionally, the test cases in the form of assertions validate the correctness of the function for different inputs, such as purely imaginary numbers and non-zero complex numbers. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
