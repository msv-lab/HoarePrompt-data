The code creates a complex number using the `complex()` function with the values of `real` and `imag`. After executing this line, the variable `complex_number` is assigned the complex value formed by these two inputs, while `real` and `imag` retain their original values.

Output State: **`real` is an integer or floating-point number, `imag` is an integer or floating-point number, `complex_number` is a complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`**
