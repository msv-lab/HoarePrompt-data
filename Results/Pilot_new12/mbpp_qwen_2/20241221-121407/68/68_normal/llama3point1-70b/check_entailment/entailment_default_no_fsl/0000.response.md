Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It then uses the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate and return the phase angle of the complex number. Given the problem description to write a function to get the angle of a complex number, the code accurately implements this functionality. The output hints confirm that the function handles all standard floating-point values for `real` and `imag`, and no specific edge cases beyond typical floating-point constraints are mentioned. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case as described.
