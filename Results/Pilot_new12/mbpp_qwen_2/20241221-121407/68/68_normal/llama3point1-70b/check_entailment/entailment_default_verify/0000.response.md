Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly uses the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the phase angle of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The output hints confirm that the function handles standard floating-point values and does not explicitly handle non-finite values like NaNs or infinities. However, since the problem description only requires the function to get the angle of a complex number, and the provided implementation meets this requirement without errors for valid inputs, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
