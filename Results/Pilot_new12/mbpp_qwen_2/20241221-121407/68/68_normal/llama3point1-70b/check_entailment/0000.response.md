Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly uses the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The function `cmath.phase(complex_num)` returns the phase angle of the complex number in radians, which satisfies the requirements of the problem description. Since the `cmath` module handles various edge cases such as zero values and negative numbers appropriately, and the provided function simply delegates the calculation to this reliable method, there are no known cases where this program would fail to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
