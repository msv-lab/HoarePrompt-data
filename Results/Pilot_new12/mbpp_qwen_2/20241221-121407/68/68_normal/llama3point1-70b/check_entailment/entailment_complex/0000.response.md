Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number using these parameters and then returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The problem description specifies that the function should get the angle of a complex number, and the provided implementation accurately performs this task. Since the input values are assumed to be valid, the function behaves as expected for all standard floating-point values without requiring additional handling for edge cases like NaNs or infinities, as no such specific cases were mentioned in the problem description.
