Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function. The output hints confirm that the function handles all standard floating-point values for the real and imaginary parts without any specific edge cases needing to be managed beyond typical floating-point arithmetic constraints. The function does not handle non-finite values like NaNs or infinities, but this is within the assumed valid input scenario. Given the problem description and the nature of the function, the code works correctly for every potential case within the valid input range.
