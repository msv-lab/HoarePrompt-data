Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and returns its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function. The output hints confirm that the function handles standard floating-point values for the real and imaginary parts without any specific edge cases that need to be addressed beyond typical floating-point arithmetic constraints. Given that the problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number and the provided code correctly implements this functionality, the original assessment is accurate. Therefore, the program is correct.
