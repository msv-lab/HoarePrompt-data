Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(real, imag)` takes two floating-point numbers, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It creates a complex number using these parts and then returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. This exactly matches the requirement of getting the angle of a complex number as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
