Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are expected to be the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function creates a complex number using these inputs and returns its phase (angle) using the `cmath.phase` function. The annotated code confirms that the function behaves as intended, returning the phase angle of the specified complex number. Since the function correctly implements the required functionality and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that it fails to handle under the assumption of valid input, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
