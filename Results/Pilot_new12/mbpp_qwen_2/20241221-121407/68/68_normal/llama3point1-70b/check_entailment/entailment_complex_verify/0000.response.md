Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts using the `cmath.phase()` function. The function handles standard floating-point values for the real and imaginary parts without any specific edge cases needing to be handled beyond typical floating-point arithmetic constraints. Since the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement and the annotated version supports this, the original assessment of correctness being True is maintained.
