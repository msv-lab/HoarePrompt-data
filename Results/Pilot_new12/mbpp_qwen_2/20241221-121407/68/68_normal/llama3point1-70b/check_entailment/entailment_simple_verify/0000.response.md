Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function constructs a complex number using these parameters and then returns the phase angle of this complex number using the `cmath.phase()` function. 

The annotated version clarifies that the state of the program before the function call involves `real` and `imag` being floating-point numbers. The function then constructs a complex number and returns its phase angle. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires a function to get the angle of a complex number.

Since the `cmath.phase()` function handles various edge cases appropriately and the provided function simply delegates the calculation to this reliable method, the program is correct according to the problem description and the annotations. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is appropriate.
