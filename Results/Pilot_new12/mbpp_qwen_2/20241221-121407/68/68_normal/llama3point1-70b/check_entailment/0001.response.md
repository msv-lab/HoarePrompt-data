Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then creates a complex number using these inputs and returns its phase (angle) using the `cmath.phase` function. According to the problem description, this approach correctly calculates the angle of a complex number for any valid real and imaginary values. Since the function correctly implements the required functionality without any apparent logical errors or edge cases that it fails to handle, it can be considered correct.
