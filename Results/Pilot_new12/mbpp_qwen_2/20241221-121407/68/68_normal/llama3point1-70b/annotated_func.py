#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part equal to `real` and imaginary part equal to `imag`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It creates a complex number using these inputs and then returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number. The function handles all standard floating-point values for `real` and `imag`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code that need to be handled beyond the typical constraints of floating-point arithmetic. The function does not handle non-finite values such as NaNs or infinities explicitly.
