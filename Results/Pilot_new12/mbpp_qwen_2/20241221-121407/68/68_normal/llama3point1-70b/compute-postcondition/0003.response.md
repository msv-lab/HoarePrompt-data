Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It creates a complex number using these inputs and then returns the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number. The function handles all standard floating-point values for `real` and `imag`. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the code that need to be handled beyond the typical constraints of floating-point arithmetic. The function does not handle non-finite values such as NaNs or infinities explicitly.**
