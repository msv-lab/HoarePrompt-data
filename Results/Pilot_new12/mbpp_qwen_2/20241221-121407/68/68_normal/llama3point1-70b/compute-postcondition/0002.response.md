The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with the real part equal to `real` and the imaginary part equal to `imag`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers `real` and `imag`, and return the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number formed by these real and imaginary parts.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers. It returns the phase angle (in radians) of the complex number with real part equal to `real` and imaginary part equal to `imag`.**
