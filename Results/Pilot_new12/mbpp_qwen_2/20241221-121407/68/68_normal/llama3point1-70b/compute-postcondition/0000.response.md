The code creates a complex number using the `complex(real, imag)` function, which takes the real and imaginary parts as arguments and returns a complex number. The real and imag variables are used as arguments to create this complex number. After the creation, the `real` and `imag` variables still hold their original values, but now there is a new variable `complex_num` that represents the complex number formed by these values.

Output State: **`real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, `complex_num` is a complex number with real part equal to `real` and imaginary part equal to `imag`.**
