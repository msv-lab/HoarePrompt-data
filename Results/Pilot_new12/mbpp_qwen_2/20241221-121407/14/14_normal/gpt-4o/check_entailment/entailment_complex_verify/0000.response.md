Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether an array contains any duplicate elements by using a set to track seen numbers. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for arrays with and without duplicates. The annotated version further clarifies the program's behavior, indicating that the function iterates through the array, adding each number to a set and checking for duplicates, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given criteria.
