Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check for duplicates in an array of integers. The function uses a set to keep track of seen numbers, returning `True` as soon as a duplicate is found, and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including arrays with no duplicates and arrays with multiple duplicates, ensuring that the function behaves as expected. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at different points, aligning with the function's intended behavior. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
