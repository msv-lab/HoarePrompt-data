Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set to keep track of elements that have been seen so far. If a duplicate element is found, it immediately returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after iterating through the entire array, it returns `False`. This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies whether any duplicate elements exist in the array for any given input.

The examples provided also confirm that the function works as expected:
- For an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` with no duplicates, it correctly returns `False`.
- For an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]` with a duplicate `4`, it correctly returns `True`.
- For an array `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]` with multiple duplicates, it correctly returns `True`.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and the logic seems sound for identifying duplicates, the program is correct.
