Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to detect duplicates in an array of integers using a set to track seen elements. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, covering various scenarios such as arrays with and without duplicates, and even an empty list (though not explicitly mentioned in the hints, it is implied by the nature of the algorithm). The function's logic is sound, and the provided test cases confirm its correctness. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
