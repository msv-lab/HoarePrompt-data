Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses a set to keep track of seen numbers and returns `True` as soon as a duplicate is found. The function handles various cases, including arrays with no duplicates, arrays with duplicates, and edge cases like an empty array (which would never return `True` since no numbers are checked). All assertions provided in the output hints also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases.
