Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to detect duplicates in an array of integers. The function uses a set to track seen numbers and returns `True` as soon as a duplicate is found. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, it returns `False`. The output hints confirm that the function covers all relevant cases, including edge cases like an empty list. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness for various scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
