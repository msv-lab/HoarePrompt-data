Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the presence of duplicate elements in an array of integers. The annotations clearly show that the function initializes an empty set `seen` and iterates through each number in the input array `arr`. If a number is already in the set, it returns `True`, indicating a duplicate. If no duplicates are found, it returns `False`. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including arrays with no duplicates and arrays with multiple duplicates, and the function behaves as expected in all cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
