Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set to keep track of seen numbers. If a number is encountered that is already in the set, it immediately returns `True`, indicating a duplicate has been found. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, it returns `False`. This logic correctly identifies the presence of duplicates for any given array of integers. The provided test cases also cover various scenarios, including arrays with no duplicates and arrays with multiple duplicates. Since the function works correctly for these cases and the logic handles the problem description accurately, the program is correct.
