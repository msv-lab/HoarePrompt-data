Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and checks for the presence of any duplicate elements within the list. It uses a set called `seen` to keep track of the integers it encounters during iteration over the list. If a duplicate integer is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, the function returns `False`.

The program correctly handles all cases mentioned in the problem description and additional edge cases:
1. It correctly returns `False` for an array with no duplicates (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).
2. It correctly returns `True` for an array with at least one duplicate (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]` or `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`).

The program also assumes valid input as stated, meaning the input list will always contain integers, and it will not encounter errors due to invalid input types like strings or non-integer values. Given these assumptions, the program adheres to the problem description and always performs the required task correctly.
