Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to detect duplicates in an array of integers. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to check if there are any duplicate elements in the given list `arr`.

2. **Algorithm Used**: 
   - A set named `seen` is initialized to keep track of elements that have been encountered.
   - For each element `num` in the list `arr`, the program checks if `num` is already in the `seen` set.
     - If `num` is in `seen`, it means a duplicate has been found, and the function immediately returns `True`.
     - If `num` is not in `seen`, it is added to the set.
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`.

3. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `False` because there are no duplicates.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])` returns `True` because the number `4` appears twice.
   - `func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5])` returns `True` because there are multiple pairs of duplicates (e.g., `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the general case of detecting duplicates efficiently.
   - It assumes the input is a valid list of integers, which aligns with the assumption provided in the instructions.

Since the program correctly identifies the presence of duplicates and returns the appropriate boolean values for the given test cases, it meets the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
