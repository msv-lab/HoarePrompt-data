The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. Since `num` is not already in `seen` (as per the initial state), it will be added to the set. The output state will reflect this addition and indicate that the function does not return anything (implying it returns `None`).

Output State: **`arr` contains at least one integer that is not in `seen`; `seen` now includes the value of `num`; the function returns `None`**
