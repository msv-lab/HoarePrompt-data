Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `arr` must contain at least one integer.
   - `seen` is a set containing `num`.
   - `num` is not in `seen`.

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in `arr`.

3. **Current Iteration End Conditions:**
   - Since `num` is already in `seen`, it means we have seen this number before during some previous iteration.
   - This implies that the current value of `num` is not new and thus does not satisfy the condition `num` is not in `seen`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to continue, the next value of `num` should be an element from `arr` that is not yet in `seen`.

5. **Modifying States for Next Iteration:**
   - `arr` must still contain at least one integer.
   - `seen` will now include the current `num` since it was processed in the previous iteration.
   - `num` for the next iteration must be an element from `arr` that is not in `seen`.

6. **Formulating the New State:**
   - `arr` must contain at least one integer.
   - `seen` must include the current `num`.
   - `num` for the next iteration must be an integer from `arr` that is not in `seen`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`arr` must contain at least one integer, `seen` includes the current `num`, `num` for the next iteration must be an integer from `arr` that is not in `seen`**
