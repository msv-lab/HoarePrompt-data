`num` is added to the set `seen`. The set `seen` was initially empty, so now it contains `num`. The value of `arr` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` must contain at least one integer, `seen` is a set containing `num`, `num` is not in `seen` (since it has been added to `seen`).

Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one integer, `seen` is a set containing `num`, `num` is not in `seen`**
