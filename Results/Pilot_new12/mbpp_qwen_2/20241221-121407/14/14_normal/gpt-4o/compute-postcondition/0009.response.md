The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. This operation modifies the set `seen` by including the current value of `num`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` must contain at least one integer, `seen` now includes the current `num`, and `num` for the next iteration must be an integer from `arr` that is not in `seen`.**
