Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks for the presence of any duplicate integers within the list. It maintains a set called `seen` to track the integers it encounters. If a duplicate integer is found, the function returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after iterating through the entire list, the function returns `False`. The function covers all edge cases, including an empty list where no duplicates can exist, and a list with only unique elements.**

This summary reflects the actual behavior of the function based on the code provided and includes the essential aspects such as handling an empty list and ensuring that no duplicates are missed.
