Postcondition: ***`arr` contains at least one integer that is not in `seen`. After the execution of the if-else block, if `num` is found in `seen`, the function returns True. If `num` is not found in `seen`, `num` will be added to `seen`, and the function does not return anything (implying it returns None).***
