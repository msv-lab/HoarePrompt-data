Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `arr` must contain at least one integer.
   - `seen` now includes the current `num`.
   - `num` for the next iteration must be an integer from `arr` that is not in `seen`.

2. **Loop Behavior:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in `arr`.
   - `num` is added to `seen` at the end of each iteration.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` still contains at least one integer (since we are still iterating).
   - `seen` now includes the current `num` (let's call this `current_num`).
   - For the next iteration, `num` must be an integer from `arr` that is not in `seen`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are integers in `arr` that are not in `seen`.
   - Therefore, for the next iteration, `num` should be an integer from `arr` but not in `seen`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `arr` must still contain at least one integer that is not in `seen` (since we are about to check the next `num`).
   - `seen` now includes `current_num`.
   - `num` for the next iteration must be an integer from `arr` that is not in `seen`.

So, the updated states are:
- `arr` must contain at least one integer that is not in `seen`.
- `seen` now includes `current_num`.
- `num` for the next iteration must be an integer from `arr` that is not in `seen`.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`arr` must contain at least one integer that is not in `seen`, `seen` now includes the current `num`, and `num` for the next iteration must be an integer from `arr` that is not in `seen`.**
