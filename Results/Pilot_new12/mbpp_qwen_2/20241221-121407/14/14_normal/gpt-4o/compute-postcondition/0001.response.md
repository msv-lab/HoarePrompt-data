Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

Given:
- `arr` is a list of integers.
- `seen` is an empty set.

The for loop is:
```
for num in arr:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop will only execute if there are elements in `arr` to iterate over. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute even once.

2. **First Iteration**: For the first iteration of the loop, `num` will take the value of the first element in `arr`. Since `arr` is a list, the first element will be accessible and valid.

3. **Subsequent Iterations**: Each subsequent iteration will assign the next element in `arr` to `num` until all elements in `arr` have been processed.

4. **Initial State**: Given that `arr` is a list of integers and `seen` is an empty set, we need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element for the loop to execute.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `arr` must contain at least one integer.

State: **`arr` must contain at least one integer, `seen` is an empty set**
