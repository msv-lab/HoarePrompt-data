The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks for the presence of any duplicate integers within the list. It maintains a set called `seen` to track the integers it encounters. If a duplicate integer is found, the function returns `True`. If no duplicates are found after iterating through the entire list, the function returns `False`. The function covers all edge cases, including an empty list where no duplicates can exist, and a list with only unique elements.
