Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` as a parameter and returns `True` if the number of unique elements in `arr` is less than the total number of elements in `arr`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This means that if there are duplicate elements in `arr`, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`. The function checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the list with the length of a set created from the list. If the lengths differ, it indicates the presence of duplicates. An empty list or a list with all unique elements will result in `False`, while any list with at least one duplicate will result in `True`.**
