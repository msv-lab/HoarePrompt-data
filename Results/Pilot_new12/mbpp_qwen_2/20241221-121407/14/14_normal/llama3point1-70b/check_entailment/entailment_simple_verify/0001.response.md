Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` checks for the presence of duplicates by comparing the length of the array with the length of the set of the array. While this method works for many cases, it fails when the array contains duplicate elements but the number of unique elements is the same as the total number of elements in the array. 

For example:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 1]`
- Expected output: `True` (since there is a duplicate)
- Actual output: `False` (the function returns `False` because the lengths of the array and the set are the same)

The original assessment correctly identifies this issue. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `False` when the lengths are equal, which happens when there are duplicates but they do not increase the count of unique elements. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
