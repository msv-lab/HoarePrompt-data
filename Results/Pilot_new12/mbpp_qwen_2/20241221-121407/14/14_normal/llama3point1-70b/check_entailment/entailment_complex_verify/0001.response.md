Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the input list with the length of a set created from the list. While this method works for most cases, it fails when the list contains multiple occurrences of the same element. Specifically, if the list has at least one duplicate, the lengths of the list and the set will be the same, leading to a false negative. For example, for the input `[1, 2, 3, 1]`, the function returns `False` instead of `True`. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description for every potential case, which is why the original assessment of **False** is correct.
