Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The annotated version of the code further clarifies that the function returns `True` if the length of the list `arr` is not equal to the length of the set of `arr`, indicating the presence of duplicates. Conversely, it returns `False` if the lengths are equal, indicating no duplicates. Given that the provided solution accurately leverages the property of sets to identify duplicates and works for all valid inputs (as per the assumption), the original assessment is accurate.
