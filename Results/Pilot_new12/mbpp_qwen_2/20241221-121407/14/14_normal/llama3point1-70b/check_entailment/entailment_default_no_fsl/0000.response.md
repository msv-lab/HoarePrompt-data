Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given array contains any duplicate elements by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set created from the array. If the lengths differ, it indicates the presence of duplicates, which is the correct logic for detecting duplicates. The function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, including edge cases like an empty list or a list with all unique elements. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case within the given assumptions.
