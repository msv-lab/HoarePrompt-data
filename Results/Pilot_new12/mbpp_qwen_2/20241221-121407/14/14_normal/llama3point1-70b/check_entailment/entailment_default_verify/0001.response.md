Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` fails to correctly identify duplicates in arrays with more than one occurrence of the same element. As per the output hints, the function checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the list with the length of a set created from the list. If the lengths differ, it indicates the presence of duplicates. However, this approach is flawed because an array with multiple identical elements will still return `False` since the lengths of the array and the set will be the same. For example, the input `[1, 2, 3, 1]` should return `True`, but the function returns `False`. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description for every potential case, and the original assessment remains correct.
