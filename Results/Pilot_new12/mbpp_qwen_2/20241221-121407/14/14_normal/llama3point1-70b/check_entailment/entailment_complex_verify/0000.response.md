Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the presence of duplicate elements in the given array of integers. The annotated version clearly explains that the function returns `True` if the number of unique elements in `arr` is less than the total number of elements in `arr`, which is true if and only if there are duplicates. The function works for all potential cases, including an empty list or a list with all unique elements, which results in `False`. Therefore, the function meets the problem description accurately.
