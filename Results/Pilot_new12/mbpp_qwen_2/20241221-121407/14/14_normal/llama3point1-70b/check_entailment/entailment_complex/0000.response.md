Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns `True` if there are any duplicate elements in the list, and `False` otherwise. This is achieved by comparing the length of the list with the length of a set created from the list. Since sets automatically remove duplicate elements, if the lengths differ, it indicates the presence of duplicates in the original list. 

- When there are no duplicates (all elements are unique), the length of the list and the set will be the same, resulting in `False`.
- When there are duplicates, the length of the list will be greater than the length of the set, resulting in `True`.

This logic correctly identifies the presence of duplicates according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
