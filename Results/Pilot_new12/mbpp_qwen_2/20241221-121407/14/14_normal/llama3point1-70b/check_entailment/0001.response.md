Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the length of the array is different from the length of the set of the array. This approach will correctly identify duplicates for most cases, but it fails in certain scenarios. For example, consider an array with only one element:

- Input: `[5]`
- Expected output: `False` (since there are no duplicates)
- Actual output: `False` (the function works correctly in this case)

However, consider an array with multiple identical elements:

- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 1]`
- Expected output: `True` (since there is a duplicate)
- Actual output: `False` (the function returns `False` because the lengths of the array and the set are the same, even though there is a duplicate)

Since the function fails to identify duplicates in arrays with more than one occurrence of the same element, it does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
