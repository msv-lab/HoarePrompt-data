Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the property that converting a list to a set removes duplicates. If the length of the original list is different from the length of the set, it means there were duplicates in the original list. This approach works for all potential cases where an array might contain duplicate elements or not. Since the function correctly identifies the presence of duplicates for any given array of integers, it meets the problem description in every case.
