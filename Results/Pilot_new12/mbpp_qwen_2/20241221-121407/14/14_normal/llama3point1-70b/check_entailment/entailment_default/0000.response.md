Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks for duplicates in an array by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set created from the array. If the lengths differ, it indicates the presence of duplicates. This approach works correctly for all potential cases. An empty list or a list with all unique elements will result in `False`, while any list with at least one duplicate will result in `True`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` if there are duplicates and `False` otherwise. There are no potential cases where the program does not work as intended based on the given problem description and output hints.
