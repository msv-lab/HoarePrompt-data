Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the original list with the length of a set created from the list. If the lengths differ, it indicates the presence of duplicates. This logic accurately identifies whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. The output hints also support this, stating that the function returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program is correct based on the provided problem description and output hints.
