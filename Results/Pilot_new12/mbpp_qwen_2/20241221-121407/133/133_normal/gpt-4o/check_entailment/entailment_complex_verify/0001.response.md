Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple. The annotated version accurately describes the state of the program and the operations being performed. The function handles tuples of the same length as required, and the provided test cases confirm its correctness. While the function does not explicitly check for tuple lengths, the problem description assumes valid inputs, and the annotated version clarifies this assumption. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
