Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the subtraction of elements from two tuples with the same indices. The function uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor and the `zip` function to ensure that corresponding elements are subtracted. The test cases given in the output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected under various scenarios, including tuples of different lengths, although the behavior for unequal lengths is undefined. However, the problem description does not specify handling cases where tuples have different lengths, only that they should subtract corresponding elements. Therefore, the function correctly meets the problem description as long as the tuples are of the same length, which is implicitly assumed by the test cases and the problem context.
