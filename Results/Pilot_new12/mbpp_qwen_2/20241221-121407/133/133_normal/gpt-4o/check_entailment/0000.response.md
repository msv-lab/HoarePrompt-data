Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over corresponding elements of both tuples and applies the subtraction operation. The results are then converted into a tuple using a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor. 

All the provided test cases also validate the functionality of the function. Since the function works correctly for the given examples and there is no apparent logical flaw or edge case that the function does not handle, the function meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
