Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. The annotated version of the code provides clear insights into the operations performed by the function, confirming that it returns a new tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of the input tuples. The test cases provided also validate the functionality of the function for the given examples. While the annotated version mentions that the function assumes both tuples are of equal length and does not explicitly handle cases where tuples have different lengths, the problem description does not specify such edge cases as part of the requirement. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
