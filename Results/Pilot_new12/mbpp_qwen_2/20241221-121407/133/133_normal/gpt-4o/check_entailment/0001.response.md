Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the subtraction of elements from two tuples with the same indices using a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor. The function uses `zip` to iterate over corresponding elements of both tuples and performs the subtraction. The provided test cases cover various scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected. Given the implementation and the test cases, the function appears to handle all potential cases correctly.
