Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code and the provided test cases clearly demonstrate that the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over corresponding elements of both tuples and applies the subtraction operation. The results are then converted into a tuple using a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor. All the provided test cases validate the functionality of the function, and there is no apparent logical flaw or edge case that the function does not handle. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
