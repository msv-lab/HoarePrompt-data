Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to subtract the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple element-wise. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over corresponding elements of both tuples and applies the subtraction operation. The results are then converted into a tuple using a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of the same length and returns a new tuple with the differences. Although the output hints mention that the function will return an empty tuple if either tuple is empty, this behavior is consistent with the problem description, which does not specify how to handle tuples of different lengths. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
