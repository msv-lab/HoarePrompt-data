Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of `tup2` from `tup1`. The code uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples, which ensures that the subtraction is performed element-wise. The examples provided in the output hints and the assertions in the code cover various scenarios, including tuples of different sizes, and the code handles them appropriately by using `zip`, which stops when the shortest tuple is exhausted. Since the code meets the requirements for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
