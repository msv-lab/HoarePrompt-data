Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements of the second tuple from the first tuple. The code uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` function to compute these differences, and `zip()` ensures that corresponding elements from both tuples are paired together.

The examples provided in the problem description match the behavior of the function:
- `func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18))` results in `(8, -1, -13)`
- `func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16))` results in `(-13, -43, -13)`
- `func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12))` results in `(-3, 7, -3)`

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, performing element-wise subtraction between the two tuples. Since the code handles tuples of equal length correctly and there are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
