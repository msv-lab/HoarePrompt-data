Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`) as input, subtracts the corresponding elements of these tuples, and returns a new tuple containing the results. The use of `zip(tup1, tup2)` ensures that elements at the same indices are paired together, and the generator expression `(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))` calculates the differences. The function then converts this generator into a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor. 

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function handles tuples of the same length as required. Since the assumption is that the input tuples are of equal length and contain numerical values, the function works as expected without any additional error handling needed for invalid inputs. Thus, the program always does what the problem description asks for.
