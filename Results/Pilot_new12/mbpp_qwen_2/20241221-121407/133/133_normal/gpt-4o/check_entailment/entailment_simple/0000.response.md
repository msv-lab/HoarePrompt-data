Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two tuples as input, ensures they are of the same length, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding elements from the second tuple from the first tuple. The provided assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since the function correctly performs the subtraction operation for all tested cases and no invalid inputs are handled separately (as per the problem statement assumptions), the program is correct according to the problem description.
