Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the subtraction of elements from two tuples with the same indices. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates over corresponding elements of both tuples and returns a new tuple with the differences. The test cases given in the annotations cover various scenarios and validate the function's behavior. Since the input is assumed to be valid and the function handles all tested cases correctly, the program's correctness is confirmed.
