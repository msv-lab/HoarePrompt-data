The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `tup1` and `tup2`, both tuples of the same length containing numerical values. It returns a new tuple where each element is the difference between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. This means that for each pair of elements (a, b) from `tup1` and `tup2` respectively, the function computes `a - b` and includes the result in the returned tuple. If either `tup1` or `tup2` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. There are no explicit checks for the length of the tuples, so it is assumed that both tuples are of equal length. If the tuples have different lengths, the behavior is undefined as the code relies on `zip` which will stop when the shortest tuple is exhausted.
