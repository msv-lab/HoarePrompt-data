The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are tuples of the same length containing numerical values. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction operation element-wise. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is assumed that both input tuples are of the same length. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the `zip` function, as it requires inputs of the same length.
