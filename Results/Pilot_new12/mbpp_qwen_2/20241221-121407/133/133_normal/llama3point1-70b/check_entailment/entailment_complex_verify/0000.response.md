Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the subtraction of corresponding elements from two tuples of the same length. The use of `zip` ensures that the operation is performed element-wise, and the function returns a new tuple with the results. The annotated version confirms that the function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction operation as required. While the annotated version mentions that the function will raise a `ValueError` if the tuples are of different lengths, this is an expected behavior given the nature of the `zip` function and the problem description does not require handling such cases. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is justified.
