Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the subtraction of corresponding elements from two tuples. It uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples and applies the subtraction operation. This approach ensures that the function works for any tuples of equal length. Since the function does not introduce any bugs or logical errors, and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, the correctness of the program is **True**.
