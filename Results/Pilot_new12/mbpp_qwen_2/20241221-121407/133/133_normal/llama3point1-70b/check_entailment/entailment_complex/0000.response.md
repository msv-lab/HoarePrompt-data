Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as input, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. This is achieved using a generator expression within the `tuple()` function, which iterates over pairs of elements from `tup1` and `tup2` using `zip()`. Since the problem description specifies that the tuples should be of the same length, the use of `zip()` ensures that the function will only operate on pairs of elements if the tuples are indeed of equal length. Therefore, the function always meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs.
