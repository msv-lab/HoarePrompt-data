Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. It takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, both of which are assumed to be of the same length and contain numerical values. The function uses the `zip` function to pair elements from both tuples at the same index and then subtracts the corresponding elements (`b` from `a`) to form a new tuple. Finally, it returns this new tuple. 

Given these operations, the function ensures that for every pair of elements `(a, b)` from `tup1` and `tup2` respectively, the result is `a - b`. Therefore, the function satisfies the problem description in all cases.
