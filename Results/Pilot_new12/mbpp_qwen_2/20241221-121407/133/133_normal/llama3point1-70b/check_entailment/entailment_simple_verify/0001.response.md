Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the corresponding elements of the second tuple from the first tuple. The annotations confirm that `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numerical values, which is a valid assumption given the problem description. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple()` constructor to create a new tuple with the results of the subtraction, which aligns perfectly with the problem requirements. Therefore, based on the annotations and the problem description, the function is correct.
