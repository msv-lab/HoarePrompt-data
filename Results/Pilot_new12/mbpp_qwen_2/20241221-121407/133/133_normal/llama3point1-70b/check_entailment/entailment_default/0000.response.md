Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the elements of the second tuple from the first tuple with the same index. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction operation element-wise. Given that both tuples are of the same length (as required by the `zip` function), the function will work correctly for every potential case where the input tuples meet this requirement. The function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction operation element-wise, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. There are no edge cases mentioned in the output hints that suggest the function behaves incorrectly, and the function does not need to handle cases where the tuples are of different lengths because the problem description and the function itself ensure that both tuples are of the same length. Therefore, the function is correct for every potential case.
