Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clarifies that `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length containing numerical values. The function `func_1` correctly implements the subtraction of corresponding elements from these tuples using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor. This approach ensures that the function returns a new tuple with the results of the subtractions, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The annotated version supports the correctness of the program by confirming that the function behaves as intended under the given assumptions.
