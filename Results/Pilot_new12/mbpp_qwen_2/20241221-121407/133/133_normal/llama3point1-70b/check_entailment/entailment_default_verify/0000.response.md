Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` implements the subtraction of corresponding elements from two tuples. The provided code uses the `zip` function to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples and applies the subtraction operation. The output hints confirm that the function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction operation element-wise. While the output hints mention that the function will raise a `ValueError` if the tuples are of different lengths, this is expected behavior and aligns with the problem description, which does not specify handling tuples of unequal lengths. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
