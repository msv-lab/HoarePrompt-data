Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. This matches the problem description exactly. Since the function uses `zip` to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples and applies subtraction to each pair, it will work correctly as long as both input tuples are of the same length. There are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the problem description that this function does not handle. Therefore, the function is correct for every potential case described.
