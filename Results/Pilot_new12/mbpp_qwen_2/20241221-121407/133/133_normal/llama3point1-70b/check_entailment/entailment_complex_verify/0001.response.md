Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. This matches the problem description exactly. The annotated version confirms that the function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction operation element-wise. While the annotated version mentions that if the tuples are of different lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the `zip` function, this is a valid behavior and does not indicate a logical error in the function itself. Therefore, the function is correct for every potential case described in the problem.
