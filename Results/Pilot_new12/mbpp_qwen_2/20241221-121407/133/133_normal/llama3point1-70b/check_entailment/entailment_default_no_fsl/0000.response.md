Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by taking two tuples of the same length and returning a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction operation element-wise. Since the function raises a `ValueError` when the tuples are of different lengths, it ensures that only tuples of the same length are processed, which aligns with the problem description. Given the constraints and the examples implied by the problem description and output hints, the function behaves as expected for every potential case.
