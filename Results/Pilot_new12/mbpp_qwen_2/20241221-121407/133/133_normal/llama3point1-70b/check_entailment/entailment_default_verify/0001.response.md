Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The output hints further confirm that the function handles tuples of the same length and performs the subtraction operation element-wise. Although the output hints mention that if the tuples are of different lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the `zip` function, this is a valid behavior and does not affect the correctness of the function as long as the inputs are validated before calling the function. The original assessment accurately reflects the function's behavior and adherence to the problem description.
