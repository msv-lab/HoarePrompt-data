#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length containing numerical values.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of tup2 from tup1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are tuples of the same length containing numerical values. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The function handles tuples of equal length and performs the subtraction operation element-wise. There are no specific edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is assumed that both input tuples are of the same length. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the `zip` function, as it requires inputs of the same length.
