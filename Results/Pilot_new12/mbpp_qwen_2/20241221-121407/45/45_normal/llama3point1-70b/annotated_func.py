    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length greater than 1, `undulating` is True if for every `i` in the range 1 to `len(n) - 2`, the condition `(n[i-1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i+1])` or `(n[i-1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i+1])` holds true, otherwise `undulating` is False.
    return undulating
    #`undulating` is True if for every i in the range 1 to len(n) - 2, the condition (n[i-1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i+1]) or (n[i-1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i+1]) holds true, otherwise `undulating` is False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input. It converts `n` into a string and then checks if the digits of `n` form an undulating sequence. An undulating sequence alternates strictly between increasing and decreasing order. Specifically, for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `len(n) - 2`, the condition `(n[i-1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i+1])` or `(n[i-1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i+1])` must hold true. If the sequence satisfies this condition throughout, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `n` has less than three digits, in which case the function will return `True` because there are no indices to check. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
