Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided output hints, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` does not correctly identify all undulating numbers because it only checks the middle part of the string representation of the number and does not ensure that the alternating pattern continues throughout the entire number. For example, the number `12321` should be classified as undulating because it follows the pattern of alternating digits, but the current implementation will not correctly identify this number as undulating. The original assessment correctly points out this flaw, and the output hints confirm that the function needs to ensure the alternating pattern holds for the entire length of the number. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
