You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]:
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length greater than 1, `undulating` is True if for every `i` in the range 1 to `len(n) - 2`, the condition `(n[i-1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i+1])` or `(n[i-1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i+1])` holds true, otherwise `undulating` is False.
    return undulating
    #`undulating` is True if for every i in the range 1 to len(n) - 2, the condition (n[i-1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i+1]) or (n[i-1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i+1]) holds true, otherwise `undulating` is False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input. It converts `n` into a string and then checks if the digits of `n` form an undulating sequence. An undulating sequence alternates strictly between increasing and decreasing order. Specifically, for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `len(n) - 2`, the condition `(n[i-1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i+1])` or `(n[i-1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i+1])` must hold true. If the sequence satisfies this condition throughout, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `n` has less than three digits, in which case the function will return `True` because there are no indices to check. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
