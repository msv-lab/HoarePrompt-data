Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for checking if a number is undulating. The code checks only the middle part of the number (from the second digit to the second last digit) and does not consider the first and last digits. For a number to be undulating, it must strictly alternate between increasing and decreasing order throughout the entire number. The current implementation fails to check the transition from the first digit to the second digit and from the second last digit to the last digit. 

For example, consider the number `123456`. The code would incorrectly return `True` because it only checks the middle part. However, `123456` is not an undulating number because it does not alternate strictly between increasing and decreasing order from start to end.

A correct implementation should ensure that the sequence strictly alternates between increasing and decreasing order throughout the entire number.
