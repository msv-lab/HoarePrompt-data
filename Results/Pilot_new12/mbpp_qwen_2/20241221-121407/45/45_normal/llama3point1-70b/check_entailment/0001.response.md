Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not correctly identify undulating numbers. An undulating number is defined as a number that has the form ABABAB... or BABABA..., where A and B are different digits. However, the current implementation only checks if the number alternates between two consecutive digits without ensuring that the sequence repeats throughout the entire number. For example, consider the number 12121212. This number alternates between 1 and 2 but does not have the required undulating pattern (it should repeat the pattern continuously). 

To fix this, the function needs to ensure that the alternating pattern continues throughout the entire length of the number. Here is an example where the current implementation fails:

- Input: 12121212
- Expected Output: False (since the pattern does not repeat correctly)
- Actual Output: True (because the function only checks local alternation)

A corrected version of the function could look like this:

```python
def is_undulating(n):
    n = str(n)
    if len(n) < 3:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(n)):
        if (n[i] == n[i - 2] and n[i] != n[i - 1]) or (n[i] != n[i - 2] and n[i] == n[i - 1]):
            pass
        else:
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected function ensures that the alternating pattern continues throughout the entire number.
