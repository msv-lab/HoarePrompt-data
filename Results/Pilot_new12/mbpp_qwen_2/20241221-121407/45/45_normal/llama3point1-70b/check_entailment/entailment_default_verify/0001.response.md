Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` does not correctly identify undulating numbers according to the definition. The function checks for local alternation between two consecutive digits but does not ensure that the alternating pattern continues throughout the entire number. For example, the number 12121212 is incorrectly identified as undulating by the current implementation, whereas it should not be. The output hints confirm that the function only checks for local alternation, which is not sufficient to determine if a number is undulating. The corrected version of the function provided in the original assessment ensures that the alternating pattern continues throughout the entire number, which aligns with the definition of an undulating number. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
