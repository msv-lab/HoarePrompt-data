Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the length of the number `n` is less than 3. According to the problem description, an undulating number must have at least three digits to alternate between increasing and decreasing order. However, the current implementation will return `True` for numbers with less than three digits, which is incorrect. For example, the number `5` would be considered undulating according to the current logic, but it should not be. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
