The code initializes the variable `undulating` to `False`. This does not affect the values of `n` or `i`. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length greater than 1, `i` is previous_i + 1, and the condition for being undulating still needs to be checked; `undulating` is False.**
