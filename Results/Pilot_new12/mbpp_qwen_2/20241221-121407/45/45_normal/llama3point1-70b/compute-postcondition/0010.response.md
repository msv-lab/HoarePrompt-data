The `pass` statement does nothing and simply acts as a placeholder. It does not affect any variables or change the state of the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length greater than 1, `i` is previous_i + 1**
