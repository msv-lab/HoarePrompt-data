Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length greater than 1, `i` is previous_i + 1. If the condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `(n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1])` is true, then the condition for being undulating is satisfied. Otherwise, the condition for being undulating is false, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
