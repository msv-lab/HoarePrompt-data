The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, it exits the loop or conditional block where the condition `1 <= previous_i + 2 < len(n) - 1` was being checked. However, since no loop or conditional block is explicitly shown in the code snippet, we assume the `break` statement is within a loop or conditional block that was previously set up.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length greater than 1.
- `i` is `previous_i + 2`.
- The loop will execute if `1 <= previous_i + 2 < len(n) - 1`.
- `undulating` is `False`.

Since the `break` statement does not change the values of `n`, `i`, `previous_i`, or `undulating`, these variables retain their initial states. The only thing affected by the `break` statement is the exit from the loop or conditional block.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length greater than 1, `i` is `previous_i + 2`, the loop will exit if `1 <= previous_i + 2 < len(n) - 1`, `undulating` is `False`.**
