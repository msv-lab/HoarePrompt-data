Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length greater than 1. If there exists at least one index `i` in the range 1 to len(`n`) - 2 such that (n[i-1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i+1]) or (n[i-1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i+1]), then `n` is undulating. Otherwise, `n` is not undulating.***
