Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
   - `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length greater than 1.
   - `i` is `previous_i + 1`.
   - The condition `n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `(n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1])` determines if the current character satisfies the undulating condition.

2. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over the range `1` to `len(n) - 2`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the valid range of the loop, i.e., `1 <= i < len(n) - 1`.
   - Since `i` is initialized as `previous_i + 1`, the next value of `i` would be `previous_i + 2`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - We need to check if `i` (which will be `previous_i + 2`) is still within the valid range.
   - The condition for the next iteration to occur is `1 <= (previous_i + 2) < len(n) - 1`.
   - Simplifying this, we get `1 <= previous_i + 2 < len(n) - 1`, which means `previous_i >= -1` and `previous_i < len(n) - 3`.

Given these conditions, we can conclude that the loop will execute again if `previous_i + 2` is within the valid range and does not cause an out-of-bounds error.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length greater than 1, `i` is `previous_i + 2`, and the loop will execute if `1 <= previous_i + 2 < len(n) - 1`**.
