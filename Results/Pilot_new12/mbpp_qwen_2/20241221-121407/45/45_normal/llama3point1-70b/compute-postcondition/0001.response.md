The code `undulating = True` assigns the boolean value `True` to the variable `undulating`. This does not affect the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged in terms of the value of `n`, but now `undulating` is set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of the original positive integer, `undulating` is True**
