Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` as input. It converts `n` into a string and then checks if the digits of `n` form an undulating sequence. An undulating sequence alternates strictly between increasing and decreasing order. Specifically, for every index `i` in the range from 1 to `len(n) - 2`, the condition `(n[i-1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i+1])` or `(n[i-1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i+1])` must hold true. If the sequence satisfies this condition throughout, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include when `n` has less than three digits, in which case the function will return `True` because there are no indices to check. There is no missing functionality in the provided code.**
