The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if the digits of `n` meet a specific pattern. Specifically, it verifies if the first two distinct digits of the number, when read as a string, alternate throughout the rest of the number. If the number does not meet this condition, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function handles cases where the number has fewer than three digits by immediately returning `False`.
