Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is defined as a number that has at least three digits and alternates between two different digits. 

The program meets the following criteria:

1. It first checks if the number has fewer than three digits. If so, it returns `False`, which is correct because a number with fewer than three digits cannot be undulating.
2. It then checks if the first two digits are the same. If they are, it returns `False`, as this would violate the requirement of alternating digits.
3. The program uses a loop to check each digit from the third onward:
   - For even indices, it checks if the digit is equal to the first digit.
   - For odd indices, it checks if the digit is equal to the second digit.
4. If all these conditions are met, it returns `True`, indicating that the number is undulating.

Given the provided assertions:
- `func_1(1212121) == True`: This is true because the digits alternate between '1' and '2'.
- `func_1(1991) == False`: This is true because the first two digits are the same ('1' and '9'), violating the alternating condition.
- `func_1(121) == True`: This is true because the digits alternate between '1' and '2'.

Since the program adheres to the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately, it is correct.
