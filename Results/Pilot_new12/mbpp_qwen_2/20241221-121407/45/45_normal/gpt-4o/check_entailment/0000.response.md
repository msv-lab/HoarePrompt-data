Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given number is undulating or not according to the problem description. An undulating number is defined as a number where alternate digits are the same but different from the digit between them. The function checks this condition correctly:

1. It first ensures the number has at least three digits.
2. It checks that the first two digits are different.
3. It then iterates through the remaining digits, ensuring that the digits at even indices match the first digit and the digits at odd indices match the second digit.

The provided test cases also validate this behavior:
- `1212121` returns `True` because it follows the pattern `1212121`.
- `1991` returns `False` because the first two digits (`19`) do not match the subsequent pattern.
- `121` returns `True` because it follows the pattern `121`.

Since the function handles the given examples correctly and no edge cases were found where the function fails, the program is correct.
