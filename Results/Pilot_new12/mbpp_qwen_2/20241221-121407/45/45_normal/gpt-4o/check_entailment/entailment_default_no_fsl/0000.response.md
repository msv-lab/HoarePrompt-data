Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic for checking if a number is undulating. An undulating number is defined as a number where the digits alternate between two different digits. For example, 1212121 is undulating because it alternates between 1 and 2, but 1991 is not because the middle digits (9 and 9) are the same.

The code fails to correctly identify undulating numbers. For instance, the number 1212121 should return `True`, but the current implementation returns `False` because it checks if the first two digits are different, which they are, but it does not properly alternate the digits after the initial pair. Similarly, the number 1991 should return `False`, which it correctly does, but the implementation does not correctly handle all cases of undulating numbers.

To fix this, the code should ensure that the digits strictly alternate between the first and second digits throughout the entire number. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected version ensures that the digits strictly alternate between the first and second digits throughout the entire number.
