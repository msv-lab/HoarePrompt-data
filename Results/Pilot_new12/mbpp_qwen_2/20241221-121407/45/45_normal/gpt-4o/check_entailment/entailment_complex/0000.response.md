Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic required to determine if a given number is undulating. An undulating number is defined as a number where the digits alternate between two different digits. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initial Validation**: The function first checks if the length of the number's string representation (`s`) is less than 3. If so, it returns `False` because an undulating number must have at least three digits. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **First Two Digits Check**: The function then checks if the first two digits are the same. If they are, it returns `False` because an undulating number cannot have the same first two digits. This ensures that there are at least two different digits alternating.

3. **Alternating Digits Check**: Using a for loop, the function iterates through the remaining digits starting from the third digit. It checks that every even-indexed digit is the same as the first digit and every odd-indexed digit is the same as the second digit. This ensures that the digits alternate correctly.

4. **Return True**: If the above conditions are met, the function returns `True`.

Given these steps, the function accurately identifies undulating numbers as per the problem description. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness:

- `1212121` should return `True` because it alternates between `1` and `2`.
- `1991` should return `False` because the first two digits are the same.
- `121` should return `True` because it alternates between `1` and `2`.

Therefore, the program correctly meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
