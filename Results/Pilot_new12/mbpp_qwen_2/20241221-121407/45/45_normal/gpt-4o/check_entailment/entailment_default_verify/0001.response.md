Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly identifies undulating numbers as per the definition provided. The output hints confirm that the function checks for an alternating pattern of digits starting from the first two distinct digits. The function handles cases where the number has fewer than three digits by returning `False`, which aligns with the problem description. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
