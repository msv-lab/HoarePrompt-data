Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the state of the program at different points and supports the correctness of the function `func_1`. The function correctly checks if a number is undulating by ensuring that the digits alternate between two distinct digits. The provided test cases and the logical flow of the code, as annotated, confirm that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
