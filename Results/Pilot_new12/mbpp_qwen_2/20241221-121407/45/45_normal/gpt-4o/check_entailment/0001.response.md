Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a number is undulating. An undulating number is defined as a number that has an alternating pattern of digits (e.g., 1212121, 454545). The function correctly implements this logic:

1. It first converts the number to a string to easily access individual digits.
2. It checks if the length of the string is less than 3, returning `False` if so.
3. It then verifies that the first two digits are different.
4. It iterates through the rest of the digits, ensuring that even-indexed positions match the first digit and odd-indexed positions match the second digit.

Based on the provided test cases:
- `func_1(1212121)` returns `True` (correct).
- `func_1(1991)` returns `False` (correct).
- `func_1(121)` returns `True` (correct).

Additionally, the function handles all potential edge cases and examples that could be tested for undulating numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
