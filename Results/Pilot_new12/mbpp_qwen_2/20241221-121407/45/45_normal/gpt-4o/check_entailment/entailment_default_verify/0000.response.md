Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description and handles the provided test cases accurately. The function checks if the given number is undulating by verifying that alternate digits are the same but different from the digit between them. The output hints also confirm this behavior, stating that the function checks if the first two distinct digits of the number alternate throughout the rest of the number. Since the function handles the cases correctly and the provided test cases validate its behavior, the original assessment is accurate.
