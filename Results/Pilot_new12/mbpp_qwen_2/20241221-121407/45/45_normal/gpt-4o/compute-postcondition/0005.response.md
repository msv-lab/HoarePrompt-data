The code assigns the second character of the string `s` to the variable `second_digit`. Since `s` is a string representation of the positive integer `n` and its length is at least 3, the value of `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` as a character. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` represented as a character, `second_digit` is the second digit of `n` represented as a character.**
