The code assigns the first character of the string `s` to the variable `first_digit`. Since `s` is a string representation of a positive integer `n`, the first character of `s` corresponds to the first digit of `n`. The length of `s` being greater than or equal to 3 means that `s` has at least three digits.

After executing `first_digit = s[0]`, the value of `first_digit` is the first character (or digit) of the string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first digit of `n` represented as a character.**
