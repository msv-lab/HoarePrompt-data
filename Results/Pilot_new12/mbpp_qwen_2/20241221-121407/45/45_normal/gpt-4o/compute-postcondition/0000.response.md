The code `s = str(n)` converts the integer `n` into a string and assigns it to `s`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer; `s` is a string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `s` is a string representation of `n`**
