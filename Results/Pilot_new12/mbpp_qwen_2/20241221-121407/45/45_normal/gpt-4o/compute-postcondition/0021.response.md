According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition `len(s) > 3`. Additionally, the loop body checks if `i % 2 == 1` and `s[i] != second_digit`, returning `False` if both conditions are met.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 3
- `len(s)` is greater than 3
- If `i % 2 == 1` and `s[i] != second_digit`, the function returns `False`

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 4.
- `len(s)` must still be greater than 3.
- The function should not return `False` based on the given conditions, meaning `i % 2 == 0` or `s[i] == second_digit`.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`i` is 4 and `len(s)` is greater than 3. If `i % 2 == 0` or `s[i] == second_digit`, the function continues without changing the values of `i` and `len(s)`**.
