Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and checks if the digits of `n` meet a specific pattern. Specifically, it verifies if the first two distinct digits of the number, when read as a string, alternate throughout the rest of the number. If the number does not meet this condition, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function handles cases where the number has fewer than three digits by immediately returning `False`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` has fewer than three digits, the function returns `False`.
- If the first two digits are the same, the function returns `False`.
- For numbers with more than two distinct digits, the function checks that the digits at even indices match the first digit and the digits at odd indices match the second digit.

**Summary of Final State:**
- After the function concludes, the program will have returned either `True` or `False` based on whether the number `n` satisfies the specified alternating digit pattern.
