The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and returns `True` if the differences between consecutive elements are all 1 and the elements are unique. It first sorts the list `lst`. Then, it checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1 and if all elements in the list are unique. If both conditions are satisfied, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include lists with fewer than two elements, which would automatically fail the consecutive difference check, and lists with duplicate elements, which would also fail the uniqueness check.
