#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the differences between consecutive elements in `lst` are all 1 and the elements in `lst` are unique
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and returns `True` if the differences between consecutive elements are all 1 and the elements are unique. It first sorts the list `lst`. Then, it checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1 and if all elements in the list are unique. If both conditions are satisfied, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include lists with fewer than two elements, which would automatically fail the consecutive difference check, and lists with duplicate elements, which would also fail the uniqueness check.
