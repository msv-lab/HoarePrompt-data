Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and returns `True` if the differences between consecutive elements are all 1 and the elements are unique. It first sorts the list `lst`. Then, it checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1 and if all elements in the list are unique. If both conditions are satisfied, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include lists with fewer than two elements, which would automatically fail the consecutive difference check, and lists with duplicate elements, which would also fail the uniqueness check.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the code, including the sorting step and the two main checks (consecutive differences and uniqueness), while noting the edge cases where the function would return `False`.
