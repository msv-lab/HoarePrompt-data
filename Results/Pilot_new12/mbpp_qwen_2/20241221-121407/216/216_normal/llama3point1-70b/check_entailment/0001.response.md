Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The function first sorts the list, ensuring that consecutive numbers are adjacent. It then uses a generator expression with the `all` function to verify that the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. Additionally, it checks that the length of the list is equal to the number of unique elements, ensuring no duplicates exist which would break the sequence of consecutive numbers. This approach covers all potential cases where the list contains consecutive numbers without duplicates, making the function correct according to the problem description.
