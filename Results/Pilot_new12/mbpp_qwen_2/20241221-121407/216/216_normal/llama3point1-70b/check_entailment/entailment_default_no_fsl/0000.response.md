Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list and then checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1 and if all elements in the list are unique. The function handles edge cases such as lists with fewer than two elements (which would automatically fail the consecutive difference check) and lists with duplicate elements (which would fail the uniqueness check). The code logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
