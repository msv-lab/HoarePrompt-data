Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1(lst)` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here’s why:

1. **Sorting the List**: 
   - The function sorts the list using `lst.sort()`. Sorting ensures that if the list contains consecutive numbers, they will be adjacent in the sorted list.

2. **Checking Consecutive Numbers**:
   - The expression `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` iterates through the sorted list and checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. This ensures that the numbers are consecutive.

3. **Checking Uniqueness**:
   - The expression `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` checks if there are any duplicate elements in the list by comparing the length of the list with the length of a set created from the list. If the lengths are equal, it means all elements in the list are unique.

4. **Logical AND Operation**:
   - The function returns `True` only if both conditions (consecutive numbers and uniqueness) are satisfied. This ensures that the list contains only unique, consecutive numbers.

Since the function meets the criteria specified in the problem description—checking whether the list contains consecutive numbers and ensuring the elements are unique—it is correct.
