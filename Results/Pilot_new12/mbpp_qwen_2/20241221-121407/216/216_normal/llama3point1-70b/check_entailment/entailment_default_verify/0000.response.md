Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list to ensure the numbers are in ascending order, then checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1, and finally ensures that all elements are unique by comparing the length of the list to the length of its set. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases such as lists with fewer than two elements and lists with duplicate elements appropriately. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
