Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers by sorting the list and then verifying that the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. Additionally, it ensures that all elements in the list are unique, which is necessary for the numbers to be considered consecutive. The output hints further support this, indicating that the function handles cases where the list has fewer than two elements and where there are duplicate elements, both of which would fail the consecutive difference and uniqueness checks respectively. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
