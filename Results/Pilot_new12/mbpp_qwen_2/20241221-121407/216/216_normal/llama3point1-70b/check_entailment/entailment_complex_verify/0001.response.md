Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers by first sorting the list and then verifying that the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. Additionally, it ensures that there are no duplicate elements in the list by comparing the length of the list to the length of a set of the list, which removes any duplicates. The annotations correctly describe the function's behavior and confirm that the function meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is valid.
