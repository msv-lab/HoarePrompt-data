Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The annotated version supports this by explaining that the function returns `True` if the differences between consecutive elements in `lst` are all 1 and the elements in `lst` are unique. This aligns with the problem description of checking for consecutive numbers in a list without duplicates. The sorting step ensures that consecutive numbers are adjacent, and the subsequent checks ensure that the numbers form a continuous sequence and are unique. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
