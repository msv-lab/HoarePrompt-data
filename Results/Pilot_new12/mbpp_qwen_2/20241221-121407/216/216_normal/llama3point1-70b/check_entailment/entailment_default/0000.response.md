Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. The function `func_1` first sorts the list and then checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. Additionally, it ensures that all elements in the list are unique. 

- The function handles lists with fewer than two elements, as these will automatically fail the consecutive difference check.
- It correctly identifies duplicate elements by checking the length of the list against the length of the set of the list, ensuring all elements are unique.

Since the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement and the output hints confirm its functionality, the program is correct.
