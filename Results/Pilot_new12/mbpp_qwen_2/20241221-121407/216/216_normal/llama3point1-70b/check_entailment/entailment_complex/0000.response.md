Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and checks whether the elements in the list are consecutive. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Sorting the List**: The list is sorted using `lst.sort()`. Sorting is necessary to ensure that consecutive elements can be compared in order.

2. **Checking Consecutive Differences**: The expression `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` ensures that the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. This is crucial for determining if the numbers are consecutive.

3. **Ensuring Uniqueness**: The expression `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` ensures that all elements in the list are unique. If there are duplicates, this condition will fail, ensuring that the function returns `False`.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - For lists with fewer than two elements, the function will return `False` because the difference check cannot be performed (since there are no pairs of consecutive elements).
   - Lists with duplicate elements will also return `False` due to the uniqueness check.

5. **Assumptions**: As mentioned, the program assumes valid inputs. If the input is always a list of integers, the function will work as expected.

Given these points, the program correctly checks for consecutive numbers in the list and handles all specified edge cases, making it conform to the problem description.
