Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list and then uses the `all` function to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. Additionally, it ensures that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list, which confirms that all elements are unique and thus can form a sequence without repetition. This approach correctly identifies lists that contain consecutive numbers and correctly handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists with duplicate elements. Since the program works correctly for all tested cases and potential scenarios, the correctness is **True**.
