#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: lst is a list of integers, and lst is not empty
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least `len(lst_sorted)` elements, `i` is `len(lst_sorted) - 2`. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function will continue to check until the end of the loop, ensuring that all consecutive pairs in `lst_sorted` have a difference of 1.
    return True
    #The program returns True if all consecutive pairs in `lst_sorted` have a difference of 1, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, the function returns `False`. If the list is not empty, the function sorts the list and then iterates through the sorted list to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. If all pairs meet this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function covers all edge cases, including an empty list, a list with non-consecutive integers, and a list with consecutive integers.
