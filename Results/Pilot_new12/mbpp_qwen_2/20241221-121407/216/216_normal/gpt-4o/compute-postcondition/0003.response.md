`lst_sorted` is assigned the value of `sorted(lst)`, which sorts the list `lst` in ascending order. Since `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` will also be a list of integers in ascending order. The original list `lst` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, and lst is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order**
