The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function returns False in the first four cases and returns True if all consecutive pairs in `lst_sorted` (which is the sorted version of `lst`) have a difference of 1, otherwise it returns False.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return True if all consecutive pairs in the sorted version of `lst` have a difference of 1, otherwise it returns False.
