State before the loop starts: `lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's break down the for loop:

```
for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(lst_sorted) - 2` (inclusive). This means the loop requires `len(lst_sorted)` to be at least 2 because the upper bound is `len(lst_sorted) - 1`.

2. **Variables Involved**: The loop involves the variable `i` and the list `lst_sorted`.

3. **Initial States**:
   - `lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty.
   - `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop condition depends on `len(lst_sorted)`, `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute. Therefore, `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 2.
   - The initial value of `i` is 0.

5. **Summary of Adjusted States**:
   - `lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty.
   - `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order, and `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 2.
   - `i` must be 0 at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the final state required for the loop to execute is:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers, and `lst` is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order, and `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 2, `i` is 0**
