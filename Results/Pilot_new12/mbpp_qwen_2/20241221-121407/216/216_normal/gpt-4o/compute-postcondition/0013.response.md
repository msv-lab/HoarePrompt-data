Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
