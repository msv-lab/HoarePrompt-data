Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least `len(lst_sorted)` elements, `i` is `len(lst_sorted) - 2`. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function will continue to check until the end of the loop, ensuring that all consecutive pairs in `lst_sorted` have a difference of 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(lst_sorted) - 2`.
- For each iteration, it checks if the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is equal to 1.
- If any pair does not satisfy this condition, the function returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means that every consecutive pair in `lst_sorted` has a difference of 1.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `len(lst_sorted) < 2`), the function does not return `False` because the condition for the loop to run (`len(lst_sorted) - 1` being non-negative) is not met. Therefore, `lst_sorted` is assumed to be a list with less than 2 elements, and no further checks are performed.

Thus, the final output state is that `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least `len(lst_sorted)` elements, `i` is `len(lst_sorted) - 2`, and the function returns `True` only if all consecutive pairs in `lst_sorted` have a difference of 1.
