Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, the function returns `False`. If the list is not empty, the function sorts the list and then iterates through the sorted list to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. If all pairs meet this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function covers all edge cases, including an empty list, a list with non-consecutive integers, and a list with consecutive integers.**
