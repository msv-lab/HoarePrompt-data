Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States**:
   - `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty.
   - `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order.
   - `len(lst_sorted)` is at least 2.
   - `i` is 0.
   - The difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is equal to 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i` to `len(lst_sorted) - 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is 0.
   - The condition `lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] == 1` holds true (since `i` is 0, this means `lst_sorted[1] - lst_sorted[0] == 1`).

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 1.

5. **State Adjustments**:
   - `i` is now 1.
   - The condition `lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] == 1` must still hold true. This means `lst_sorted[2] - lst_sorted[1] == 1`.

Given these points, the updated states are:

- `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty.
- `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order.
- `len(lst_sorted)` is at least 2.
- `i` is 1.
- The difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is equal to 1.

So, the final state is:

**State: `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order, `len(lst_sorted)` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is equal to 1.**
