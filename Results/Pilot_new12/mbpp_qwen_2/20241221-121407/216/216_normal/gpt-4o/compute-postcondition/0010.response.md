Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order, `len(lst_sorted)` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and the overall state is as follows: if the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues with the next iteration of the loop, ensuring that `i` is incremented and the condition `lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] == 1` is maintained.**
