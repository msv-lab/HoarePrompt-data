According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:
- `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty.
- `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order.
- `len(lst_sorted)` is at least 2.
- `i` is 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(lst_sorted) - 1` must be true. Since `i` is currently 1, `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
- `len(lst_sorted)` must be at least 3 to ensure the loop condition is met.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
