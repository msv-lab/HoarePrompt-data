Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. **Empty List Handling**: The program first checks if the list is empty using `if (not lst): return False`. If the list is empty, the function immediately returns `False`, which aligns with the requirement to handle an empty list.

2. **Sorting and Consecutive Check**: For non-empty lists, the program sorts the list (`lst_sorted = sorted(lst)`) and then iterates through the sorted list to ensure that the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. This is achieved by checking `if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1: return False`.

3. **Return True if All Pairs Meet Condition**: If the loop completes without finding any pairs with a difference other than 1, the function returns `True`. This ensures that the list is checked thoroughly for consecutive numbers.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge cases mentioned in the problem description, such as:
   - An empty list: Returns `False`.
   - A list with non-consecutive integers: Returns `False`.
   - A list with consecutive integers: Returns `True`.

Given these points, the program `func_1` correctly checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
