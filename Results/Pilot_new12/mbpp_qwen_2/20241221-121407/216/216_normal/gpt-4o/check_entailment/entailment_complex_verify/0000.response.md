Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear and detailed explanation of the program's behavior, which aligns with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. It handles all potential cases, including an empty list, a list with non-consecutive integers, and a list with consecutive integers. The provided test cases also confirm the function's correctness. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
