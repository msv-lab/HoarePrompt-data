Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The function first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. If the list is not empty, it sorts the list and then iterates through the sorted list to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. If all pairs meet this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The annotated version clearly shows that the function handles the following cases correctly:
1. An empty list: Returns `False`.
2. A list with consecutive numbers: Returns `True`.
3. A list with non-consecutive numbers: Returns `False`.

The provided test cases and the annotated version confirm that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
