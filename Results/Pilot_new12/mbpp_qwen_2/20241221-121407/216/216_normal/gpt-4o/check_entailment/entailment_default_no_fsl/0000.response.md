Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The function `func_1` handles various cases, including an empty list, a list with non-consecutive integers, and a list with consecutive integers. The logic of sorting the list and then checking the difference between each pair of consecutive elements ensures that the function works for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios that the provided code does not handle correctly.
