Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. The function first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then it sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each pair of adjacent elements has a difference of 1. 

The provided test cases cover some basic scenarios:
1. A list with consecutive numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `True`.
2. A list with non-consecutive numbers `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` returns `False`.
3. A list with duplicate numbers and non-consecutive order `[1, 2, 1]` returns `False`.

Given these test cases, the function appears to handle the core requirement correctly. Since sorting is used, the function will correctly identify whether the original list has consecutive numbers regardless of their initial order. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios that the provided function does not handle, so we can conclude that the function is correct for the given problem description.
