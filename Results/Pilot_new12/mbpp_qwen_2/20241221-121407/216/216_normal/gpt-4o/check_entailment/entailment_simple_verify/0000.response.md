Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The annotations support this correctness:

1. The function first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is.
2. It then sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each pair of adjacent elements has a difference of 1.
3. If any pair of adjacent elements does not have a difference of 1, the function returns `False`.
4. If all pairs of adjacent elements have a difference of 1, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness:
- `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `True` because the numbers are consecutive.
- `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` returns `False` because the numbers are not consecutive.
- `[1, 2, 1]` returns `False` because the numbers are not in order, which is necessary for them to be considered consecutive.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
