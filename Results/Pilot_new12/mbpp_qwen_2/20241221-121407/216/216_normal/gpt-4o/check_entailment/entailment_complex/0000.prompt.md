You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: lst is a list of integers, and lst is not empty
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a list of integers in ascending order with at least `len(lst_sorted)` elements, `i` is `len(lst_sorted) - 2`. If the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function will continue to check until the end of the loop, ensuring that all consecutive pairs in `lst_sorted` have a difference of 1.
    return True
    #The program returns True if all consecutive pairs in `lst_sorted` have a difference of 1, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It first checks if the list is empty; if it is, the function returns `False`. If the list is not empty, the function sorts the list and then iterates through the sorted list to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. If all pairs meet this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function covers all edge cases, including an empty list, a list with non-consecutive integers, and a list with consecutive integers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
