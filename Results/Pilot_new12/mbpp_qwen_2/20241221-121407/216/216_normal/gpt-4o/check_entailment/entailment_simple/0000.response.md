Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the function meets the problem description:

1. **Empty List Handling**: The function starts by checking if the list is empty using `if (not lst):`. If the list is empty, it immediately returns `False`, which is the correct behavior as an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting the List**: The function sorts the list using `lst_sorted = sorted(lst)`. Sorting the list ensures that the elements are in ascending order, making it easier to check for consecutive numbers.

3. **Checking Consecutive Numbers**: The function then iterates through the sorted list using a `for` loop to check the difference between each pair of adjacent elements. Specifically, it checks if `lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] == 1` for all pairs. If any pair does not meet this condition, the function returns `False`.

4. **Returning the Result**: If the loop completes without finding any non-consecutive pairs, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

The function correctly handles all cases described in the problem description:
- It returns `False` for an empty list.
- It correctly identifies lists with missing consecutive numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`).
- It also correctly identifies lists that are not entirely in sequence (e.g., `[1, 2, 1]`).

Since the function behaves as expected for all the given test cases and handles the edge cases (empty list and lists with missing or out-of-order numbers), the function is correct according to the problem description.
