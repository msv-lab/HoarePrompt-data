Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. The function first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. If the list is not empty, it sorts the list and then iterates through the sorted list to check if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. If all pairs meet this condition, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the problem description and the provided assertions, the code appears to handle all the examples correctly:
- It returns `True` for a list of consecutive numbers (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`).
- It returns `False` for a list with non-consecutive numbers (`[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`).
- It returns `False` for a list that is not fully consecutive due to a duplicate (`[1, 2, 1]`).

The code also handles the case where the input list is empty, which is another potential edge case. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
