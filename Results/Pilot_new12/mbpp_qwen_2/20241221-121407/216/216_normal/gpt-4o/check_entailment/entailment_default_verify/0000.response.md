Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description of checking whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The provided output hints confirm that the function handles various scenarios, including an empty list, lists with non-consecutive integers, and lists with consecutive integers. The function first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is, ensuring it covers the edge case. It then sorts the list and checks the difference between each pair of consecutive elements, which accurately determines if the list contains consecutive numbers. Since the function correctly implements the logic and the output hints validate its functionality, the original assessment is accurate.
