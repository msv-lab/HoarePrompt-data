Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the code functionality. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers by first handling the case where the list is empty and then sorting the list to ensure that the numbers are in order. It then iterates through the sorted list to verify that the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including lists with consecutive numbers, non-consecutive numbers, and duplicate numbers, which confirms that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
