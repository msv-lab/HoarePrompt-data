Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The function first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then it sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each pair of adjacent elements has a difference of 1. This approach works for all potential cases where the list contains consecutive numbers or not. The examples provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for both valid and invalid cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
