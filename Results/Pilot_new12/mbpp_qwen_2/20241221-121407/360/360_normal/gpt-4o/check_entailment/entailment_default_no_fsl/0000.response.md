Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through each sublist in the input list of lists, calculates the sum of elements in each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. The code handles all the provided test cases and potential edge cases mentioned in the output hints. Specifically:

1. It correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum from non-empty inputs.
2. It handles the case where all sublists have the same sum (e.g., `[[1, 1], [1, 1]]` would return either `[1, 1]`).
3. It correctly handles empty sublists and empty lists of lists (although the problem description and hints do not explicitly mention these cases, they are handled correctly without causing any errors).

Since the code works correctly for all the provided test cases and potential edge cases, the program is correct.
