Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding list whenever a higher sum is found. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including lists with varying lengths and positive integers. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list of lists, where it correctly returns an empty list (which has a sum of zero). Since the function meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment remains valid.
