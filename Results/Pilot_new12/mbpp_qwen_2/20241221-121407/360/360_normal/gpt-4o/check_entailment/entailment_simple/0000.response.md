Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `max_sum` is initialized to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`), ensuring that any sum encountered during iteration will be greater than this initial value. The `max_list` is initialized as an empty list, which will store the sublist with the highest sum once found.

2. **Iteration and Comparison**: The program iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`. For each sublist, it calculates the sum using the `sum()` function. If this sum is greater than the current `max_sum`, the program updates both `max_sum` and `max_list`.

3. **Return Statement**: After iterating through all sublists, the program returns `max_list`, which contains the sublist with the highest sum.

The provided test cases validate different scenarios:
- A list containing multiple sublists with varying sums (e.g., `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]`).
- A list with sublists of similar sums (e.g., `[[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]`).
- A list with a single sublist (e.g., `[[2, 3, 1]]`).

In each case, the program correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum and returns it. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
