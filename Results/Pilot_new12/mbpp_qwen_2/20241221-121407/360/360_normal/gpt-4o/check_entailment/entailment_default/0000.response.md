Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through each sublist in the given `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of elements in each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the highest sum. If multiple sublists have the same highest sum, it returns the first one encountered. The provided assertions cover different scenarios including non-empty lists with varying sums and single-element sublists. The code handles these cases correctly, and there are no apparent issues with edge cases like empty sublists or an empty list of lists, as it will simply return an empty list in such cases, which aligns with the expected behavior.
