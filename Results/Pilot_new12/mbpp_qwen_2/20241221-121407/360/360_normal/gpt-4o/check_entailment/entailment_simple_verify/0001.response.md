Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the state of the program at different points, and it aligns with the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function correctly initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list. It iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of each sublist, and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` when a higher sum is found. After the loop, the function returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum. The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected for different scenarios, including lists with varying lengths and positive integers. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
