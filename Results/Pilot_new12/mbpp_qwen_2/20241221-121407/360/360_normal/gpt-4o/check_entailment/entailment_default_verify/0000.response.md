Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements among all the sublists. The output hints confirm that the function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding list whenever a higher sum is found. The function handles edge cases such as an empty list of lists or sublists with only zero values by correctly identifying the sublist with the highest sum, which could be an empty list if all sublists have a sum of zero. The provided assertions also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is justified.
