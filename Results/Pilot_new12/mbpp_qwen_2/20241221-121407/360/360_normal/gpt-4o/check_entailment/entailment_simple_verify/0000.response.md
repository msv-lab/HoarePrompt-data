Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the list within a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The annotated version clearly describes the state of the program at different stages, confirming that the function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding list whenever a higher sum is found. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
