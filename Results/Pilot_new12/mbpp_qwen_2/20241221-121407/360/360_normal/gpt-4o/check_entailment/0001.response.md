Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The logic iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding list whenever a higher sum is found. The provided test cases cover different scenarios including lists with varying lengths and positive integers. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential input that would make this function incorrect based on the problem description.
