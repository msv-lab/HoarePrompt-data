Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements among all the sublists. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding list whenever a higher sum is found. The given test cases and the general logic of the function ensure that it works correctly for all potential cases where the input is a list of lists of integers. There are no issues or edge cases identified that would cause the function to fail based on the provided information. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
