Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. Based on the provided code and the annotated version, the function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The logic iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding list whenever a higher sum is found. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including lists with varying lengths and positive integers. The annotated version supports that the function correctly handles various inputs and edge cases, such as empty lists or sublists with only zero values. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
