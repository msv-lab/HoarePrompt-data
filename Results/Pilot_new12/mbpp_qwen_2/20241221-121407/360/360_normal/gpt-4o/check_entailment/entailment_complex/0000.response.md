Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to find and return the sublist with the highest sum of elements from a given list of lists. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `max_sum` is initialized to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`) to ensure any sum of elements from the sublists will be larger initially.
   - `max_list` is initialized to an empty list to store the sublist with the highest sum.

2. **Iteration and Sum Calculation**:
   - The program iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements using `sum(sublist)` and stores it in `current_sum`.

3. **Comparison and Update**:
   - If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` to `current_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist.

4. **Return Statement**:
   - After completing the iteration, the program returns `max_list`, which holds the sublist with the highest sum.

The provided assertions also validate different scenarios:
- A list of multiple sublists with varying sums.
- A list with a single sublist.
- Ensuring that the function handles both positive and negative sums correctly.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all potential valid inputs as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
