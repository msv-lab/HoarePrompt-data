Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements among all the sublists. The function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding list whenever a higher sum is found. The given test cases and the general logic of the function ensure that it works correctly for all potential cases where the input is a list of lists of integers. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where this function would fail based on the provided information.
