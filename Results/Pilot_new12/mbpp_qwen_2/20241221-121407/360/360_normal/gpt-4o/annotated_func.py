#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists of integers.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `max_sum` is the sum of the elements in the sublist with the highest sum, and `max_list` is the sublist with the highest sum.
    return max_list
    #The program returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It iterates through each sublist to calculate the sum of its elements. If the sum of the current sublist is greater than the previously recorded maximum sum (`max_sum`), it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist. Finally, the function returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum. This process ensures that the function identifies and returns the sublist containing the largest sum of elements. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `list_of_lists` is empty or contains sublists with only zero values. In such cases, the function will still correctly identify and return the sublist with the highest sum, which could be an empty list if all sublists have a sum of zero.
