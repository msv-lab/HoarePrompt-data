Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` remains unchanged, and `max_list` remains unchanged. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to `sublist`.***
