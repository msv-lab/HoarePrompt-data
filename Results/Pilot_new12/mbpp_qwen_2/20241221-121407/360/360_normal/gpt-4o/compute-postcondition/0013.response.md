According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. For the loop to execute again, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist.
- `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.
- If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to `sublist`. Otherwise, the values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
- `list_of_lists` must still contain at least one sublist.
- The values of `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_list` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless they have already been updated during this iteration.

Since we are only considering the state at the start of the next iteration and no updates to `current_sum`, `max_sum`, or `max_list` are mentioned in the example, these values remain the same.

State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to `sublist`, otherwise, the values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.**
