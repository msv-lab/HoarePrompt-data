The code `max_sum = current_sum` updates the value of `max_sum` to the current value of `current_sum`. The value of `max_list` remains unchanged, and the previous state of `current_sum` is now stored in `max_sum`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is updated to the current sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the current sublist and is greater than the previous `max_sum`**
