The code assigns the value of `current_sum` to `max_sum`. This means that `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, and `current_sum` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`**
