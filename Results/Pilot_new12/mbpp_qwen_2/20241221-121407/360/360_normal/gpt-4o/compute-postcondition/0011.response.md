`max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. The original values of `current_sum` and `max_sum` remain unchanged because the code only assigns `sublist` to `max_list` without affecting these two variables.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`**
