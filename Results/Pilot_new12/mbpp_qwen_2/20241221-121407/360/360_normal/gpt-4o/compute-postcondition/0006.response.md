The code assigns the variable `sublist` to `max_list`. The previous value of `max_list` was the current sublist, and `max_sum` was equal to `current_sum`, which was greater than the previous `max_sum`. After executing the code, `max_list` is updated to `sublist`, but the values of `max_sum` and `current_sum` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is updated to `sublist`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the current sublist and is greater than the previous `max_sum`**
