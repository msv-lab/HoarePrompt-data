The code initializes an empty list named `max_list`. The previous values of the other variables (`list_of_lists` and `max_sum`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is `-inf`, `max_list` is an empty list**
