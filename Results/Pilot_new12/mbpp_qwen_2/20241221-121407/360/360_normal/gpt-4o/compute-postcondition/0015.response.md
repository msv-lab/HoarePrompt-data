`max_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`. The value of `current_sum` remains unchanged from its previous state, and the values of `list_of_lists`, `max_sum`, and `max_list` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` is now equal to `current_sum`, and `max_list` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, and `max_list` remains unchanged.**
