`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `sublist`. The `sum(sublist)` function calculates the sum of all elements in the current sublist. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `max_sum` is -inf, `max_list` is an empty list, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the current sublist**
