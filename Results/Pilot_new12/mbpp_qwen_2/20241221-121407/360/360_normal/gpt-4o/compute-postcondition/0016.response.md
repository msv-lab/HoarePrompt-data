`max_list` is reassigned to the value of `sublist`. The original value of `max_list` is no longer relevant since it is now set to `sublist`. The `current_sum` and `max_sum` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, and `max_list` is equal to `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, and `max_list` is equal to `sublist`**
