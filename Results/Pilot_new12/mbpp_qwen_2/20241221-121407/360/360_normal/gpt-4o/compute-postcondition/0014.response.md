The code calculates the sum of the elements in `sublist` and assigns it to `current_sum`. This does not affect `max_sum` or `max_list` unless `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, in which case `max_sum` and `max_list` would be updated. Since the condition to update `max_sum` and `max_list` is not met (it is only checked later in the code), their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, `max_sum` remains unchanged, and `max_list` remains unchanged.**
