Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist. After executing the if statement, if the current sum (`current_sum`) is greater than the maximum sum (`max_sum`), then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to the current sublist. If `current_sum` is not greater than the previous `max_sum`, the values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.***
