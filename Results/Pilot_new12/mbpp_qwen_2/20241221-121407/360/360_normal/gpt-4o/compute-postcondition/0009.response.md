`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `sublist`. The value of `sublist` is part of `list_of_lists`, but the specific sublist is not specified in the initial state, so we can denote it as `sublist` which is an element of `list_of_lists`. The sum of `sublist` is stored in `current_sum`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`**
