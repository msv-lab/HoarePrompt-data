To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the information provided and the loop logic step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist.
  - After executing the if statement, if the current sum (`current_sum`) is greater than the maximum sum (`max_sum`), then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is updated to the current sublist.
  - If `current_sum` is not greater than the previous `max_sum`, the values of `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

### Loop Logic:
```python
for sublist in list_of_lists:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Check if the loop can execute:**
   - The loop iterates over each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`.
   - Since it is specified that `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, the loop will always execute at least once unless `list_of_lists` becomes empty during the iteration (which is not mentioned).

2. **Determine the state adjustments:**
   - The loop will continue to the next iteration as long as there are more sublists in `list_of_lists`.
   - No specific changes are made to `current_sum`, `max_sum`, or `max_list` at the end of the loop unless the conditions inside the if statement are met.
   - Therefore, `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_list` remain unchanged from their values at the start of the current iteration.

### Conclusion:
Since no specific changes are made to `current_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_list` at the end of the loop, and the only condition affecting the loop execution is the presence of sublists in `list_of_lists`, the state remains the same as at the start of the current iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist.**
