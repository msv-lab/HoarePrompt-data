According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. The loop will execute if `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist.

Before the loop starts:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers.
- `max_sum` is `-inf`.
- `max_list` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one sublist, `max_sum` is -inf, `max_list` is an empty list**
