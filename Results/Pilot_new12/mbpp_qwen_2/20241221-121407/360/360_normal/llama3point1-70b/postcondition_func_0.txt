The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It returns the inner list from `lists` that has the maximum sum when the `sum` function is applied to each inner list. If multiple inner lists have the same maximum sum, it returns one of them (the first encountered). If `lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` because there are no inner lists to compare.
