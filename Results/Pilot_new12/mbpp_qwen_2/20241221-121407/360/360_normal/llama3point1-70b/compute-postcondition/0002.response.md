Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It returns the inner list from `lists` that has the maximum sum when the `sum` function is applied to each inner list. If multiple inner lists have the same maximum sum, it returns one of them (the first encountered). If `lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` because there are no inner lists to compare.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `lists` is an empty list, the function will raise a `ValueError` since there are no inner lists to find the maximum sum.
- If all inner lists are empty, the function will still return one of them, as the `max` function will return the first item in case of a tie.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no explicit handling for the case where `lists` contains non-integer values. If `lists` contains any non-integer values, the function will raise a `TypeError` because the `sum` function cannot sum non-integer values. This behavior should be noted in the description.
