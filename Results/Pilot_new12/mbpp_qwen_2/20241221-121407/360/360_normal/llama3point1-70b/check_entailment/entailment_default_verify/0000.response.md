Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements among the given list of lists. The `max` function with the `key=sum` argument finds the list that maximizes the sum of its elements. The output hints confirm that the function handles valid inputs appropriately and raises an error only when the input list is empty, which is a valid edge case but does not make the function incorrect. Since the problem description asks for the list with the highest sum, and the function meets this requirement, the original assessment is correct.
