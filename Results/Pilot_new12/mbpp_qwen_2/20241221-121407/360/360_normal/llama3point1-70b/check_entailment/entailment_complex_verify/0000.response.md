Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements among the given list of lists. The annotations further clarify that the function accepts a list of lists of integers and returns the inner list with the maximum sum. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected under the assumption of valid input. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
