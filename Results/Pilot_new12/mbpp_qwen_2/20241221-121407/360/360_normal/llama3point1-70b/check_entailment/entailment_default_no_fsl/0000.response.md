Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses the `max` function with `key=sum` to find the inner list with the highest sum. This approach works for all potential cases, including when there are multiple inner lists with the same maximum sum (it will return the first one encountered), and when the input list is empty (though the code does not explicitly handle this case, raising a `ValueError` as mentioned in the output hints is appropriate behavior for this scenario under the assumption that the input will always be valid).
