Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists of integers and returns the inner list with the highest sum. If there are multiple inner lists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them (the first encountered). The code uses the `max` function with the `key` parameter set to `sum`, which compares the sums of the inner lists and returns the one with the highest sum. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code fails to handle, and the behavior aligns with the problem requirements. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case within the given constraints.
