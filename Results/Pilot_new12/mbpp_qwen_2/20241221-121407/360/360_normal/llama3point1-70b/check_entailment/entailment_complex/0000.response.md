Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`lists`) as input and returns the inner list with the highest sum of its elements. This is achieved using the `max` function with `key=sum`, which correctly identifies the list with the maximum sum. The program handles the case where `lists` is empty by raising a `ValueError`, as there would be no lists to compare. Therefore, the program always follows the problem description for every potential valid case.
