Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the highest sum of its elements using the `max` function with `key=sum`. This approach is correct and will work for all valid inputs where the input is a non-empty list of non-empty lists of integers or floats. There are no edge cases or special scenarios that this function does not handle as per the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
