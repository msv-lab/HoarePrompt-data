Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument to find and return the list within the input list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The annotation clearly states that the input `lists` is a list of lists of integers, which aligns with the problem description requiring a function to return the list with the highest sum of elements. Therefore, the program meets the requirements as described and the original assessment is correct.
