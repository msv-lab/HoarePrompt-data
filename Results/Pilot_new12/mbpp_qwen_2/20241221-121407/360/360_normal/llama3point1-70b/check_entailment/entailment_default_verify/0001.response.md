Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find and return the list with the highest sum from a list of lists. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the list with the maximum sum, and raises a `ValueError` for an empty input list, which aligns with the problem description. Since the program handles all valid cases and no invalid inputs are considered (as per the assumption), the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
