Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the list within a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The annotation confirms that the function works by using the `max` function with `key=sum`, which ensures that the list with the maximum sum is returned. Although the annotation mentions that the function will raise a `ValueError` if `lists` is empty, this is not a problem under the assumption that the input will always be valid as stated in the instructions. Therefore, the function meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
