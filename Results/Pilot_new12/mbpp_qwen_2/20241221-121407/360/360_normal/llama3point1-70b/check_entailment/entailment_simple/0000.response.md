Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns the list with the highest sum of its elements. This is achieved using the `max` function with the `key=sum` argument, which correctly identifies the list with the maximum sum among all the inner lists. Since the problem description asks for a function that returns the list with the highest sum, and the program accomplishes this task accurately, the program is correct.
