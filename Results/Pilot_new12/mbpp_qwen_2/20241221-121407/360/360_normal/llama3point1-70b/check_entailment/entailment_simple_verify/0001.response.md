Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the list within a given list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The function uses the `max` function with `key=sum`, which is a correct approach for solving the problem described. Since the input is assumed to be valid (a non-empty list of non-empty lists), the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The annotated version supports this reasoning by clearly stating that the program returns a list from `lists` which has the maximum sum when the `sum` function is applied to each inner list.
