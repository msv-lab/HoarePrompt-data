#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists of integers.
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns a list from `lists` which has the maximum sum when the `sum` function is applied to each inner list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists of integers. It returns the inner list from `lists` that has the maximum sum when the `sum` function is applied to each inner list. If multiple inner lists have the same maximum sum, it returns one of them (the first encountered). If `lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` because there are no inner lists to compare.
