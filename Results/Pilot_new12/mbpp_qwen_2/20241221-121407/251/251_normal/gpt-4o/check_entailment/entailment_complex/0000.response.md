Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Î¸). Here's why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
2. **Function Implementation**: The function `func_1(x, y)`:
   - Calculates the Euclidean distance `r` using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).
   - Computes the angle `theta` in radians using `math.atan2(y, x)`.
   - Returns both `r` and `theta`.

The function `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)` correctly computes the Euclidean distance `r`. The `math.atan2(y, x)` function computes the angle `theta` between the positive x-axis and the line segment from the origin to the point `(x, y)`, which is exactly what is required.

Given the problem description and the function implementation, the function consistently performs the conversion as specified. Therefore, the program is correct.
