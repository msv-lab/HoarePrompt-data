Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It uses the formulas \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and \( \theta = \text{math.atan2}(y, x) \) to calculate the radius \( r \) and the angle \( \theta \) respectively. The `math.atan2(y, x)` function is used properly to handle all edge cases, including when \( x \) or \( y \) is zero. The examples given in the output hints also confirm that the function works as expected for various inputs. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
