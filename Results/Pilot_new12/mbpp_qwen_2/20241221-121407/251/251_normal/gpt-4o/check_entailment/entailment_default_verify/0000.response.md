Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, θ)`. The function uses the appropriate mathematical formulas and the `math.atan2` function to ensure the correct quadrant for the angle `θ`. The output hints further confirm this by specifying that the function calculates the Euclidean distance `r` and the angle `θ` in radians, which aligns with the problem description. Since the provided test cases pass and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and output hints, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
