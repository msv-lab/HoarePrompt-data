Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The annotations clarify that the function calculates the radius `r` as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` and the angle `theta` as the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment joining the origin with the point `(x, y)`. The use of `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)` for the radius and `math.atan2(y, x)` for the angle ensures that the function handles all edge cases appropriately, including when `x` or `y` is zero. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
