Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the appropriate mathematical formulas. The use of `math.sqrt` for calculating the radius `r` and `math.atan2` for the angle `theta` ensures the correct handling of quadrants. The provided assertions with different sets of coordinates confirm that the function works as expected. The output hints further validate that the function correctly calculates both the radius and the angle in radians. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
