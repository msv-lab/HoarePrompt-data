Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It calculates the radius \( r \) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle \( \theta \) using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which handles all edge cases appropriately, including when \( x \) or \( y \) is zero. The examples given also match the expected outputs, confirming that the code works correctly for the provided test cases. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
