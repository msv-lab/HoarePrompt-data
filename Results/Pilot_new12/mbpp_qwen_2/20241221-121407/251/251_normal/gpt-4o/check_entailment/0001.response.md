Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and \( \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \). The function uses `math.sqrt` for the radius calculation and `math.atan2` for the angle calculation, which handles the quadrant issues automatically. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. Since the function appears to handle all tested cases accurately and there are no obvious logical errors or edge cases that the function fails to address, the program is considered correct.
