Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The radius `r` is calculated using the Euclidean distance formula, and the angle `theta` is determined using the `math.atan2` function, which accounts for the correct quadrant of the angle. The provided assertions validate the function against known correct values, and the annotations align with the expected behavior of the function. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
