Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates.
2. **Radius Calculation**: The radius `r` is calculated using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y).
3. **Angle Calculation**: The angle `θ` is calculated using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment that joins the origin with the point (x, y). This function correctly handles the quadrant issues that `math.atan` might miss.
4. **Return Values**: The function returns both `r` and `θ` as a tuple, which is consistent with the requirement to return polar coordinates.

Given the assertions provided, the function correctly produces the expected outputs for the given inputs. Since the problem description requires converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, and the provided function performs this conversion accurately, the program is correct.
