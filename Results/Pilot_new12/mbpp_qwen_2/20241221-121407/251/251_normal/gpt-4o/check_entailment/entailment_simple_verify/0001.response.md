Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the formulas \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) for the radius and \( \theta = \arctan\left(\frac{y}{x}\right) \) for the angle. The use of `math.sqrt` for the radius and `math.atan2` for the angle ensures that the calculations are correct and handle all quadrants appropriately. The provided test cases also confirm the correctness of the function for the given inputs. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
