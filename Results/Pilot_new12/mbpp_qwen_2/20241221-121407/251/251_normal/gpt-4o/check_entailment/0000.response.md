Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, θ)`. It calculates the radius `r` using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle `θ` using the formula \( θ = \mathbf{atan2}(y, x) \). The `math.atan2` function is used to handle the correct quadrant for the angle, which is essential for accurate polar coordinate conversion. Given the provided test cases and the general understanding of the formulas, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
