Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point. It calculates the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin (0,0) to the point `(x, y)` using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). Additionally, it computes the angle `theta` in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment joining the origin with the point `(x, y)` using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function. The function returns these two values `r` and `theta`. This function handles all edge cases appropriately, including when `x` or `y` is zero.**

- The function correctly computes the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)`.
- It accurately calculates the angle `theta` using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which handles all quadrants and edge cases where `x` or `y` might be zero.
