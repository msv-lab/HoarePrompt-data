The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates. The function calculates the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` and the angle `theta` in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment that joins the origin with the point `(x, y)`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two real numbers `x` and `y`, and return the Euclidean distance `r` and the angle `theta` in radians.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `x` and `y`, returns the Euclidean distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` and the angle `theta` in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment that joins the origin with the point `(x, y)`.**
