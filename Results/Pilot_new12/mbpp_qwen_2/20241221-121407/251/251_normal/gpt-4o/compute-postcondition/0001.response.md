`theta` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)` in the Cartesian coordinate system. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a real number, `y` is a real number, `theta` is math.atan2(y, x).

Output State: **`x` is a real number, `y` is a real number, `theta` is math.atan2(y, x)**
