The code calculates the radius `r` using the formula for the Euclidean distance in a 2D plane, which is `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`. This means `r` is assigned the value of the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`.

Output State: **`x` is a real number, `y` is a real number, `r` is math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)**
