Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, phi)`. It uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radius `r` as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`, and `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle `phi` in radians. The function handles the case where `x` is zero, ensuring that the angle `phi` is calculated appropriately. Given the problem description and the output hints, there are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case under the given assumptions.
