Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, phi) using the appropriate mathematical functions from the `math` module. Specifically, `math.hypot(x, y)` computes the Euclidean distance \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), and `math.atan2(y, x)` computes the angle \( \phi \) in radians, handling edge cases such as when \( x \) is zero. The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles these cases and provides the expected polar coordinates. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
