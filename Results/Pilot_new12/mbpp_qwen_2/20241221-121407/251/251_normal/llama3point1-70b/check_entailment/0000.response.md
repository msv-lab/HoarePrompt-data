Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, φ)`. The formula used for `r` (the radius) is `math.hypot(x, y)`, which calculates the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`. The formula for `φ` (the angle) is `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`. This function handles all cases correctly, including when `x` or `y` is zero, as `math.atan2` is designed to handle these edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
