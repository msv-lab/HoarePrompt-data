Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, phi)`. The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radius `r` as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`, which is equivalent to `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`. The function also uses `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle `phi` in radians, which correctly handles the case when `x` is zero. The output hints confirm that the function returns the radius `r` and the angle `phi` as specified in the problem description. Since the code handles all potential cases without missing any, the program is correct.
