Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, phi). The `math.hypot(x, y)` function calculates the Euclidean distance (r) from the origin to the point (x, y), which is equivalent to \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\). The `math.atan2(y, x)` function calculates the angle (phi) in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at each step, supporting the correctness of the function as per the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
