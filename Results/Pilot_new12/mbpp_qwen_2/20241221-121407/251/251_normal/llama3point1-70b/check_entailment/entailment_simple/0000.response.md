Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent rectangular coordinates. It then calculates the polar coordinates using the following steps:

1. It uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to compute the radius `r`, which is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`. This corresponds to \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).
2. It uses `math.atan2(y, x)` to compute the angle `phi` in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`.

The function returns these values as a tuple `(r, phi)`, which matches the requirement of returning both the radius and the angle.

Since the program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates without any additional conditions or constraints beyond those specified in the problem description, the program is correct.
