Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent rectangular coordinates. It calculates the radius `r` as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` using the formula `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, and the angle `phi` as the arctangent of `y/x` in radians using `math.atan2(y, x)`. 

- The use of `math.hypot(x, y)` ensures that `r` is computed accurately as the Euclidean distance.
- The use of `math.atan2(y, x)` correctly handles all quadrants and the case when `x` is zero, providing the correct angle `phi` in radians.

Given these points, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and performs the necessary calculations without any apparent issues or missing functionalities. Therefore, the program is correct.
