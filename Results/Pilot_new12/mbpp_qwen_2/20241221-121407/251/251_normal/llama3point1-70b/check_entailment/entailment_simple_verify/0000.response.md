Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, φ)`. The use of `math.hypot(x, y)` for calculating `r` ensures that the radius is computed as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`. Similarly, `math.atan2(y, x)` is used to compute the angle `φ` in radians, which correctly accounts for the quadrant of the point `(x, y)`. The annotations provided align with this functionality, confirming that the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
