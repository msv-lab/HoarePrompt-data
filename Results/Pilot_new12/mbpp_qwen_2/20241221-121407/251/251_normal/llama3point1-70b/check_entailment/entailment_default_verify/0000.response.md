Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates `(x, y)` to polar coordinates `(r, φ)`. The use of `math.hypot(x, y)` for calculating the radius `r` and `math.atan2(y, x)` for the angle `φ` ensures that the conversion is done correctly, including handling edge cases such as when `x` or `y` is zero. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the radius and angle accurately. Since the input is assumed to be valid, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
