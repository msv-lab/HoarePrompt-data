Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, phi). The `math.hypot(x, y)` function computes the Euclidean norm (r), which is equivalent to \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), and `math.atan2(y, x)` computes the angle phi with respect to the positive x-axis. The annotations confirm that the function handles all standard cases, including when x or y is zero, as `math.atan2` is designed to handle these edge cases properly. Therefore, the function works correctly for all potential cases described by the problem statement.
