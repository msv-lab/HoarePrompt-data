`r` is assigned the value of the hypotenuse calculated using the formula `math.hypot(x, y)`, which computes the Euclidean norm of the vector formed by the coordinates `(x, y)`. The value of `r` is the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the square root of (x^2 + y^2), `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates.**
