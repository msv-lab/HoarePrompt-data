The code `phi = math.atan2(y, x)` calculates the angle phi in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`. The value of `phi` is determined using the arctangent function with two arguments, which takes into account the signs of both `x` and `y` to determine the correct quadrant for the angle.

- `r` remains unchanged as the calculation of `phi` does not affect `r`.
- `x` and `y` remain unchanged as the calculation of `phi` does not modify them.
- `phi` is now assigned the value of the arctangent of `y/x`, taking into account the correct quadrant.

Output State: **`r` is the square root of (x^2 + y^2), `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates, `phi` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y)**
