Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent rectangular coordinates. It calculates the radius `r` as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` using the formula `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`, and the angle `phi` as the arctangent of `y/x` in radians. The function then returns both `r` and `phi`. The function correctly handles the case where `x` is zero, ensuring that the angle `phi` is calculated appropriately using `math.atan2(y, x)`. There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the function based on the provided code, including the correct handling of the `atan2` function to ensure the angle `phi` is calculated properly even when `x` is zero.
