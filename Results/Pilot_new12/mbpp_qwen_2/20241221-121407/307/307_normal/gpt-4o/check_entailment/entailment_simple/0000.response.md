Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that finds the index of the smallest triangular number with \( n \) digits.
   
2. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n)` takes one argument `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer representing the number of digits.

3. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The function iteratively calculates triangular numbers using the formula \( \text{triangular\_number} = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).

4. **Condition Check**: The function checks if the length of the string representation of the current triangular number equals \( n \). If so, it returns the value of \( k \).

5. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues incrementing \( k \) until the condition is met, ensuring that the smallest triangular number with \( n \) digits is found.

6. **Assertions**: The provided assertions verify that the function returns the correct index for triangular numbers with 2, 3, and 4 digits, respectively. These tests confirm that the function works as intended for these specific cases.

Given that the function correctly uses the formula for triangular numbers, iterates through values of \( k \) until it finds the smallest triangular number with \( n \) digits, and handles the assertion tests successfully, the program correctly implements the described functionality. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
