Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the function `func_1` as described in the problem statement. The function aims to find the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `k` is exactly `n`. The code iterates through integers starting from 1, calculates the triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and checks its length. If the length matches `n`, it returns the current value of `k`. The provided assertions (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) confirm that the function works as intended for these specific cases. Since the code handles the problem correctly for the given examples and the logical structure of the loop ensures that it will eventually find the correct `k` or return a value based on the given conditions, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
