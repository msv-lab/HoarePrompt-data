Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through natural numbers `k`, calculates the corresponding triangular number, and checks its digit length until it finds the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The given test cases (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) match the expected results. The annotations confirm that the function correctly identifies the smallest `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `k` is exactly `n`. Since the function handles the problem description accurately and the provided test cases work correctly, the original assessment is valid.
