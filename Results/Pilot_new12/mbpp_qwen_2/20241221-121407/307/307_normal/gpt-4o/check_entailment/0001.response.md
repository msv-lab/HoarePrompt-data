Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates through natural numbers `k`, calculates the corresponding triangular number, and checks its digit length until it finds the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The given test cases (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) match the expected results, and the logic appears to handle the problem description accurately for the given range. Since no specific edge cases or inputs were mentioned in the problem description that the function might fail for, and the provided examples work correctly, the function seems to be correct.
