Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function initializes `k` to 1 and iteratively checks the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2`. When the length of this number matches `n`, the function returns `k`, which is the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The provided test cases in the form of assertions (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) are correct and match the expected results. The annotated version aligns with the original assessment, confirming that the function behaves as intended according to the problem description.
