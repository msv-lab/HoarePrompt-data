Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program seems to work correctly for the given test cases. However, we need to consider edge cases to ensure the program works for every potential input.

The issue arises when `n` is 1. A triangular number with 1 digit is simply the number 1 itself, which is the first triangular number. Therefore, for `n = 1`, the expected output should be `1`. However, the current implementation will return `k = 2` because the loop will increment `k` once before checking the length of the triangular number, leading to an incorrect result.

To fix this, we can add a special case for `n = 1`:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1
```

With this modification, the function will correctly return `1` for `n = 1`.
