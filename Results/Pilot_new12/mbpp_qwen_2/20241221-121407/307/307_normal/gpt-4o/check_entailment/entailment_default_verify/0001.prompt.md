You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates through natural numbers `k`, calculates the corresponding triangular number, and checks its digit length until it finds the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The given test cases (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) match the expected results, and the logic appears to handle the problem description accurately for the given range. Since no specific edge cases or inputs were mentioned in the problem description that the function might fail for, and the provided examples work correctly, the function seems to be correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `k` is exactly `n`. If no such `k` is found within a reasonable range, the function will eventually return 1, 2, or 3 based on specific conditions. The function iterates through integers starting from 1, calculating the triangular number for each and checking its length. If the length matches `n`, it returns the current value of `k`. If no match is found within the loop, the function exits due to the infinite loop being broken by the `return` statement, and it returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on the specific conditions defined in the code.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
