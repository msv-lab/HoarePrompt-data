Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` aims to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, and the code achieves this goal through the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `k` is initialized to 1, representing the first triangular number.
2. **Infinite Loop**: The function enters an infinite loop, incrementing `k` in each iteration and calculating the corresponding triangular number.
3. **Condition Check**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`.
4. **Return Statement**: Once the condition is met, the function immediately returns the current value of `k`, which is the smallest integer such that the triangular number has `n` digits.
5. **Break Condition**: The loop will break as soon as the condition is satisfied, ensuring that the returned value of `k` is indeed the smallest integer meeting the criteria.

The assertions provided (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) also verify that the function works as intended for the given test cases. Given the problem description and the code provided, the function always returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the corresponding triangular number is exactly `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.
