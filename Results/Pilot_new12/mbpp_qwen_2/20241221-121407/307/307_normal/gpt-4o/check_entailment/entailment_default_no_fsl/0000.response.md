Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. It iterates through positive integers `k`, calculates the corresponding triangular number, and checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`. If it finds such a `k`, it immediately returns it. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and the provided test cases confirm its correctness for the given inputs. There are no indications in the output hints or the problem description that suggest any missing edge cases or logical flaws.
