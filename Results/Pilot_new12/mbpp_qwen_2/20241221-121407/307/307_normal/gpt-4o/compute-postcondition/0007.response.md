Let's analyze the given loop and the current state step by step:

1. The loop is `while True`, meaning it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as we do not explicitly break out of it.
2. The loop body is omitted, but based on the conditions provided, we need to determine what needs to change for the loop to proceed.

Given the current state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is 2
- `triangular_number` is 1
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`

For the loop to continue executing, the condition that stops it must not be met. In this case, the loop will continue until the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` becomes equal to `n`.

Since the current length of the string representation of `triangular_number` (which is "1") is not equal to `n`, the loop will continue to execute. Therefore, no adjustments are necessary to the current state for the loop to proceed.

However, to ensure clarity in the format requested, we can state the required conditions:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**
