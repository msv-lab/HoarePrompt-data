The code updates the value of `triangular_number` to `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 3, the new value of `triangular_number` is calculated as `3 * (3 + 1) // 2`, which is `3 * 4 // 2`, resulting in `6`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with the length of its string representation being 1, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6**
