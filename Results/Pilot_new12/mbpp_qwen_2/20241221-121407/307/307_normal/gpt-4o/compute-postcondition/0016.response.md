`k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The values of `n` and `triangular_number` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer with the length of its string representation being 1; `k` is 4; `triangular_number` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with the length of its string representation being 1; `k` is 4; `triangular_number` is 6.**
