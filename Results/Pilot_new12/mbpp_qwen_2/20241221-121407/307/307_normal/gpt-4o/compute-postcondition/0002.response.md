`triangular_number` is assigned the value `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 1, the value of `triangular_number` becomes `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `1 * 2 // 2`, resulting in `1`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1**
