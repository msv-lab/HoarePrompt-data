`k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 2 to 3. The values of `n` and `triangular_number` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer with the length of its string representation being 1, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with the length of its string representation being 1, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3**
