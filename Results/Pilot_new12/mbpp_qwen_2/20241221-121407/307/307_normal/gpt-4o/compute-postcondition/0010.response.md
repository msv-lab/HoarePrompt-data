Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer with the length of its string representation being 1, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` equals `n`, the function returns 2. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (i.e., returns None).***
