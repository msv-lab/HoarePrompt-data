According to the code, the `while True` loop will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of. Since there are no conditions given in the loop that would prevent it from continuing, we can assume that the loop will execute one more time without any adjustments to the current state.

Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer with the length of its string representation being 1, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3**
