Step-by-step reasoning:

1. The given `while` loop is `while True:`. This means the loop will always execute as long as the program logic does not break out of it (e.g., using a `break` statement).
2. There are no conditions in the loop that depend on any variable. Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute at least once without needing any specific conditions to be met.

Given the current state right before the loop:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is 1.

Since the loop is `while True`, no adjustments are needed to the state for the loop to execute at least one more time. The loop will execute regardless of the current values of `n` and `k`.

Therefore, the state remains the same as provided.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is 1**
