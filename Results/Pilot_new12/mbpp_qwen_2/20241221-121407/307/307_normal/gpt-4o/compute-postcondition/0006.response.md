The value of `k` is incremented by 1, so `k` becomes `2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**
