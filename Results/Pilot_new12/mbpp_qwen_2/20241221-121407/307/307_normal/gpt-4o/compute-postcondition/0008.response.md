The code `triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2` calculates the triangular number for `k`. Given that `k` is 2, the calculation is `2 * (2 + 1) // 2`, which equals 3. So, `triangular_number` is updated to 3.

The initial state was:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is 2
- `triangular_number` is 1
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`

After executing the code, the updated state is:
- `n` remains a positive integer
- `k` remains 2
- `triangular_number` is now 3
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` (which is now 3) is 1, so this condition changes to `n` is a positive integer such that the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer with the length of its string representation being 1, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3**
