#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `k` is equal to `n`, and `triangular_number` is the triangular number corresponding to `k`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number corresponding to `k` is exactly `n`. If no such `k` is found within a reasonable range, the function will eventually return 1, 2, or 3 based on specific conditions. The function iterates through integers starting from 1, calculating the triangular number for each and checking its length. If the length matches `n`, it returns the current value of `k`. If no match is found within the loop, the function exits due to the infinite loop being broken by the `return` statement, and it returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on the specific conditions defined in the code.
