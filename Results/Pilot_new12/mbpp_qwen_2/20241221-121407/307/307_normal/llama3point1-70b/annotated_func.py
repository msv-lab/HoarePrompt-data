#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `idx` is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is greater than or equal to `n`, and `triangular_num` is the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such `idx` is found within a reasonable range (which in practice is not limited due to the infinite loop), the function will eventually return when the condition is met. The function does not have any edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is designed to handle the case where `n` is very large, as it will continue to increment `idx` until the condition is satisfied.
