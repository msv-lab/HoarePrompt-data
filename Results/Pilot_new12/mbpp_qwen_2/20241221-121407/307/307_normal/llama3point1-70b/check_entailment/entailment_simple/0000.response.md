Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the logic required to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Initialization**: The variable `idx` is initialized to 1, which is the starting point for generating triangular numbers.

2. **Infinite Loop**: The `while True` loop continues indefinitely until a condition is met.

3. **Triangular Number Calculation**: Inside the loop, the triangular number is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. This is the standard formula for the nth triangular number.

4. **Condition Check**: The program checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number (`len(str(triangular_num))`) is greater than or equal to `n`. 

5. **Return Statement**: If the condition is met, the function returns the current value of `idx`, which represents the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

6. **Incrementation**: If the condition is not met, `idx` is incremented by 1 and the loop continues.

7. **Post-Loop State**: After the loop terminates, `idx` will be the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The program correctly handles the problem statement by:
- Generating triangular numbers sequentially.
- Checking each triangular number to see if it meets the digit requirement.
- Returning the index as soon as the condition is satisfied.

Since the program follows the logic specified in the problem description and meets all the requirements, the correctness is **True**.
