Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The annotations support this by indicating that once the condition `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:` is met, the function returns the current value of `idx`, which is indeed the smallest index satisfying the condition. The logic and flow of the program are consistent with the problem description, and the annotated version confirms that the program behaves as expected under the given conditions.
