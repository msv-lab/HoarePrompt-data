Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic required to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates through positive integers, calculating the corresponding triangular number, and checks its length. Once the length of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns the current index. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, including large values of `n`. The output hints confirm that the function meets the problem requirements, and there are no apparent edge cases or limitations that would cause the function to fail.
