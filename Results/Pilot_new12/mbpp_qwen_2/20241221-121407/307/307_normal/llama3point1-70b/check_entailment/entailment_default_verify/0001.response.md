Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided program meets the requirements of finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The program uses the correct formula for generating triangular numbers (`idx * (idx + 1) // 2`) and iterates through values of `idx` until it finds the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. The output hints further confirm that the program will continue to increment `idx` until the condition is met, ensuring that the returned index is indeed the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that would invalidate this assessment, and the program handles the problem as specified without any apparent issues. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
