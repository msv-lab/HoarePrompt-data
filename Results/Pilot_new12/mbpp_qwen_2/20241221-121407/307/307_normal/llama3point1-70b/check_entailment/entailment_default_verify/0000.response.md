Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The while loop continues to increment `idx` until the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` is met, ensuring that the returned `idx` corresponds to the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. The output hints also confirm this functionality, stating that the function returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`. Since there are no contradictions between the code, problem description, and output hints, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
