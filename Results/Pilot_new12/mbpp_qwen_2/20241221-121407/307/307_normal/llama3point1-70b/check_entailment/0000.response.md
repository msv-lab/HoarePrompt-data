Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The logic is sound and works for all cases where `n` is a positive integer. Here's why:

1. The formula for the triangular number is \( T_k = \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \).
2. We iterate over `idx` starting from 1 until we find a triangular number with at least `n` digits.
3. The condition `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:` ensures that the triangular number has the required number of digits.
4. Once the condition is met, the function returns the current value of `idx`.

Since the function handles all cases correctly and the logic is sound, it meets the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
