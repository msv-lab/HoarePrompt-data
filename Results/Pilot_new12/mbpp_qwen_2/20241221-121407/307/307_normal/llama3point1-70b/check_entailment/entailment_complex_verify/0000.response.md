Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The logic is sound, and the annotations confirm that the function iterates until it finds the smallest `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is greater than or equal to `n`. The function handles all valid cases as described in the problem statement and the annotations. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
