Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature and Input Validation**: 
   - The function `func_1(n)` takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer. The problem description assumes that the input will be valid, and no error handling for invalid inputs (like non-integer or negative values) is required under these assumptions.

2. **Triangular Number Calculation**:
   - The function calculates triangular numbers using the formula \( \text{triangular\_num} = \frac{\text{idx} \times (\text{idx} + 1)}{2} \). This correctly computes the \( \text{idx} \)-th triangular number.

3. **Condition Check and Return**:
   - The function uses a while loop to keep incrementing `idx` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number is at least `n`.
   - Once the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` is satisfied, the function returns `idx`.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - The problem description states that the function will continue to increment `idx` until the condition is met. There are no specific edge cases mentioned, and the function is designed to handle the scenario where `n` is very large. Since the loop is an infinite loop that increments `idx` and checks the condition, it will eventually return the correct value.

5. **Program State After Execution**:
   - After the loop, the variable `idx` will be the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of the corresponding triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`. This matches the problem description.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
