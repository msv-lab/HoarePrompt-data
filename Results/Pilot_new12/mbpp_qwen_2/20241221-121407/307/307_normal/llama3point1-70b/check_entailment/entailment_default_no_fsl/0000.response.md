Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. It uses an infinite loop to incrementally check each triangular number until it finds one that has `n` digits or more. The triangular number is calculated using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, and the length of its string representation is checked against `n`. Since the loop continues until the condition is met, and there are no limitations on the value of `n`, the function will always find and return the correct `idx` for any valid positive integer `n`. Therefore, the code satisfies the problem description for every potential case.
