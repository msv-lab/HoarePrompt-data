Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated code and the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The loop continues incrementing `idx` until the length of the string representation of the triangular number (`triangular_num`) is at least `n`. The annotations clearly show that once the condition `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` is met, the function returns the correct index `idx`. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
