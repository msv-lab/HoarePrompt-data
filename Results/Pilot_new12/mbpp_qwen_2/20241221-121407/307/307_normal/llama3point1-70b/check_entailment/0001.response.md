Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. A triangular number is defined as the sum of the natural numbers up to a certain point, and the formula used `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is correct for generating these numbers. The loop continues until the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`, which ensures that the returned index corresponds to the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. Since the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement without any issues, it is correct.
