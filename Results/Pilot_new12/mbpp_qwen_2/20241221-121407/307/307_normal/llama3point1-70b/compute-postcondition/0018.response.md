The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. The function returns one of the following:

- Case_1: An index `idx` that is 1.
- Case_2: An index `idx`, where `triangular_num` is equal to `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
- Case_3: An index `idx` such that `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2` and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return an index `idx` under specific conditions related to triangular numbers and their string representation length.
