`idx` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `idx` is `1 + 1 = 2`. The values of `n`, `triangular_num`, and the length condition remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
