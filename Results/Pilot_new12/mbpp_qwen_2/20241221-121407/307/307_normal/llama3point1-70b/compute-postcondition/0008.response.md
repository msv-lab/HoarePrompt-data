The given code snippet calculates the triangular number for a given index `idx`. However, there is no explicit assignment to a variable in the snippet provided. Instead, it appears to be a calculation. Given the initial state, let's assume `idx` is a previously defined variable. The code `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2` computes the triangular number for `idx` and assigns it to `triangular_num`.

Since there is no prior value specified for `idx`, and the calculation is done within the snippet, we need to consider the impact on the variable `triangular_num`. After executing this line of code, `triangular_num` will hold the value computed from the formula.

Therefore, the output state will be:

Output State: **`triangular_num` is idx * (idx + 1) // 2**
