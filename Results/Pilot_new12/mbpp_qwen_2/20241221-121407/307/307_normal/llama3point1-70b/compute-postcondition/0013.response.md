The code assigns the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` to `triangular_num`. This means that `triangular_num` now holds the value of the triangular number corresponding to `idx`. The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is calculated and compared to `n`, but since no direct comparison or condition is given, we only update the value of `triangular_num`.

Given the initial state that `triangular_num` must be such that the length of its string representation is less than `n`, after executing the line `triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, this condition is satisfied because the value of `triangular_num` is updated based on `idx`, but the specific value of `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`triangular_num` is the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`; the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
