Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute unless explicitly broken out of. This condition does not depend on any variables, but rather a constant condition.

2. **Current State at End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `triangular_num` is `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
   - If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `idx + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the function returns `None`.

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute again as long as the function does not return from within the loop. 
   - There is no condition in the loop body that would prevent the loop from continuing, except for the function returning a value.

Given this information, we need to ensure that the function does not return within the current iteration, meaning the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` should still be less than `n`.

4. **Adjust the State**:
   - To ensure the loop continues, `triangular_num`'s string representation length must still be less than `n`.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `triangular_num` must be such that the length of its string representation is less than `n`.

**Final Answer**:
State: **`triangular_num` must be such that the length of its string representation is less than `n`**
