The code `idx += 1` increments the value of `idx` by 1. The initial state is that `triangular_num` is given by the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, and the function returns `idx` if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, otherwise it returns `None`. After incrementing `idx` by 1, the value of `idx` changes, but the condition checking and return logic remain the same.

Output State: **`triangular_num` is idx * (idx + 1) // 2, if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `idx + 1`, otherwise it returns None**
