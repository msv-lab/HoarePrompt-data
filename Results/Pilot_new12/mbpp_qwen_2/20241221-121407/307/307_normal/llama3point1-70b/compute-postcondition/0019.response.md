Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is greater than or equal to `n`. If no such `idx` is found within a reasonable range (which in practice is not limited due to the infinite loop), the function will eventually return when the condition is met. The function does not have any edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but it is designed to handle the case where `n` is very large, as it will continue to increment `idx` until the condition is satisfied.**

**The function performs the following actions:**
1. Initializes `idx` to 1.
2. Enters a loop that continues indefinitely.
3. Calculates the triangular number `triangular_num` using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`.
4. Checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`.
5. If the condition is met, returns `idx`.
6. Otherwise, increments `idx` and repeats the process.

**Final state of the program after conclusion:**
- The function returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the length of the string representation of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` is greater than or equal to `n`.
