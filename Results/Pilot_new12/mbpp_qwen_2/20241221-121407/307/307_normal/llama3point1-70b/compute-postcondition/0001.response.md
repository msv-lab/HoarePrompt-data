Step-by-step analysis:

1. The given `while` loop is a `while True` loop. This means the loop will always execute at least once, as there is no condition checking termination.

2. Since the loop is guaranteed to execute at least one time, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to proceed to its first iteration.

Therefore, the program state right before the loop does not need any modifications to allow the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 1**
