The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The initial state is such that `triangular_num` is calculated as `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, and if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `idx`. Since there is no return value in the given code snippet, the function does not return anything and the condition for returning is not checked.

Output State: **`triangular_num` is the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`; if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater or equal to `n`, the function returns `idx`; `idx` is increased by 1**
