Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `idx` is 2.
   - `triangular_num` is 1.
   - The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop is `while True`, which means the loop will always execute as long as the loop body doesn't explicitly change the condition to exit.

3. **Determining Next Iteration**:
   - Since the loop is `while True`, no specific conditions need to be checked to continue the loop. The loop will always execute again unless there is an explicit exit condition in the loop body, which is not provided here.

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - Given that the loop will always execute another iteration regardless of the current states of the variables (since it is a `while True` loop), we don't need to adjust any of the states from the previous iteration.

Therefore, the states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**State:**
**`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
