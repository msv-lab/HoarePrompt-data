Postcondition: ***`triangular_num` is the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`; if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater or equal to `n`, the function returns `idx`. There is no return value if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.***
