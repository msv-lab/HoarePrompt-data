The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks whether all elements at even indices are odd. If any element at an even index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements at even indices, the function returns `True`. The function returns `False` in several scenarios, including when it encounters an even number at an even index before completing the iteration over the list. The function also returns `False` if the list has fewer than two elements, as the loop will not run in such a case.
