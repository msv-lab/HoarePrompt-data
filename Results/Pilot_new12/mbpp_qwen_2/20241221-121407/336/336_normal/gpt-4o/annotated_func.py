#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(lst)` if the loop does not execute, and the loop executes until `i` reaches `len(lst)` and returns False if any element at an even index is even.
    return True
    #The program returns True if all elements at even indices in the list `lst` are odd, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks whether all elements at even indices are odd. If any element at an even index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements at even indices, the function returns `True`. The function returns `False` in several scenarios, including when it encounters an even number at an even index before completing the iteration over the list. The function also returns `False` if the list has fewer than two elements, as the loop will not run in such a case.
