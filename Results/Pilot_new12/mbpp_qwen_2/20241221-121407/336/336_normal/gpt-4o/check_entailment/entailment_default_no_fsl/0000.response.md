Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether all elements at even indices are odd, which does not match the problem description. The problem description states that the function should check whether all elements at odd indices are odd. However, the code iterates over elements at even indices (i.e., indices 1, 3, 5, etc.) instead of odd indices (i.e., indices 1, 3, 5, etc.). This means the code is not handling the required logic and will fail for any input where the condition at odd indices needs to be checked. For example, for the list `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`, the code would incorrectly return `True` because it checks the even indices, whereas the correct output should be `False` because the number at index 3 (which is odd) is 3, but the number at index 5 (which is also odd) is 7.
