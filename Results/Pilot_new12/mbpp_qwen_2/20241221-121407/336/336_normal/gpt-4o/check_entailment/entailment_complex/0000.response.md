Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates through the list starting from the second element (index 1) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Problem Description**: Check whether every odd index contains odd numbers in the given list.
2. **Function Implementation**: 
   - The loop starts from index 1 (the first odd index) and increments by 2, ensuring that only elements at odd indices are checked.
   - For each element at an odd index, it checks if the element is even using `if lst[i] % 2 == 0`.
   - If an even number is found at an odd index, it returns `False` immediately.
   - If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

Given the provided assertions:
- `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: All odd-indexed elements (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- `func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: Only one odd-indexed element (1) is present and it is odd.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: The element at the first odd index (1) is 2, which is even.

The function handles all these cases correctly, adhering to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
