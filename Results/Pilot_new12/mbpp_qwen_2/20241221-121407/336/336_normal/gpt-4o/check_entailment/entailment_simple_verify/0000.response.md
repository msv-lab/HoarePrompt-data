Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The annotations in the code further confirm this behavior:

- Before the function call, `lst` is a list of integers.
- During the for loop, the variable `i` is incremented by 2 starting from 1, ensuring that only odd indices are checked.
- If any element at an odd index is even, the function immediately returns `False`.
- After the for loop, if no even numbers are found at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases also validate this behavior correctly:
- `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]` returns `True` because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- `[4, 1, 2]` returns `False` because the element at index 1 (which is 1) is odd, but the element at index 3 is not relevant.
- `[1, 2, 3]` returns `False` because the element at index 1 (which is 2) is even.

Since the function behaves as expected for the provided examples and there are no apparent edge cases that the function fails to handle, the correctness of the program remains **True**.
