Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number. However, the provided function actually checks even indices instead of odd indices. This can be seen from the range specified in the loop: `for i in range(1, len(lst), 2)` starts from index 1 and increments by 2, which effectively checks even indices. The output hints also confirm this misunderstanding, stating that the function checks elements at even indices.

Given the problem description requires checking odd indices, the current implementation is incorrect. Therefore, the final assessment is **False**.
