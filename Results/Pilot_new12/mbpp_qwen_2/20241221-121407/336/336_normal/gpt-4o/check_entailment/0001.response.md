Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. Let's verify this:

- For the list `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`, the function correctly returns `True` because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd (1, 3, 7, 3).
- For the list `[4, 1, 2]`, the function correctly returns `True` because the element at the odd index (1) is odd (1).
- For the list `[1, 2, 3]`, the function correctly returns `False` because the element at the odd index (1) is not odd (2).

The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the second element) and checks if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is even, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

Given these observations, the function appears to correctly implement the required functionality for all tested cases and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, the program is correct.
