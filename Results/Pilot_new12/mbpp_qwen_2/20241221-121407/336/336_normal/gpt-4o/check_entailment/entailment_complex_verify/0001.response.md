Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is based on the assumption that the function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number, but the annotated version clarifies that the function actually checks whether every even index contains an odd number. According to the annotated version, the function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the second element) and checks if each element at an even index is odd. However, the problem description asks for checking whether every odd index contains an odd number. 

Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description, leading to a final assessment of **False**.
