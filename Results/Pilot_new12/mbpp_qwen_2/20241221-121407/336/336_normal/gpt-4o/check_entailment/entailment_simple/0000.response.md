Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) with a step of 2. This ensures that only odd indices are checked.
2. **Condition Check**: For each element at an odd index, the program checks if the element is even using `if lst[i] % 2 == 0`. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`.
3. **Return Statement**: If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

The test cases provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3])` returns `True` because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- `func_1([4, 1, 2])` returns `True` because the element at index 1 is odd.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `False` because the element at index 1 is even.

Since the program meets the requirement specified in the problem description for all possible valid inputs, the correctness of the program is **True**.
