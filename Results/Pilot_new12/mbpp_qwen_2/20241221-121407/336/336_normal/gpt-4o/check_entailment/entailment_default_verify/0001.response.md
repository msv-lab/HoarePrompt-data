Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` is intended to check whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. However, the output hints indicate that the function actually checks for even indices, which is contradictory to the problem description. The function should start iterating from index 1 (the second element, which is at an odd index in zero-based indexing) and check if each element at an odd index is odd. Instead, the function starts from index 1 and checks if each element at an even index is odd, which is why the original assessment is not accurate. This misalignment between the intended functionality and the actual implementation leads to the program being incorrect.
