You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and checks if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases also validate this behavior correctly:
- `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]` should return `True` because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- `[4, 1, 2]` should return `False` because the element at index 1 (which is 1) is odd, but the element at index 3 (which is out of bounds in this case, so it should not affect the result as the function should only check up to the last odd index) is not relevant.
- `[1, 2, 3]` should return `False` because the element at index 1 (which is 2) is even.

Since the function behaves as expected for the provided examples and there are no apparent edge cases that the function fails to handle, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and checks whether all elements at even indices are odd. If any element at an even index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even elements at even indices, the function returns `True`. The function returns `False` in several scenarios, including when it encounters an even number at an even index before completing the iteration over the list. The function also returns `False` if the list has fewer than two elements, as the loop will not run in such a case.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
