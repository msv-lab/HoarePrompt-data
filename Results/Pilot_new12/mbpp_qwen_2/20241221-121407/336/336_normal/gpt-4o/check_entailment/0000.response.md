Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and checks if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

The provided test cases also validate this behavior correctly:
- `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]` should return `True` because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
- `[4, 1, 2]` should return `False` because the element at index 1 (which is 1) is odd, but the element at index 3 (which is out of bounds in this case, so it should not affect the result as the function should only check up to the last odd index) is not relevant.
- `[1, 2, 3]` should return `False` because the element at index 1 (which is 2) is even.

Since the function behaves as expected for the provided examples and there are no apparent edge cases that the function fails to handle, the correctness of the program is **True**.
