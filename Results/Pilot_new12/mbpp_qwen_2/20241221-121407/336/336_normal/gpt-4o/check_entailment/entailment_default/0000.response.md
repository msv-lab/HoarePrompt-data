Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. However, the problem description asks for checking whether every odd index contains an odd number, not an even index. The code iterates over the list starting from index 1 (odd indices) and checks if the numbers at these indices are odd. This means the code is checking the wrong indices according to the problem description.

To fix this, the code should start the loop from index 0 (even indices) and check if the numbers at these indices are even. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(0, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

This corrected version starts from index 0 and checks if the numbers at even indices are even, which aligns with the problem description.
