Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **Initial State**: 
  - `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
  - `i` is 3.
  - The element at index `i` (which is `lst[3]`) is either an odd number (the function returns False) or the element at index `i` does not exist (the function returns False due to the condition failing).

### Loop Condition:
- The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to the length of `lst` with a step of 2. This means `i` takes on the values 1, 3, 5, ..., up to the largest odd number less than or equal to the length of `lst`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `i` is 3.
- The element at index 3 (which is `lst[3]`) is either an odd number or does not exist.

### Next Iteration:
- For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 2 from its current value.
- Therefore, `i` will be 5 in the next iteration.

### Adjusting the State:
- Since `i` is now 5, we need to check if `lst[5]` exists and if it is an odd number.
- The state should reflect that `i` is now 5 and the condition for the next iteration needs to be checked.

### Updated State:
- `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
- `i` is now 5.
- The element at index 5 (which is `lst[5]`) is either an odd number (the function returns False) or the element at index 5 does not exist (the function returns False due to the condition failing).

### Final Answer:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 5, and the element at index 5 (which is `lst[5]`) is either an odd number (the function returns False) or the element at index 5 does not exist (the function returns False due to the condition failing).**
