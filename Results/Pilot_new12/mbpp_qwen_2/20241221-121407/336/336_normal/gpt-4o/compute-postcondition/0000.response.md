Let's break down the given for loop and determine the necessary states for the loop to execute:

Given:
- The initial state: `lst` is a list of integers.
- The for loop: `for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):`

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Range**: The loop iterates over indices starting from 1 (inclusive) up to `len(lst)` (exclusive) with a step of 2. This means the loop will only execute if there are at least two elements in the list (since the step size is 2).

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `lst` must have at least two elements. Otherwise, the range function will not generate any valid indices.

3. **First Iteration**:
   - On the first iteration, `i` should be set to 1 because the loop starts at 1 and increments by 2 each time.

4. **Subsequent Iterations**:
   - Each subsequent iteration will increment `i` by 2. Therefore, the next possible values for `i` would be 3, 5, etc., depending on the length of the list.

### Adjusted States:

To ensure the loop can execute at least once:
- `lst` must have at least two elements.
- `i` must be initialized to 1 for the first iteration.

Therefore, the required states to be adjusted are:
- `lst` must have at least two elements.
- `i` must be 1.

### Final Answer:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, `i` is 1**
