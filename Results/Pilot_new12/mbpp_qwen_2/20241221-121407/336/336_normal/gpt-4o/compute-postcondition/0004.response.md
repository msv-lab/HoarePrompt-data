Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
   - `i` is 1.
   - The element at index `i` (which is `lst[1]`) is an odd number.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs with `i` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 each time, up to but not including `len(lst)`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1, meaning the loop body was executed for `i = 1`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` needs to be incremented by 2.
   - Therefore, `i` will become `1 + 2 = 3`.

5. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will continue if `i` is less than `len(lst)`.
   - Given that `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2, the next value of `i` is 3.
   - Thus, `3` must be less than `len(lst)` for the loop to continue.

6. **Element Check**:
   - In the next iteration, the element at index `i` (which is now `lst[3]`) needs to be an odd number.

7. **Updated States**:
   - `lst` remains the same as it is a list with at least two elements.
   - `i` becomes 3.
   - The element at index `i` (`lst[3]`) must be an odd number.

Based on these steps, the updated states for the next iteration of the loop are:

**State: `lst` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is 3, and the element at index `i` (which is `lst[3]`) is an odd number**.
