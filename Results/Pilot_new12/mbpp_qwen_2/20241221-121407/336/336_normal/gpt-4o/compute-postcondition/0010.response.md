Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(lst)` if the loop does not execute, and the loop executes until `i` reaches `len(lst)` and returns False if any element at an even index is even.**

### Explanation:
- **Loop Condition:** The loop runs for indices starting from 1 up to `len(lst)-1` with a step of 2. This means it checks every other element starting from the first element (index 1).
- **Return Condition:** The loop checks if the element at the current index `i` (where `i` starts at 1 and increments by 2) is even. If any such element is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`.
- **End Condition:** If the loop completes without finding any even number at the specified indices, it means all elements checked were odd. However, since the loop only checks elements at even indices (starting from 1), it would have returned `False` if any such element was even. Therefore, if the loop completes, it implies no even numbers were found at the even indices checked.
- **Final State:** 
  - If the loop does not execute (i.e., `len(lst)` is less than 2), both `lst` and `i` retain their original values.
  - If the loop executes, `i` will be `len(lst)` (since the loop increments by 2 until it reaches the last valid index).

Given this understanding, the final state of the variables is as described above.
