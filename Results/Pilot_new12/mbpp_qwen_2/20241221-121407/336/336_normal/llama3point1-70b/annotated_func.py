#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is `len(lst) - 1`, and the function returns `True` if no element at an odd index is even, otherwise the function returns `False`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It iterates through the list, checking if any integer at an odd index is even. If such an integer is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no even integer is found at an odd index, the function returns `True`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.
