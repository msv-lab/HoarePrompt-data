Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description**: Check whether every odd index contains odd numbers in the given list.
2. **Program Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input.
   - It iterates through the list using a for loop with the index `i`.
   - For each element at an odd index (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`), it checks if the element is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
   - If any element at an odd index is even, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

This logic ensures that the function correctly checks each odd-indexed element and returns the appropriate boolean value based on whether all odd-indexed elements are odd. Thus, the program always does what the problem description asks for.
