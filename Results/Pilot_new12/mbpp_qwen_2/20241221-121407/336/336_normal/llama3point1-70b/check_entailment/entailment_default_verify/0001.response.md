Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The provided output hints confirm that the function iterates through the list, ensuring that only even indices are checked for even values, while odd indices are implicitly checked for odd values due to the condition `i % 2 != 0`. If any even value is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such a case, the function returns `True`. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, and there is no indication from the output hints that the program behaves incorrectly or misses any cases. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
