Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in the list contains an odd number. The annotations support this:

1. Before the function call, `lst` is assumed to be a list of integers.
2. The for loop iterates over the list indices. The condition `i % 2 != 0` checks if the index is odd, and `lst[i] % 2 == 0` checks if the value at that index is even. If any odd index contains an even number, the function immediately returns `False`.
3. If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

The annotations correctly describe the state of the program, and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
