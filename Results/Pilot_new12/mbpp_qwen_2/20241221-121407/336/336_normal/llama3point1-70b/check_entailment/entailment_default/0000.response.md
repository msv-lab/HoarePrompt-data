Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks if every odd index in the given list `lst` contains an odd number. If any even number is found at an odd index, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to handle all potential cases correctly. The function iterates through the list and checks each element at an odd index to ensure it is odd. The condition `i % 2 != 0` ensures that only odd indices are checked, and `lst[i] % 2 == 0` checks if the number at that index is even. If any even number is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers, it returns `True`.

Since the code meets the requirements for every potential case, the correctness is **True**.
