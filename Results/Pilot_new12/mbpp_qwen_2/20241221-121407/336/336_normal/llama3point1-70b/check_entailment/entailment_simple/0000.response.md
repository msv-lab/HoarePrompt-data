Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Loop through the list**: The `for` loop iterates over each index `i` of the list `lst`.
2. **Check conditions**: For each odd index (`i % 2 != 0`), it checks whether the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
3. **Return immediately on failure**: If an odd-indexed element is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. **Return `True` if all checks pass**: If the loop completes without finding any odd-indexed even numbers, the function returns `True`.

This ensures that the function correctly verifies whether every odd index contains an odd number in the list. The program adheres to the problem description and handles all relevant cases as required.
