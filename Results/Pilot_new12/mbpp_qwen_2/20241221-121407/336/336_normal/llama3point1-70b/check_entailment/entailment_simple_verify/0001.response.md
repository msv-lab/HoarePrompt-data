Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index in the list contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list using a for loop and checks the condition `i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0` to ensure that only elements at odd indices are checked for being even. If any even value is found at an odd index, the function returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such a case, the function returns `True`. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, ensuring that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
