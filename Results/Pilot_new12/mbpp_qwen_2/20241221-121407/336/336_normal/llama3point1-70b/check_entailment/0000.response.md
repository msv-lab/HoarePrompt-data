Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. Let's verify this by considering different scenarios:

1. An empty list: For an empty list, the function will return `True` because there are no odd indices to check.
2. A list with only one element: Since the only index is 0 (even), the condition `i % 2 != 0` will never be true, so the function will return `True`.
3. A list with multiple elements: The function iterates through the list and checks if the value at each odd index is odd. If any value at an odd index is even, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

Given these scenarios, the function correctly identifies whether every odd index contains an odd number. There is no potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.
