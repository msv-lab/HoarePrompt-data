Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number. The function iterates through the list and ensures that only even indices are checked for even values, while odd indices are implicitly checked for odd values due to the condition `i % 2 != 0`. If any even value is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding such a case, the function returns `True`. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, covering all potential cases without missing any. The annotated version provides clear evidence that the function behaves as intended, making the original assessment correct.
