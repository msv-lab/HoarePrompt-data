Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The original assessment is accurate because the function iterates through the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an even number at an odd index. If no such even number is found, it returns `True`. This matches the problem description perfectly. The output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, iterating through the list and checking the condition at odd indices without modifying the input list. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
