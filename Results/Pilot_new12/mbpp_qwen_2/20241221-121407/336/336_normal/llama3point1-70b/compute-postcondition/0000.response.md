State before the loop starts: `lst` is a list of integers.
```
for i in range(len(lst)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop will start with `i = 0`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as `i < len(lst)`.
3. **Initial State of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0.
4. **Condition Check**: For the loop to execute at least once, `len(lst)` must be greater than 0 (i.e., `lst` must contain at least one element).

Based on this analysis, we need to adjust the initial state to include:
- `i` being set to 0.
- `len(lst)` being greater than 0.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:
State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `i` is 0, and `len(lst)` must be greater than 0**
