Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It iterates through the list, checking if any integer at an odd index is even. If such an integer is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If no even integer is found at an odd index, the function returns `True`. The function does not modify the input list `lst`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the list is empty, the function will return `True` because there are no odd indices to check.
- If the list contains only one element (which is at an odd index), the function will return `False` if that element is even, and `True` if it is odd.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The provided return postconditions mention "Case_1: The program returns False", "Case_2: The program returns False", "Case_3: The program returns False", and "Case_4: The program returns True". However, these postconditions are not explicitly stated in the annotations within the code itself. The function always checks for the condition where an even number is found at an odd index, and returns `False` in such cases. If no such condition is met, it returns `True`. Thus, the provided postconditions seem to be covering all possible outcomes based on the logic of the function.
