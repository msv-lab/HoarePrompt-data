Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function `func_1` generates a sequence of even numbers from 2 to `2 * n - 2` using the `range` function with a step of 2. It then computes the cube of each number in this sequence and sums them up using the `sum` function. The output hints confirm that the function returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `2 * n`. Since the function works correctly for any valid positive integer `n`, and no edge cases are explicitly handled but are not necessary for the problem, the code meets the problem description for every potential case.
