Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The annotations confirm that the function generates a sequence of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `2 * n`, computes the cube of each number in the sequence, and then sums these cubes. Since the function works as intended for all valid positive integer inputs `n`, the original assessment is accurate.
