Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's break down the logic:

- The function uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` which generates the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.
- `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` starts from 2 and increments by 2 until it reaches `2n`, ensuring only even numbers are considered.
- The `sum()` function then adds up these cubes.

For example:
- If `n = 1`, the even numbers are `[2]`, and the cube sum is `2^3 = 8`.
- If `n = 2`, the even numbers are `[2, 4]`, and the cube sum is `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`.

Since the function correctly implements the logic for finding the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers, it works for all potential cases within the described problem. Therefore, the program is correct.
