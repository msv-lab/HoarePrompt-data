Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The annotated version clarifies that `n` is a positive integer, which aligns with the problem description. The generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` generates the cubes of the first `n` even numbers, and `sum()` correctly computes their total sum. Since the annotated version supports the correctness of the function, the original assessment remains valid.
