Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. It uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to compute the cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `2 * n`. The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates even numbers in the required range. Given this, the code works for every potential case as described in the problem statement and the output hints. There are no edge cases or specific examples mentioned that would cause the program to fail.
