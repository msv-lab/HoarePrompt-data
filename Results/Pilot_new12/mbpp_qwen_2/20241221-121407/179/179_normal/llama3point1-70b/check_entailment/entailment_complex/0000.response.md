Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the task described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. Hereâ€™s why:

- The function takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer.
- The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates a sequence of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `2 * n`. For example, if `n = 3`, the range will generate the numbers `[2, 4, 6]`.
- The expression `i ** 3` computes the cube of each even number in the sequence.
- The `sum()` function adds up all these cubes.
- The function does not explicitly handle edge cases like non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, but given the problem constraints, we assume the input will always be a valid positive integer.

Thus, the function accurately performs the required operation as per the problem description.
