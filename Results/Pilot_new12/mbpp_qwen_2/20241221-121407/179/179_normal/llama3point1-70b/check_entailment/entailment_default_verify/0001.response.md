Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided program and problem description. The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The range `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` ensures that the loop iterates over even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `2 * n`, and the generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` correctly computes the cubes of these even numbers. The `sum()` function then adds these cubes together, producing the desired result. The output hints also confirm this understanding, stating that the function correctly processes the given range for any valid positive integer `n`. Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment remains accurate.
