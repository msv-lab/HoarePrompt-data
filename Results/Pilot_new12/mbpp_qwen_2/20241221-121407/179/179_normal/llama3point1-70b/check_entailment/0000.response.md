Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's verify this with a few examples:

- For `n = 1`, the first even natural number is 2. The cube sum is \(2^3 = 8\).
- For `n = 2`, the first two even natural numbers are 2 and 4. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
- For `n = 3`, the first three even natural numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).

The program uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to compute the cube of each even number from 2 up to `2n` (inclusive). This approach is both efficient and correct according to the problem description. Therefore, the program works for all potential cases.
