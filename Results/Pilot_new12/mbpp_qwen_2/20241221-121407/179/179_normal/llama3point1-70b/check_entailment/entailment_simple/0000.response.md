Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(n)` aims to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's break down the program to understand how it achieves this:

- **Function Definition**: `def func_1(n):` defines a function that takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer.
- **Comprehension and Range**:
  - `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates a sequence of even numbers starting from 2 up to (but not including) `2 * n`.
  - For example, if `n = 3`, the sequence generated would be `[2, 4, 6]`.
- **Cubing and Summing**:
  - `i ** 3` computes the cube of each even number in the sequence.
  - `sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` sums these cubed values.
  - Continuing with the example above, the function would compute \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3\).

Given that the program correctly implements the logic of finding the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, it adheres to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
