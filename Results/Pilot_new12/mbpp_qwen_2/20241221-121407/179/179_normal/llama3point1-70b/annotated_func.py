#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
    #The program returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including 2 * n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including 2 * n. The function generates a sequence of even numbers from 2 to 2 * n - 2 (since the range function stops before the end value), computes the cube of each number in the sequence, and then sums these cubes. This process covers all positive integer inputs for `n`. No edge cases are explicitly handled in the code, but the function correctly processes the given range for any valid positive integer `n`.
