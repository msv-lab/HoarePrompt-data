Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The annotations provide a clear explanation of how the function operates, and the assertions given in the code confirm that the function works as expected for the provided test cases. The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer, and while it doesn't explicitly handle non-positive integers, the original assessment is based on the assumption that the input will be valid, which aligns with the provided annotated version. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
