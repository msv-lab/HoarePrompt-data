Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature and Purpose**: The function `func_1` is defined to accept a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer. The purpose of the function is to calculate the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

2. **Generating Even Numbers**: The line `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]` correctly generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example, if `n = 3`, the list would be `[2, 4, 6]`.

3. **Calculating Cube Sum**: The line `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` correctly computes the sum of the cubes of these even numbers. For instance, if `even_numbers = [2, 4, 6]`, the cubes are `[8, 64, 216]`, and their sum is `288`.

4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns the computed `cube_sum`, which matches the expected output as per the problem description.

5. **Mathematical Formula**: The provided mathematical formula \(2n^2(n+1)^2\) is indeed the correct formula for the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function correctly implements this formula through its logic.

Given the problem description and the provided assertions, the function `func_1` accurately performs the required operation for any positive integer input `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.
