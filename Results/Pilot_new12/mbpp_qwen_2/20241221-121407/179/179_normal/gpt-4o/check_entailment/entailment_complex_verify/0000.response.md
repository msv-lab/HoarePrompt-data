Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The annotated code confirms that the function generates a list of the first `n` even numbers, computes the cube of each number, sums these cubes, and returns the result. The provided assertions (`assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, `assert func_1(4) == 800`) also validate the correctness of the function for the given test cases. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
