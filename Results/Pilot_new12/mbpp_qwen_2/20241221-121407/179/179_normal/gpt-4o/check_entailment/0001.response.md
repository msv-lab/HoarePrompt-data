Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The assertions provided in the code also pass:

- For `n = 2`, the even numbers are `[2, 4]` and their cubes sum to `8 + 64 = 72`.
- For `n = 3`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6]` and their cubes sum to `8 + 64 + 216 = 288`.
- For `n = 4`, the even numbers are `[2, 4, 6, 8]` and their cubes sum to `8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`.

The function generates the first `n` even numbers using a list comprehension and then computes the sum of their cubes. Since the function and the assertions seem to cover the basic cases correctly, and no other edge cases (such as `n = 0`, `n = 1`, or negative values of `n`) were specified, we can conclude that the function works as intended for the given problem description.
