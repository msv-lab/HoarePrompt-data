Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function generates a list of the first `n` even numbers using a list comprehension, computes the cube of each number, sums these cubes, and returns the result. The assertions provided in the problem description confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases:

- For `n = 2`, the first two even numbers are 2 and 4. Their cubes are 8 and 64, respectively. The sum is \(8 + 64 = 72\).
- For `n = 3`, the first three even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. Their cubes are 8, 64, and 216, respectively. The sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
- For `n = 4`, the first four even numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8. Their cubes are 8, 64, 216, and 512, respectively. The sum is \(8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\).

Since the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description for the given test cases and the output hints align with the code, the function is correct for every potential case within the scope provided.
