Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It generates the first `n` even natural numbers, computes the cube of each number, and then sums these cubes. The assertions provided in the code also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs (2, 3, and 4). Since the code handles all tested cases and the problem description aligns with the implementation, the program is correct for every potential case under the assumption of valid input.
