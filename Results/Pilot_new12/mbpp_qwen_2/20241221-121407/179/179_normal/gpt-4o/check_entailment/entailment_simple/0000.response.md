Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes that the input will be a positive integer, and the program does not explicitly validate the input. However, the assertions provided in the annotated program (e.g., `assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, `assert func_1(4) == 800`) implicitly test that the function works correctly for these cases. Since the problem description does not require explicit validation for non-positive integers, and we are assuming valid input, the program is considered correct.

2. **Even Natural Numbers Calculation**: The program generates the first `n` even natural numbers using the list comprehension `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This correctly generates the sequence `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2n]`.

3. **Cube Sum Calculation**: The program calculates the cube sum of these even numbers using another list comprehension `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`. This correctly computes the sum of cubes of the even numbers generated in the previous step.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated cube sum, which is the desired output.

Given that the program correctly implements the required functionality and the assumptions about valid input hold true, the program is correct according to the problem description.
