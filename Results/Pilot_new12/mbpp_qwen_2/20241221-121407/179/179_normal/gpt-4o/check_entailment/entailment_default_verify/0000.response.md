Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The output hints also confirm that the function generates the first `n` even numbers, computes their cubes, and sums them up. The provided assertions for `func_1(2)`, `func_1(3)`, and `func_1(4)` further validate the correctness of the function. There are no indications from the output hints or the code itself that suggest any errors or issues with the program's implementation.
