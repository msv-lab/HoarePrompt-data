Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. Let's verify this by analyzing the function:

1. It generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers using the expression `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
2. It computes the cube sum of these numbers using the generator expression `(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` and the `sum` function.
3. The assertions provided (`assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, `assert func_1(4) == 800`) confirm the correctness of the function for the given test cases.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function appears to be correct and handles the specified cases accurately. There are no apparent issues or edge cases that would make the program incorrect based on the information provided.
