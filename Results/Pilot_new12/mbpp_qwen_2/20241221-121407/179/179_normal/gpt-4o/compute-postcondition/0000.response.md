The code creates a list `even_numbers` containing even numbers from 2 up to 2 * n. Specifically, it uses a list comprehension to generate this list. For each integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive), it calculates `2 * i` and adds this value to the list. Therefore, the list `even_numbers` will contain the even numbers 2, 4, 6, ..., 2 * n.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `even_numbers` is a list containing the even numbers 2, 4, 6, ..., 2 * n.**
