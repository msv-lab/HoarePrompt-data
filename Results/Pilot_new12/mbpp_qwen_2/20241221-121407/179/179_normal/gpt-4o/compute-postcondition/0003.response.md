The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns `cube_sum`, which is calculated as `2n^2(n+1)^2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the value of `cube_sum` calculated as `2n^2(n+1)^2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, returns `cube_sum` calculated as `2n^2(n+1)^2`.**
