The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even numbers. Specifically, it generates a list of the first `n` even numbers (i.e., 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n), computes the cube of each number in this list, sums these cubes, and returns the resulting sum. The returned value is mathematically equivalent to \(2n^2(n+1)^2\). The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer and will raise an error or produce unexpected results if `n` is not a positive integer.
