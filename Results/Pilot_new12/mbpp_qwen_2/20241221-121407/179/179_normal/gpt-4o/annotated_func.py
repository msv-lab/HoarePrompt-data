#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum which is 2n^2(n+1)^2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even numbers. Specifically, it generates a list of the first `n` even numbers (i.e., 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n), computes the cube of each number in this list, sums these cubes, and returns the resulting sum. The returned value is mathematically equivalent to \(2n^2(n+1)^2\). The function handles the case where `n` is a positive integer and will raise an error or produce unexpected results if `n` is not a positive integer.
