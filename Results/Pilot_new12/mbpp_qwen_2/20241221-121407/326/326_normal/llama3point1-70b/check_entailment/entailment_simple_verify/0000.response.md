Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The code first sorts the array, ensuring that the smallest differences will be between adjacent elements. Then, it iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between consecutive elements and updating the minimum difference found. The annotated version confirms that the function correctly processes the array and updates the minimum difference accordingly. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
