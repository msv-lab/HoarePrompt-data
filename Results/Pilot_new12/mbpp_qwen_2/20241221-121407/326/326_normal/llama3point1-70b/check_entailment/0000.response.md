Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first sorts the array, which ensures that the smallest differences will be adjacent to each other. Then, it iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between consecutive elements and keeping track of the minimum difference found. This approach guarantees that the function will find the correct minimum difference for any given array. Since the function handles all potential cases correctly and the logic is sound, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
