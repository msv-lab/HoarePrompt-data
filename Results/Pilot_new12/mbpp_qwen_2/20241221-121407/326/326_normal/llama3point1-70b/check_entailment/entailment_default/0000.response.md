Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array by first sorting the array and then iterating through it to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. The code handles the case where the array has fewer than two elements by returning `float('inf')`. Given the problem description and the provided output hints, the code works correctly for every potential case.
