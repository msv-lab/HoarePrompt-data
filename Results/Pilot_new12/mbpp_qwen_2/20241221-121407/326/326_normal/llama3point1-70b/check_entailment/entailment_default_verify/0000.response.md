Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function takes a list of integers and finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the list. The provided output hints confirm that the function sorts the list and iterates through it to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. If the list contains fewer than two elements, the function correctly returns `float('inf')`, indicating that no differences can be computed. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
