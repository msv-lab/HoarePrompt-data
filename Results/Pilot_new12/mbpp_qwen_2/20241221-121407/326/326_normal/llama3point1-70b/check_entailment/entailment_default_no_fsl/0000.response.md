Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not actually depend on the `target` parameter, which is mentioned in the problem description but not used in the function. The function should ignore the `target` parameter and only focus on finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. Since the `target` parameter is unused and the function name `func_1` suggests it might be related to the target value, this indicates a potential misunderstanding of the problem description. The function should be simplified to:

```python
def find_min_difference(arr):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    if len(arr) < 2:
        return float('inf')
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

This corrected version ensures that the function focuses solely on the array and finds the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements after sorting the array.
