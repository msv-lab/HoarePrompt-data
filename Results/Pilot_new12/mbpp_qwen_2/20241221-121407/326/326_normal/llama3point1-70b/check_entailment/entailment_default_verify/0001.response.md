Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first sorts the array, ensuring that the smallest differences are between consecutive elements. It then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements and updating the minimum difference accordingly. The function handles the case where the array has fewer than two elements by returning `float('inf')`, as no differences can be computed. The output hints align with the functionality described in the problem description and the original assessment, confirming that the program meets the requirements.
