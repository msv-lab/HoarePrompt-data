Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the function works for all potential cases:

1. The function first sorts the array, which ensures that any consecutive elements in the sorted array will have the smallest possible differences.
2. It initializes `min_diff` to infinity (`float('inf')`), which allows the first comparison to set the initial value correctly.
3. It iterates through the sorted array and calculates the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements.
4. It updates `min_diff` whenever it finds a smaller difference.

Given these steps, the function will correctly compute the minimum difference for any input array. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as the input is a valid list of numbers. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for all potential cases.
