Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the smallest difference between consecutive elements in `arr` seen so far, `i` is 0, `diff` is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`. If the condition `diff < min_diff` is true, `min_diff` is updated to `diff`. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains unchanged.***
