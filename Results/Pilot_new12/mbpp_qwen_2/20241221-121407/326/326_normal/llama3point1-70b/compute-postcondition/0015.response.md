Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `i` is the last index processed (if the loop executes), `diff` is the absolute difference between the current element and the next element in `arr` (if the loop executes). If the loop does not execute, `min_diff` remains positive infinity.**
