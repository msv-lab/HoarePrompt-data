The code assigns the value of the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` to `diff`. Given that `i` is 1, this means `diff` is assigned the value of `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the smallest difference between consecutive elements in `arr` seen so far, `i` is 1, `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`.**
