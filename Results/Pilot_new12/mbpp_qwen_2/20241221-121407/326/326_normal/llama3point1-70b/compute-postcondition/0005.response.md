The code `min_diff = diff` assigns the current value of `diff` to `min_diff`. Given that `diff` is currently the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr` and that this value is lower than `min_diff`, `min_diff` will now hold the same value as `diff`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the current value of `diff`, `i` is 0, `diff` is abs(`arr[0]` - `arr[1]`)**
