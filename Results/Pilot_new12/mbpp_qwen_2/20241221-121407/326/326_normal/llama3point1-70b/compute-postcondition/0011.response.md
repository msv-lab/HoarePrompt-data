Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
   - `target` is an integer (not relevant for the loop).
   - `min_diff` is the smallest difference between consecutive elements in `arr` seen so far.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `len(arr) - 2`.

3. **State Adjustments Needed for Next Iteration:**
   - Since `i` starts at 1, the next value of `i` would be 2.
   - The loop body calculates `diff` as `abs(arr[i] - arr[i+1])`, so for the next iteration, `diff` would be `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`.

4. **Checking `min_diff`:**
   - The loop updates `min_diff` if `diff < min_diff`.
   - Since `i` is increasing by 1 each iteration, we need to check if `i` is within the valid range (`0` to `len(arr) - 2`).

5. **Final State for Next Iteration:**
   - `arr` remains unchanged.
   - `target` remains unchanged.
   - `min_diff` remains unchanged unless it is updated in the loop body.
   - `i` becomes 2.
   - `diff` is now `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the smallest difference between consecutive elements in `arr` seen so far, `i` is 2, `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`**.
