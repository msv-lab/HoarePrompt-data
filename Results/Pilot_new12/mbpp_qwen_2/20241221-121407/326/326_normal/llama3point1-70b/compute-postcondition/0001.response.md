The code initializes `min_diff` to `float('inf')`. This sets `min_diff` to positive infinity, which is used later to find the minimum difference between elements in the array and the target value. The initial state of `arr` being a sorted list of integers and `target` being an integer remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers; `target` is an integer; `min_diff` is positive infinity**
