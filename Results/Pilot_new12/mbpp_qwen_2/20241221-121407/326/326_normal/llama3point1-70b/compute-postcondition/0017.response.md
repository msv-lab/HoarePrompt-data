The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `target`, which is an integer. After executing the function body, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and return the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.**
