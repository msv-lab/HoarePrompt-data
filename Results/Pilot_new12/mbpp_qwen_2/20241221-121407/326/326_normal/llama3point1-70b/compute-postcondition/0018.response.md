Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It first sorts the list `arr`. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. The function returns this smallest difference. If the list `arr` has fewer than two elements, the function returns `float('inf')` because no differences can be computed.**

This summary covers the actual behavior of the code, including the sorting of the list and the computation of the smallest difference between consecutive elements. It also includes an edge case where the list has fewer than two elements, ensuring the function returns a meaningful value.
