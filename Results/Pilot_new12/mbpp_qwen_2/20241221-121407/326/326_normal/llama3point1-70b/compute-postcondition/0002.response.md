According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `arr`. The loop iterates from `i` = 0 to `len(arr) - 2`, meaning that the loop requires at least two elements in the list to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `min_diff` is positive infinity.

For the loop to execute, the list `arr` must contain at least two elements. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0**
