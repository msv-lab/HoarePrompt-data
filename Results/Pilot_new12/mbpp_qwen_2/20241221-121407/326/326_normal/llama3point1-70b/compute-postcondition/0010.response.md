Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the smallest difference between consecutive elements in `arr` seen so far, `i` is 1, `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. If `diff < min_diff`, `min_diff` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `min_diff` is updated to `diff`.***
