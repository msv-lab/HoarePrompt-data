The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It first sorts the list `arr`. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. The function returns this smallest difference. If the list `arr` has fewer than two elements, the function returns `float('inf')` because no differences can be computed.
