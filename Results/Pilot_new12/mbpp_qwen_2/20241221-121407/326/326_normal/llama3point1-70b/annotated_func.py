#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`, `i` is the last index processed (if the loop executes), `diff` is the absolute difference between the current element and the next element in `arr` (if the loop executes). If the loop does not execute, `min_diff` remains positive infinity.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It first sorts the list `arr`. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. The function returns this smallest difference. If the list `arr` has fewer than two elements, the function returns `float('inf')` because no differences can be computed.
