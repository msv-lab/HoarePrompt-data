Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `diff` is `arr[n - 1] - arr[n - 2]`, and `min_diff` is `arr[n - 1] - arr[n - 2]`. If `diff < min_diff`, no change occurs. Otherwise, no additional information is provided regarding changes to `arr`, `n`, `i`, `diff`, or `min_diff`.***
