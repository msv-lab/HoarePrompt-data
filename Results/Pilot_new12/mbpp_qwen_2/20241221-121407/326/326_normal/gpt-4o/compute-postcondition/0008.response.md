The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. Since `diff` is the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]` where `diff < min_diff` is true, the value of `min_diff` is updated to this specific `diff`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 2, `min_diff` is the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]` (where `diff < min_diff` was true), `diff` is the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`**
