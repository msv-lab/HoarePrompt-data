`min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. The value of `diff` is `arr[n - 1] - arr[n - 2]`, which means `min_diff` is also `arr[n - 1] - arr[n - 2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `diff` is `arr[n - 1] - arr[n - 2]`, `min_diff` is `arr[n - 1] - arr[n - 2]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `diff` is `arr[n - 1] - arr[n - 2]`, `min_diff` is `arr[n - 1] - arr[n - 2]`**
