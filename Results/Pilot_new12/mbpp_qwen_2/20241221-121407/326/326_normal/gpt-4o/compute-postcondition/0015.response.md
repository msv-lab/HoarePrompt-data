The code calculates the difference between the element at index `i + 1` and the element at index `i` in the list `arr`. Since `i` is `n - 2`, the indices involved are `n - 1` and `n - 2`. The value of `diff` is the difference between the element at index `n - 1` and the element at index `n - 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n - 2`, `diff` is `arr[n - 1] - arr[n - 2]`**
