Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers, and `n`, an integer representing the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2. The function first checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or more, the function sorts the list `arr`. It then iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements and stores this value in `min_diff`. Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference found.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is 2, the function still sorts the list and calculates the difference between the two elements, returning the smallest difference.
- If `arr` contains duplicate elements, the function will correctly identify the smallest difference between these elements.
- If `arr` is already sorted, the function will still sort it again, but this does not affect the outcome since sorting a list that is already sorted results in the same list.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The code assumes that `n` is always greater than or equal to 2. There is no check to handle the case where `n` is less than 2, which is already handled by returning 0. However, the function does not explicitly mention this edge case in its postconditions.
