The code snippet `diff = arr[i + 1] - arr[i]` calculates the difference between two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`. This value is stored in the variable `diff`. The other variables `arr`, `n`, and `min_diff` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Since `arr` is a sorted list, `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]` are consecutive elements, and their difference `diff` is calculated. However, without knowing the specific values of `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`, we can only say that `diff` is the difference between these two elements. The minimum difference `min_diff` remains unchanged as it was set to infinity initially and is not modified by this line of code. Variable `n` is also not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 2, `min_diff` is infinity, `diff` is the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`**
