According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n - 2`, meaning `n` must be at least 2 to ensure there are at least two elements in the list for the loop to iterate over.

Given the current state where `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is an integer such that `n >= 2`, and `min_diff` is infinity, we need to ensure that the loop can indeed execute by adjusting the state appropriately.

Here are the steps:

1. `arr` is a sorted list of integers: This is already given and ensures that the list is properly ordered.
2. `n` is an integer such that `n >= 2`: This condition is necessary for the loop to execute, as `n - 1` must be a positive integer.
3. `min_diff` is infinity: This value is irrelevant to the loop execution but should remain as provided.

Since `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state to reflect this requirement.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 2, `min_diff` is infinity**
