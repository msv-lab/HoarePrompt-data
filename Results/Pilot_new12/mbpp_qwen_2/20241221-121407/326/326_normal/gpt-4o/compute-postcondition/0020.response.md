The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers, and `n`, which is an integer representing the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

The function has two return cases:
- Case_1: The function returns 0.
- Case_2: The function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n` representing its length, and return either 0 or the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.
