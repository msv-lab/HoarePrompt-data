The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. This means that `min_diff` is now updated to the current value of `diff`, which is the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers, the values of `arr`, `n`, and `min_diff` (prior to the assignment) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 2, `min_diff` is the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`, `diff` is the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`**
