Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a function `func_1` that correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first checks if the length of the array `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in such cases. For arrays with at least two elements, the function sorts the array and then iterates through it to find the smallest difference between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem. The provided assertions also validate the function's correctness across different scenarios.
