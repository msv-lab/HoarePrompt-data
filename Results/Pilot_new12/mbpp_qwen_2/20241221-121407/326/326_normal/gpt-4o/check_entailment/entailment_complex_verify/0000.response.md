Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets the requirements of the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` properly handles the input conditions, sorts the array if necessary, and finds the minimum difference between consecutive elements. The test cases provided also validate the function's correctness. Since the annotated version aligns with the original assessment and provides additional confirmation of the program's behavior, the original assessment remains accurate.
