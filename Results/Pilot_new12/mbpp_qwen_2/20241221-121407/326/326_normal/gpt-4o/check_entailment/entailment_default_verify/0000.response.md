Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. It first checks if the array size `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in such a case. Then, it sorts the array and iterates through it to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements. The provided test cases confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. The output hints also align with the functionality of the program, indicating that it handles the specified cases appropriately. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
