Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides clear insights into the state of the program at different stages, confirming that the function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

- The function first checks if the array size `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in such a case, which aligns with the problem description.
- After sorting the array, the function iterates through it to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements.
- The annotated states describe the program's progression accurately, showing that the function handles the input array correctly and returns the expected minimum difference.

Given the problem description and the annotated version, the program is indeed correct.
