Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The annotated version confirms that the function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2 and returns 0 in that case. If `n` is 2 or more, it sorts the array and iterates through adjacent elements to find the smallest difference, which it then returns. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
