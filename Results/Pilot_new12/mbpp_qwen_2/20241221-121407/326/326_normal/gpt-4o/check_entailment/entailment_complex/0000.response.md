Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr` (a list of integers) and `n` (an integer representing the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2). This matches the problem description.

2. **Edge Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the edge case where `n < 2`. In this scenario, it returns 0, which is consistent with the problem description that states the function should find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array, and returning 0 makes sense if there are fewer than two elements.

3. **Sorting and Finding Minimum Difference**: The function sorts the array and then iterates through it to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the smallest possible difference is found, which aligns with the problem description.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference found between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list. This also matches the problem description.

Since the program correctly implements all aspects of the problem description and handles all relevant cases, the program is correct.
