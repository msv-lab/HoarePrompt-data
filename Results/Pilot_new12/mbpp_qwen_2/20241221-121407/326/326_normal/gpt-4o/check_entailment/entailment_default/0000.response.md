Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and its length `n`, and it aims to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. The code first checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or more, it sorts the array and then iterates through the sorted array to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements.

Given the assertions provided:

1. `func_1((1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25), 6)` returns 1.
2. `func_1((4, 3, 2, 6), 4)` returns 1.
3. `func_1((30, 5, 20, 9), 4)` returns 4.

These examples confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases. The output hints also align with the code, indicating that it sorts the array and finds the minimum difference between consecutive elements. There are no potential edge cases or inputs mentioned in the hints or the problem description that the code fails to handle. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
