Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. It first checks if the array size `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in such a case. Then, it sorts the array and iterates through it to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements. This approach ensures that the smallest possible difference is found. The given test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for the provided inputs. Therefore, the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
