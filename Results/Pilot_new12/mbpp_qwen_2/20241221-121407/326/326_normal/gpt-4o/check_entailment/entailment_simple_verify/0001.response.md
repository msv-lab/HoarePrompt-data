Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in such cases. For valid inputs where `n >= 2`, it sorts the array and iterates through adjacent elements to find the smallest difference. The provided test cases in the annotated version also confirm the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
