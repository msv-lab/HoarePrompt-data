Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0 since there would be no valid pairs. It then sorts the array and iterates through adjacent elements to find the smallest difference. This approach ensures that the function works for any given array and number of elements, as demonstrated by the provided test cases. There doesn't appear to be any edge case or potential scenario that this function does not handle correctly.
