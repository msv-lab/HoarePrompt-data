Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided test cases and the output hints confirm that the function works as expected. The function handles the edge case where `n` is less than 2 by returning 0, and it sorts the array to ensure that it correctly identifies the smallest difference between consecutive elements. The provided code and the problem description align perfectly, and there are no discrepancies that would lead to a different assessment.
