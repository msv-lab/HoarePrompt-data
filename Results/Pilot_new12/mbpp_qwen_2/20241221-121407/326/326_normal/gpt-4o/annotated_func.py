#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and n is an integer representing the length of the list such that n >= 2.
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0

            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `n >= 2`, `min_diff` is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers, and `n`, an integer representing the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2. The function first checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or more, the function sorts the list `arr`. It then iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements and stores this value in `min_diff`. Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference found.
