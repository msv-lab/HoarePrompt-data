The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers, and `n`, an integer representing the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2. The function first checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or more, the function sorts the list `arr`. It then iterates through the sorted list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements and stores this value in `min_diff`. Finally, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the smallest difference found.
