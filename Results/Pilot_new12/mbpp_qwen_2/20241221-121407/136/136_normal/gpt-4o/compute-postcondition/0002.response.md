Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` with comparable values and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This means that all key-value pairs in the returned dictionary satisfy the condition `value >= n`. Potential edge cases include when `d` is empty or when all values in `d` are less than `n`, in which case the returned dictionary would be empty. There is no missing functionality as the code correctly implements the described behavior.**
