Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The function has been tested with three assertions that cover different scenarios:

1. When `n` is 170, the output includes entries with values 175, 180, and 190.
2. When `n` is 180, the output includes entries with values 180 and 190.
3. When `n` is 190, the output includes only the entry with value 190.

These test cases cover various values of `n`, and the function behaves as expected in each case. Since no specific edge cases or additional potential cases were identified that the code does not handle correctly, we can conclude that the function is correct according to the problem description.
