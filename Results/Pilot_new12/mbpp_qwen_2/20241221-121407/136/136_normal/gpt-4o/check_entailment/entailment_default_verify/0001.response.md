Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, returning a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value satisfies the condition `value >= n`. The provided assertions cover various scenarios and validate the function's behavior. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the output hints that suggest the function is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of Correctness: True is justified.
