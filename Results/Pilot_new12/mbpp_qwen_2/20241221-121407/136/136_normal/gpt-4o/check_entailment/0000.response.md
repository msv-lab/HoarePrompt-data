Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with key-value pairs that satisfy the condition `v >= n`, which aligns with the problem description. All the provided assertions pass, and there doesn't seem to be any edge case that this function would fail for. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for every potential case.
