Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The annotated version of the code clarifies that the function returns a dictionary where each key-value pair is from the original dictionary `d` and the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The three assertions provided in the annotated version cover different scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
