Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The annotated version clearly describes the state of the program and the behavior of the function, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with key-value pairs that satisfy the condition `v >= n`. All provided assertions pass, and there are no edge cases mentioned that the function would fail for. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for every potential case as stated in the original assessment.
