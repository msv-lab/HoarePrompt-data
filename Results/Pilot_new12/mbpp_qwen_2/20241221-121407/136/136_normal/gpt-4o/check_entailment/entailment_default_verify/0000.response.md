Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The provided output hints further confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The code handles potential edge cases such as an empty dictionary or when all values are less than `n` by returning an empty dictionary. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained.
