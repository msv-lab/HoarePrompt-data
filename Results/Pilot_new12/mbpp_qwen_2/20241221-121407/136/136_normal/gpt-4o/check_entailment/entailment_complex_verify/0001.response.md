Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The annotated version clearly explains the behavior of the function and the state of the program before and after the function call. The provided assertions cover different scenarios and confirm that the function behaves as expected. There are no edge cases or potential issues mentioned in the annotations that indicate the function is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
