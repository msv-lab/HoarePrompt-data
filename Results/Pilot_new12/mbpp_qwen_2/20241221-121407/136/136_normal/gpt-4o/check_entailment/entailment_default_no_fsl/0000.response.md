Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1` according to the problem description. It filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The assertions provided cover various cases, including the edge case where the dictionary is empty or all values are less than `n`, resulting in an empty dictionary. Since the code handles these cases correctly and the provided examples work as expected, the program is correct for every potential case.
