Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The given test cases confirm that the function works as expected for the provided inputs. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code's implementation, indicating that the function correctly filters the dictionary based on the specified condition. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that would cause the function to fail for any valid input.
