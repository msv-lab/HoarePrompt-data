Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`. This matches the problem description.

2. **Logic**: The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the dictionary `d` to only include key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This logic correctly implements the filtering process as described in the problem statement.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program test various scenarios:
   - When `n` is 170, the function should return a dictionary containing entries with values greater than or equal to 170.
   - When `n` is 180, the function should return a dictionary containing entries with values greater than or equal to 180.
   - When `n` is 190, the function should return a dictionary containing entries with values greater than or equal to 190.

4. **Output**: For all tested cases, the function returns the expected output as verified by the assertions.

Since the function logic aligns with the problem description and passes the provided test cases, the program is correct.
