Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The annotated version confirms that the function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with key-value pairs that satisfy the condition `v >= n`. The provided test cases pass, and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
