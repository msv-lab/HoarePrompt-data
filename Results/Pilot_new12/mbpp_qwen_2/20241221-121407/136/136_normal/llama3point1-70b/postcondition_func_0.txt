The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`, with those values unchanged. This means that for every key in the original dictionary `d`, if its value is less than `n`, that key-value pair will not be present in the returned dictionary. If the original dictionary `d` is empty or contains no values greater than or equal to `n`, the returned dictionary will also be empty. No modifications are made to the original dictionary `d`.
