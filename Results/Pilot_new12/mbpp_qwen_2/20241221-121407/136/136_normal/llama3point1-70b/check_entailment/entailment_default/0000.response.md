Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The code uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This approach works for every potential case:

- If the dictionary `d` is empty or contains no values greater than or equal to `n`, the returned dictionary will be empty.
- For each key in the original dictionary `d`, if its value is less than `n`, that key-value pair will not be included in the returned dictionary.
- The code does not modify the original dictionary `d`, which is consistent with the problem description.

Since the code meets the requirements for every potential case and the output hints confirm the behavior of the code, the program is correct.
