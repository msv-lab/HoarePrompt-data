Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs. It then uses a dictionary comprehension to create and return a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This exactly matches the requirement specified in the problem description, which asks for a function that filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases of valid input.
