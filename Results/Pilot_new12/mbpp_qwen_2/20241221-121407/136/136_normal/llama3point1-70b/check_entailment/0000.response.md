Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value meets the condition. This implementation handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and works correctly for any dictionary and integer `n`.
