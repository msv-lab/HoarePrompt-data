Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the value meets the condition. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support this, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
