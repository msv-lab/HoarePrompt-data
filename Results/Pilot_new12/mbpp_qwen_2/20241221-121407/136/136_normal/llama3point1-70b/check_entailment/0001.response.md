Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to filter a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This logic covers all potential cases where the values in the dictionary meet the specified condition. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
