Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. The code uses a dictionary comprehension to create this new dictionary, which is consistent with the problem description. The code handles all potential cases as described in the output hints, including the case where the original dictionary is empty or contains no values greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
