Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. This matches the requirement exactly. The comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` ensures that only those key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n` are included in the returned dictionary. If the original dictionary `d` is empty or contains no values greater than or equal to `n`, the returned dictionary will indeed be empty, as specified in the problem description. Thus, the program always does what the problem description asks for.
