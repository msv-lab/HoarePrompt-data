Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The annotation states that the function returns a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of keys from dictionary `d` that have corresponding values greater than or equal to `n`, with those values unchanged. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the function to filter the dictionary based on the specified condition. Therefore, there is no need to change the original assessment.
