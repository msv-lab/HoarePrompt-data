You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where the values are integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of keys from dictionary 'd' that have corresponding values greater than or equal to 'n', with those values unchanged
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`, with those values unchanged. This means that for every key in the original dictionary `d`, if its value is less than `n`, that key-value pair will not be present in the returned dictionary. If the original dictionary `d` is empty or contains no values greater than or equal to `n`, the returned dictionary will also be empty. No modifications are made to the original dictionary `d`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
