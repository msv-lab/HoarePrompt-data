Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to filter out key-value pairs from the input dictionary `d` where the values are less than `n`, returning a new dictionary that only includes key-value pairs where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. This aligns with the problem description and the provided output hints, which state that the function should return a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. The function does not modify the original dictionary, and handles cases where the dictionary is empty or contains no values greater than or equal to `n` appropriately by returning an empty dictionary. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
