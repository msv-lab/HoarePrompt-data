Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The annotations support this by explaining that the function returns a dictionary with only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the values meet the specified condition. The annotated version clarifies that the function does not modify the original dictionary and correctly handles cases where the original dictionary is empty or contains no values greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
