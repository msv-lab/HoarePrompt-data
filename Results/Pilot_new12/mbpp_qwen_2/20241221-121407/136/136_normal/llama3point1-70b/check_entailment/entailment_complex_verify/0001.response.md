Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to filter a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The annotated version confirms that the function creates a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`, with those values unchanged. This behavior aligns perfectly with the problem description, and there are no issues or edge cases identified in the annotated version that would invalidate the original assessment.
