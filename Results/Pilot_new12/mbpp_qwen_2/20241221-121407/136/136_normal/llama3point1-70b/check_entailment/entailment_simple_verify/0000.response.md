Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The annotation clearly states that the program returns a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of keys from dictionary `d` that have corresponding values greater than or equal to `n`, with those values unchanged. This aligns perfectly with the problem description and the original assessment. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
