Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`, with those values unchanged. This means that for every key in the original dictionary `d`, if its value is less than `n`, that key-value pair will not be present in the returned dictionary. If the original dictionary `d` is empty or contains no values greater than or equal to `n`, the returned dictionary will also be empty. No modifications are made to the original dictionary `d`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the dictionary `d` is empty, the function returns an empty dictionary.
- If all values in `d` are less than `n`, the function also returns an empty dictionary.
- If `n` is very large (e.g., larger than all values in `d`), the function still correctly returns an empty dictionary.
