The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `d`, which is a dictionary where the values are integers, and `n`, which is an integer. The function returns a new dictionary where each key-value pair consists of keys from dictionary `d` that have corresponding values greater than or equal to `n`, with those values unchanged.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`. It returns a dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`.**
