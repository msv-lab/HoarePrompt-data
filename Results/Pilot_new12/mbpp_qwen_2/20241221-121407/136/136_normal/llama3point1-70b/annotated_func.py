#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where the values are integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary where each key-value pair consists of keys from dictionary 'd' that have corresponding values greater than or equal to 'n', with those values unchanged
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`, with those values unchanged. This means that for every key in the original dictionary `d`, if its value is less than `n`, that key-value pair will not be present in the returned dictionary. If the original dictionary `d` is empty or contains no values greater than or equal to `n`, the returned dictionary will also be empty. No modifications are made to the original dictionary `d`.
