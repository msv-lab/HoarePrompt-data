Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples (`tuple1` and `tuple2`) as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of performing a logical AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. 

Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program satisfies the problem description:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description does not specify any validation for the inputs, only that they should be tuples of the same length. The provided program does not explicitly validate that the inputs are tuples or that they have the same length. However, since we are assuming valid inputs, this is not a concern.

2. **Logical AND Operation**: The program uses a generator expression inside a tuple comprehension to iterate over pairs of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2` using the `zip` function. For each pair `(a, b)`, it performs the logical AND operation `a & b`. The result of this operation is then included in the resulting tuple.

3. **Result Output**: The final output is a tuple containing the results of the logical AND operations. This matches the expected behavior described in the problem statement.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
