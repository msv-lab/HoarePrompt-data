Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples and returns the results as a new tuple. The provided test cases and the annotated version confirm that the function behaves as intended and produces the correct outputs. The annotations clarify that the function works correctly for tuples of the same length, which is consistent with the problem description. There is no evidence in the annotated version or the original assessment that suggests the function is incorrect. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
