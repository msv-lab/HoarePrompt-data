Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the task is to extract elements from the given two tuples. However, the provided function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples and returns the results as a new tuple. The annotations also confirm this behavior. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description, which requires extracting elements rather than performing bitwise operations. Thus, the original assessment is accurate.
