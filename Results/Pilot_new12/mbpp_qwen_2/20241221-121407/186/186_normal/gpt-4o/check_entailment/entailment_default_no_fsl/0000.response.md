Correctness: False

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem description asks to extract elements from the given two tuples, but the code is actually performing a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the tuples. The code does not extract elements directly, but rather computes the result of a bitwise AND operation. This means that the output of the function does not match the expected output for the given examples. For instance, for the first example `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the expected output would be the elements themselves if the task was simply to extract them, but the code performs a bitwise AND which results in `(0, 0, 2, 1)`. The correct implementation should simply return the input tuples as they are, or possibly return a tuple of the elements themselves without any operations.
