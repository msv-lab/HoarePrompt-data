Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the input tuples. However, the problem description asks to "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples," which typically means returning elements from both tuples rather than their bitwise AND results. The function does not extract elements in the manner described by the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
