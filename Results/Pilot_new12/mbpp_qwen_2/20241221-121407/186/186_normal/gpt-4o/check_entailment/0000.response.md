Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the bitwise AND operation between elements of the two tuples and returns the result as a new tuple. However, the problem description asks to extract elements from the given tuples, which implies returning a tuple containing elements from both tuples, not their bitwise AND results.

For example, the function should return a tuple with elements from both input tuples, such as `(10, 5, 4, 9)` or `(1, 5, 2, 3)`, depending on the interpretation of "extracting elements." Since the function performs a bitwise AND operation instead of extracting elements, it does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
