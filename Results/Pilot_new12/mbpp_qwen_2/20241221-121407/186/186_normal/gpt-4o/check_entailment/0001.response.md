Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a generator expression within a tuple to perform bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples. The function seems to work correctly based on the provided test cases:

1. For the input tuples `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, the output is `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which matches the expected result.
2. For the input tuples `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, the output is `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which also matches the expected result.
3. For the input tuples `(8, 9, 11, 12)` and `(7, 13, 14, 17)`, the output is `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which is correct.

The function handles the problem description correctly by performing the bitwise AND operation on each pair of elements from the input tuples and returning the results as a new tuple. Given that the function passes all the provided test cases and the operation seems to be logically sound, we can conclude that the program is correct.
