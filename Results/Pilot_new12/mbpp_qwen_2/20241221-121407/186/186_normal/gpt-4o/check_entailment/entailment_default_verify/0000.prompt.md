You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
Program:
```
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)

def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the bitwise AND operation between elements of the two tuples and returns the result as a new tuple. However, the problem description asks to extract elements from the given tuples, which implies returning a tuple containing elements from both tuples, not their bitwise AND results.

For example, the function should return a tuple with elements from both input tuples, such as `(10, 5, 4, 9)` or `(1, 5, 2, 3)`, depending on the interpretation of "extracting elements." Since the function performs a bitwise AND operation instead of extracting elements, it does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are both tuples of the same length. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of performing a logical AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This operation is performed using a generator expression within a tuple comprehension, which iterates over pairs of elements from both tuples using the `zip` function. If either element from the pair is `False`, the result for that position in the returned tuple will be `False`; otherwise, it will be `True`. The function handles cases where the input tuples are of equal length, but no explicit handling is provided for when the lengths differ; in such cases, the function will still execute, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
