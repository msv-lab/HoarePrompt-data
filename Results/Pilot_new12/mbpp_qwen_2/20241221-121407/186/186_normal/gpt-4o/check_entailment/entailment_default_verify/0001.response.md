Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of two input tuples and returns the results as a new tuple. The output hints confirm that the function iterates over pairs of elements from both tuples using the `zip` function and applies the bitwise AND operation. The provided test cases match the expected results, indicating that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
