Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` indeed performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two input tuples, rather than extracting elements from them. The problem description asks to extract elements from the given tuples, which typically means returning a tuple containing elements from both tuples, not their bitwise AND results. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns a new tuple where each element is the result of performing a logical AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment of its correctness being False is correct.
