Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` performs the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples and returns the results as a new tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as intended, performing the bitwise AND operation on each pair of elements from the input tuples. Additionally, the function passes all the provided test cases, indicating that it correctly implements the specified functionality. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the annotations.
