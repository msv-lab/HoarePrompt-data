Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of performing a logical AND operation on the corresponding elements from the input tuples. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including cases where the target elements in the tuples match or do not match, and the function handles these cases appropriately. The code uses a generator expression within a tuple comprehension to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples using the `zip` function, which ensures that the function works correctly for tuples of the same length. Given the problem description and the examples provided, the function appears to meet the requirements for every potential case.
