Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description. The problem description states that the function should extract elements and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples, which is not extracting elements or tuples as described. Instead, it returns a new tuple containing the results of the bitwise AND operations between corresponding elements of the input tuples.

To correctly implement the function according to the problem description, the function should return the input tuples themselves without any modifications. Here's how the corrected function would look:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple1, tuple2

# Test cases
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == ((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == ((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == ((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))
```

This corrected function returns the input tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2` as a tuple of tuples, which is consistent with the problem description.
