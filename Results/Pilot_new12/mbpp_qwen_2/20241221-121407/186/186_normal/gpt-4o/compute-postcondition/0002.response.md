Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are both tuples of the same length. It returns a new tuple where each element is the result of performing a logical AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. This operation is performed using a generator expression within a tuple comprehension, which iterates over pairs of elements from both tuples using the `zip` function. If either element from the pair is `False`, the result for that position in the returned tuple will be `False`; otherwise, it will be `True`. The function handles cases where the input tuples are of equal length, but no explicit handling is provided for when the lengths differ; in such cases, the function will still execute, potentially leading to unexpected results or errors.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the input tuples are empty, the function will return an empty tuple.
- If the input tuples have different lengths, the function will still attempt to pair elements from both tuples, which could lead to incorrect results or a runtime error if the tuples are not properly aligned.
