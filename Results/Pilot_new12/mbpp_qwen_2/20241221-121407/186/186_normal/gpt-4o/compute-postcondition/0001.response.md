The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Both `tuple1` and `tuple2` are tuples of the same length. The function returns a tuple containing elements that are the result of the logical AND operation applied to the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters tuple1 and tuple2, both tuples of the same length, and returns a tuple containing the logical AND of corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2.**
