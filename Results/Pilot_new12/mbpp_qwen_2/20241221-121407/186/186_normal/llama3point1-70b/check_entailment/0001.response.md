Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function uses the bitwise AND operator `&` between elements of the two tuples, which is not consistent with the problem description of extracting element-wise and tuples. The problem description suggests that the function should simply combine corresponding elements from both tuples into a new tuple, but the current implementation performs a bitwise operation, which is likely not the intended behavior.

For example, consider the input tuples `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`. The expected output would be `((1, 2), (2, 5), (3, 6))`, but the current implementation will perform bitwise operations, resulting in a tuple of integers instead. This shows that the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
