Final: **False**

Reasoning: Based on the annotated version of the code and the original problem description, the function `func_1` is intended to extract element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the current implementation uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) between the corresponding elements of the two tuples, which does not align with the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that combines corresponding elements from both tuples into a new tuple, but the current implementation performs a bitwise operation, resulting in a tuple of integers rather than a tuple of tuples. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate and the program does not meet the problem description.
