Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to perform the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters `tup1` and `tup2`, which are expected to be tuples containing integers.
2. **Bitwise AND Operation**: The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to iterate over the pairs of elements from `tup1` and `tup2` using `zip`. For each pair `(x, y)`, it computes `x & y`, which performs the bitwise AND operation.
3. **Handling Unequal Lengths**: The use of `zip` ensures that the function processes pairs of elements up to the length of the shorter tuple. If one tuple is longer than the other, the extra elements are simply ignored.
4. **Empty Tuples**: If either `tup1` or `tup2` is empty, the `zip` function will yield no pairs, resulting in an empty tuple being returned by the function.

Given these points, the function `func_1` accurately fulfills the problem description provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
