Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as inputs and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of performing the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. This matches the problem description perfectly.

The `zip` function is used to iterate over pairs of elements from both tuples simultaneously, and the generator expression `tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))` computes the bitwise AND for each pair of elements and collects them into a single tuple. Since the problem description specifies that the function should "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples," this implementation satisfies the requirement by returning a new tuple containing the results of the bitwise AND operations.
