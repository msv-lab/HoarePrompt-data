Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not meet the problem description. The function `func_1` is intended to extract element-wise results of the bitwise AND operation between two tuples. However, the current implementation uses the bitwise AND operator `&` within a generator expression inside a tuple constructor, which is incorrect for obtaining the desired result.

The correct approach would be to use a generator expression to yield the results of the bitwise AND operation and then convert it to a tuple. Hereâ€™s a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This corrected version will work correctly for every potential case where both tuples are of the same length. If the tuples are of different lengths, it will process pairs of elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, which aligns with the output hints provided.

Since the original code does not correctly perform the bitwise AND operation, the provided solution is incorrect. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
