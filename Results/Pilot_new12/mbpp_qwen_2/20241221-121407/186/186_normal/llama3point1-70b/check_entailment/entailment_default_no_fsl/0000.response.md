Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code uses the bitwise AND operator `&` instead of element-wise multiplication, which is not what the problem description asks for. The problem description requires extracting the element-wise product of the two tuples, not their bitwise AND. For example, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`, the correct output should be `(4, 10, 18)` (i.e., \(1*4, 2*5, 3*6\)), but the given code will produce `(0, 0, 2)`, which is the result of applying the bitwise AND operator. Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
