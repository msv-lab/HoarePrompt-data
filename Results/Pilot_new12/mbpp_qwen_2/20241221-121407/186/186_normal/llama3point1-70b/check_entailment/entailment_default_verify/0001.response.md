Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function uses the bitwise AND operator `&` between elements of the two tuples, which is not consistent with the problem description of extracting element-wise and tuples. According to the problem description and the output hints, the function should combine corresponding elements from both tuples into a new tuple of tuples. However, the current implementation performs a bitwise operation, which results in a single tuple of integers rather than a tuple of tuples. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
