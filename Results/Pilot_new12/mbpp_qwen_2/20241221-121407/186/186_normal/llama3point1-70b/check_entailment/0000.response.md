Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses the bitwise AND operator `&` to perform a bitwise operation on the elements of the tuples, which is not what the problem description asks for. The problem description requires extracting elements from the given two tuples, but the program performs a bitwise AND operation instead. For example, if the input tuples are `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`, the program will return `(0, 0, 0)` because `1 & 4 = 0`, `2 & 5 = 0`, and `3 & 6 = 0`. This is not the expected output based on the problem description.

To fix this, the program should simply return the tuples themselves without any operations, as the problem description does not specify any operations to be performed on the elements. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tup1, tup2
```

This version will correctly return the input tuples as specified in the problem description.
