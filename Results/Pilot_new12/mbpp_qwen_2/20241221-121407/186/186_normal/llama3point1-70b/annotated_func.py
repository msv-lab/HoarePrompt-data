#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuples tup1 and tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `tup1` and `tup2`, which are expected to be tuples containing integers. The function returns a new tuple where each element is the result of performing the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. If the tuples are of unequal length, the function will only process pairs of elements up to the length of the shorter tuple. If either tuple is empty, the function returns an empty tuple.
