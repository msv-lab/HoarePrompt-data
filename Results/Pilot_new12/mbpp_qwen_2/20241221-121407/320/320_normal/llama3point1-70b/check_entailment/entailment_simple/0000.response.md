Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. **Handling Duplicates**: 
   - The program first converts the list `nums` to a set using `set(nums)` to remove duplicates, resulting in a list `unique_nums`. This ensures that all elements in `unique_nums` are distinct.
   
2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2, the function returns `None`, which is correct because there would be no second smallest element if there are fewer than two distinct elements.

3. **Returning the Second Smallest Element**:
   - After ensuring that `unique_nums` contains at least two distinct elements, the program sorts `unique_nums` and returns the second element (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`). Since the list is sorted, this gives the second smallest number.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the problem description for all valid inputs, as long as the input list contains at least two distinct integers. Therefore, the program is correct.
