Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided annotated version of the code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list under the assumption that the input list contains at least two distinct elements. 

1. The function converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list (`unique_nums`). This ensures that only unique elements are considered.
2. The if statement checks if there are at least two unique elements in the list. If not, it returns `None`, which is the correct response as per the problem description.
3. If there are at least two unique elements, the function sorts the list and returns the second element, which is the second smallest number.

The annotations in the code support this reasoning, confirming that the function behaves as intended. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as **True**.
