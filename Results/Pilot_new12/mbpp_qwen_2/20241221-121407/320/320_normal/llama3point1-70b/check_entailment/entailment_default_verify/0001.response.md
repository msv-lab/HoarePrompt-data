Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the second smallest number in a list of integers. The output hints confirm that the function handles edge cases appropriately, such as returning `None` when there are fewer than two distinct elements in the list. The function also removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and back to a list, ensuring that only unique numbers are considered. Since the function behaves as expected for all given scenarios, the original assessment of its correctness being `True` is maintained.
