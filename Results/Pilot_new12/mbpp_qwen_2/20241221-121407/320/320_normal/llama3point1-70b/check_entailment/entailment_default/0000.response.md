Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using a set, then sorting the resulting list of unique numbers, and finally returning the second element in the sorted list. This handles all potential cases as described:

- If the list has fewer than two distinct elements, it correctly returns `None`.
- If the list has at least two distinct elements, it correctly returns the second smallest number.

The output hints confirm that the code behaves as expected for all mentioned cases. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case, and Correctness: **True**.
