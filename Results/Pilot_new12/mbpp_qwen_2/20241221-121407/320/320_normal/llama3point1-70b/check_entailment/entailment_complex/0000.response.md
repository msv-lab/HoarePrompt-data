Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the task of finding the second smallest number in a list of integers. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list of integers (`nums`) and ensures that there are at least two distinct elements by converting the list to a set and back to a list. This effectively removes any duplicate elements.
   
2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the resulting list (`unique_nums`) contains fewer than two distinct elements, the function correctly returns `None`. This covers the scenario where all elements in the input list are the same, or there are fewer than two distinct elements.

3. **Finding the Second Smallest Element**: After ensuring there are at least two distinct elements, the function sorts the list of unique numbers and returns the second element in the sorted list, which is the second smallest integer.

Given these points, the program always meets the problem description for every potential valid case. It correctly handles the edge case where the list has fewer than two distinct elements and appropriately finds and returns the second smallest integer when there are at least two distinct elements. Therefore, the program is correct.
