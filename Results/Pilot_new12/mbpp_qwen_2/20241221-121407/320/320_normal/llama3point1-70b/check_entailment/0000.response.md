Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not handle the case where the list contains duplicate elements that are the smallest in the list. For instance, consider the list `[1, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. The second smallest number should be `2`, but the program will return `1` because it first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and then sorting the unique numbers. This approach fails to identify the second distinct smallest number in the presence of duplicates.
