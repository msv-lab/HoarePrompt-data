Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. It first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and back to a list (`unique_nums`).
2. If the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2, it returns `None`, which is appropriate since there cannot be a second smallest number with fewer than 2 unique elements.
3. If there are at least two unique numbers, it sorts them and returns the second element in the sorted list.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:
- If the list has fewer than 2 elements, it returns `None`.
- If there are duplicate elements, they are removed before finding the second smallest.
- If the list contains at least two distinct elements, the function correctly identifies the second smallest number.

Since the function works correctly for all described scenarios, the correctness is `True`.
