The code `unique_nums = list(set(nums))` converts the list `nums` into a set to remove duplicates and then back into a list. Since `nums` initially contains at least two distinct elements, converting it to a set will not change its contents because a set automatically removes duplicates. Therefore, `unique_nums` will contain the same elements as `nums`.

Output State: **`unique_nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.**
