The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two distinct elements. It first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and then back to a list. If the resulting list of unique numbers contains fewer than two elements, the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest integer from the list of unique numbers. Potential edge cases include an input list with less than two distinct elements, in which case the function correctly returns `None`. No missing functionality was observed in the provided code.
