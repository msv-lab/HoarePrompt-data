Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of integers with at least two distinct elements. It first removes duplicate elements by converting the list to a set and then sorts the resulting set of unique elements. If there are at least two unique elements, it returns the second element in the sorted list; otherwise, it returns `None`. This covers the case where `nums` contains fewer than two distinct elements, in which case the function will return `None`.**
