The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements. The function returns the second element in the sorted list of unique elements from `nums` if there are at least two unique elements; otherwise, it returns `None`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `nums` of integers with at least two distinct elements, and return the second element in the sorted list of unique elements from `nums` if there are at least two unique elements; otherwise, it returns `None`.
