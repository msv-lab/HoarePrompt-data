The code `unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))` impacts the program by converting the list `nums` into a set to remove duplicate elements, then sorting the resulting set to create a new list `unique_nums`. Since `nums` contains at least two distinct elements, the set operation removes duplicates, and the sorting operation orders the unique elements.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is a sorted list of the unique elements from `nums`.**
