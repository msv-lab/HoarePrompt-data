#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
    #`The program returns the second element in the sorted list of unique elements from `nums` if there are at least two unique elements; otherwise, it returns None`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of integers with at least two distinct elements. It first removes duplicate elements by converting the list to a set and then sorts the resulting set of unique elements. If there are at least two unique elements, it returns the second element in the sorted list; otherwise, it returns `None`. This covers the case where `nums` contains fewer than two distinct elements, in which case the function will return `None`.
