Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates and then sorting the unique elements. If there are at least two unique elements, it returns the second element; otherwise, it returns `None`. The assertions in the problem description cover various scenarios:

1. A list with multiple unique negative and positive numbers.
2. A list with multiple unique numbers including a floating-point number.
3. A list with repeated elements where the second smallest is `None`.
4. A list with only one unique element, where the result should be `None`.

Given these cases, the code appears to handle all potential scenarios correctly as per the problem description.
