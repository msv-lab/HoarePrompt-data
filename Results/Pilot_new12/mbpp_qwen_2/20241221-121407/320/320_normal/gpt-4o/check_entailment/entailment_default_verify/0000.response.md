Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` does not correctly handle cases where there are not enough unique numbers to find the second smallest number. Specifically, for inputs like `[2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 2]`, the function incorrectly returns `2` instead of `None`. The output hints confirm that the function should return `None` in such cases, but the current implementation does not enforce this condition. Therefore, the program does not fully meet the problem description and the original assessment correctly identifies this issue.
