Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in the list. Here's why:

1. The function first converts the list to a set to remove duplicates, ensuring that only unique numbers are considered.
2. It then sorts the set (which is converted back to a list).
3. If the length of the sorted unique list is greater than 1, it returns the second element (index 1). Otherwise, it returns `None`.

This approach works for all the provided test cases:
- In the first test case, `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the unique and sorted list is `[-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest number is `-2`.
- In the second test case, `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the unique and sorted list is `[-2, -0.5, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest number is `-0.5`.
- In the third test case, `[2, 2]`, the unique and sorted list is `[2]`, which has less than two elements, so it returns `None`.
- In the fourth test case, `[2, 2, 2]`, the unique and sorted list is also `[2]`, which again has less than two elements, so it returns `None`.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and the logic seems sound, the program is correct.
