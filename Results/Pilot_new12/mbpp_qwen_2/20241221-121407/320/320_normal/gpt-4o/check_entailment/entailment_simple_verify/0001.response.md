Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in the list by first removing duplicates and then sorting the unique elements. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including lists with duplicate elements and lists with fewer than two distinct elements, and the function behaves as expected in each case. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotated version supports its correctness.
