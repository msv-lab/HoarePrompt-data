Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not handle the case when the list contains duplicate values but only one unique number. For example, if the input list is `[2, 2]`, the function should return `None` because there is no second smallest number. However, the function incorrectly returns `2`. Another example is the input list `[2, 2, 2]`, which also should return `None`, but the function again returns `2`.

To fix this, the function should check if there are at least two unique numbers before returning the second smallest number. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
```

This corrected version ensures that the function returns `None` when there are not enough unique numbers to find the second smallest number.
