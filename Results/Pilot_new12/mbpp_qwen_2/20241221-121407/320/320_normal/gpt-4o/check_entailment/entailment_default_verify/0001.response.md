Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the provided problem description and the output hints, the function `func_1` appears to be correctly implemented. The function aims to find the second smallest number in a list, and it handles various edge cases appropriately, such as lists with duplicates and lists with fewer than two distinct elements. The original assessment correctly notes that the function first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, sorts the resulting unique elements, and returns the second element if there are at least two unique elements. If not, it returns `None`. This logic aligns with the provided output hints and the test cases, confirming that the program is correct.
