Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version provides clear insight into the program's behavior and confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the second smallest number in a list. 

- The function first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set.
- It then sorts the unique elements.
- If the sorted list has more than one element, it returns the second element (index 1); otherwise, it returns `None`.

The annotations align with the problem description and the behavior observed in the provided assertions. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
