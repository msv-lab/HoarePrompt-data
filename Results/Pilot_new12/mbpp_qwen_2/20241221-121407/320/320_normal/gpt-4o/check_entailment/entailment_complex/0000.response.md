Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` aims to find the second smallest number in a list of integers. To achieve this, the function:
   - Removes duplicates by converting the list to a set (`set(nums)`).
   - Sorts the resulting set of unique elements (`sorted(set(nums))`).
   - Returns the second element in the sorted list (`unique_nums[1]`) if there are at least two unique elements.
   - Returns `None` if there are fewer than two unique elements.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - **All elements are the same**: When all elements in the list are the same (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`), the set operation removes duplicates, resulting in a list with less than two unique elements. The function correctly returns `None`.
   - **List with fewer than two elements**: While not explicitly mentioned, the function's behavior is consistent with the problem description, which states that the list should have at least two distinct elements. A list with fewer than two elements would result in an empty set, and thus, the function returns `None`.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided in the code validate the function against different scenarios:
     - The list contains both positive and negative numbers with duplicates: `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]` results in `-2`.
     - The list contains a float and a mix of positive and negative numbers: `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]` results in `-0.5`.
     - The list has exactly two identical elements: `[2, 2]` results in `None`.
     - The list has more than two identical elements: `[2, 2, 2]` results in `None`.

Since the function behaves as expected for all tested cases and the problem description aligns with the implemented logic, the program is correct.
