#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative floating-point or integer numbers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the product of length and width, where both are non-negative floating-point or integer numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be non-negative floating-point or integer numbers. It calculates and returns their product. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that require special handling. The function simply multiplies the two input values and returns the result.
