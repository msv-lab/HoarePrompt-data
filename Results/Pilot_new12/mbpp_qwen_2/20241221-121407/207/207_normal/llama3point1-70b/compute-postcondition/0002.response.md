Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be non-negative floating-point or integer numbers. It calculates and returns their product. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that require special handling. The function simply multiplies the two input values and returns the result.**

**Note:** The annotations and the code match perfectly in this case, indicating that the function behaves as intended without any missing logic or potential edge cases.
