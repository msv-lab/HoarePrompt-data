Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be non-negative floating-point or integer numbers. The function calculates and returns their product, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. Since the problem description does not specify any edge cases or additional requirements, the function correctly implements the intended behavior by simply multiplying the two input values and returning the result. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
