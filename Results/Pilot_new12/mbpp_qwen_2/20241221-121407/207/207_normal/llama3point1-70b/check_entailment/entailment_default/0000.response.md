Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the calculation of the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The problem description asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, and the function accomplishes this by returning the product of the length and width. Given the problem description and the output hints, the function works as expected for every potential case where both `length` and `width` are non-negative numbers. There are no edge cases or additional requirements mentioned that the function does not handle. Thus, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
