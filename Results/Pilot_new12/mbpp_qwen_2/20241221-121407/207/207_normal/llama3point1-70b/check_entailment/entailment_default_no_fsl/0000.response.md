Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the calculation of the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. Given that the problem description asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle and the function does exactly that, and considering the assumptions about valid inputs, the function meets the requirements for every potential case described.
