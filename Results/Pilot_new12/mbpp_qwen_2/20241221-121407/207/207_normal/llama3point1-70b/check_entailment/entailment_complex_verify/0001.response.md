Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the calculation of the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The annotations confirm that both `length` and `width` are expected to be non-negative floating-point or integer numbers, and the function simply returns their product. There are no edge cases or invalid input scenarios mentioned in the annotations that would make the function incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
