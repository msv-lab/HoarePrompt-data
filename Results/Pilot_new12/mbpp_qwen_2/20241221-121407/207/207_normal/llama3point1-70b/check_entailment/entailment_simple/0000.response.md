Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function is designed to calculate the area of a rectangle, which is done by multiplying the `length` and `width` inputs. According to the problem description, the function should accept non-negative floating-point or integer numbers as inputs for `length` and `width`. The function correctly returns the product of these two values, which is the area of the rectangle. Since the problem description only requires the function to perform this calculation without any additional checks or error handling (as per the given assumption about valid input), the program is correct.
