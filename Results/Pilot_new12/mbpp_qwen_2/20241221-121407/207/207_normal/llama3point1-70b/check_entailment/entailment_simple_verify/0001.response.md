Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The annotations confirm that the inputs are non-negative numbers, which ensures the function will work as intended under the given assumptions. Since the function behaves correctly for all valid inputs, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
