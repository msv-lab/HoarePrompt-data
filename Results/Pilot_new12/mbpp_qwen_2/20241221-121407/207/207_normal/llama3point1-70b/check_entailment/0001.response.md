Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width, which aligns with the problem description. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail as long as the inputs are valid (i.e., non-negative numbers). Since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases, the program is correct.
