#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative floating-point or integer numbers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the product of length and width, where both are non-negative floating-point or integer numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are non-negative floating-point or integer numbers. It calculates and returns their product. The function does not perform any additional operations beyond multiplication and does not handle any edge cases such as negative numbers or non-numeric inputs. If either `length` or `width` is negative, the function will still execute without raising an error but will return a negative product, which might not be the desired behavior depending on the application.
