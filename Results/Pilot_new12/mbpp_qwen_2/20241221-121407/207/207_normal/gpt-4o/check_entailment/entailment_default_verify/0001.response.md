Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The provided assertions cover various cases and confirm the function's correctness. Although the output hints mention that the function does not handle negative values, the problem description specifies that the inputs are non-negative floating-point or integer numbers. Since the problem description does not explicitly state that negative values should be handled, the function's current implementation meets the requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
