Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the problem description for finding the area of a rectangle. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the area of the rectangle. The assertions provided verify that the function works correctly with different sets of input values. Since the problem description only requires the function to calculate the area for valid, non-negative inputs, and the program handles this correctly, the program is considered correct according to the given criteria.
