Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the area of a rectangle, which is done by multiplying the `length` and `width` parameters. The problem description states that the function should find the area of a rectangle, and the provided function does exactly that by returning the product of the length and width. Additionally, the function handles non-negative floating-point or integer numbers as expected, and there are no assertions or conditions present that suggest the function behaves incorrectly for valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
