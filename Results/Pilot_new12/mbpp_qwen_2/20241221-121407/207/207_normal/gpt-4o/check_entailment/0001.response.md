Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the area of a rectangle correctly by multiplying the length and width. The assertions given in the code verify this functionality with different inputs. Since the function works as expected for the provided test cases and the logic is straightforward (area = length * width), it is reasonable to conclude that the function will work correctly for any valid input of length and width. There are no apparent edge cases or logical errors that would cause the function to fail.
