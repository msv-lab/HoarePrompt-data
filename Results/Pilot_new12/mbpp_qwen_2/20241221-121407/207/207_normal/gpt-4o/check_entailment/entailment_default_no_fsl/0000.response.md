Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. The assertions provided cover three different scenarios (positive integers and a smaller positive integer). Given the problem description asks to find the area of a rectangle, which is calculated as the product of its length and width, the provided function correctly implements this logic. The output hints mention that the function does not handle negative numbers or non-numeric inputs, but the problem description does not specify these cases explicitly. Since the code works correctly for the given examples and the problem does not require handling invalid inputs, the code meets the requirements for the described task.
