Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The function is tested with three different sets of inputs, and it returns the expected results. Since the area of a rectangle is defined as the product of its length and width, the program accurately implements this formula. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues with the provided code that would cause it to fail for other inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
