Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product. The problem description asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, which is calculated by multiplying the length and width. The provided test cases (`assert func_1(10, 20) == 200`, `assert func_1(10, 5) == 50`, `assert func_1(4, 2) == 8`) correctly demonstrate that the function behaves as intended for positive integer values. 

The output hints confirm that the function simply multiplies the two parameters and returns the result. Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function works correctly for the expected inputs. There are no indications that the function fails for any other valid input, such as non-integer values or negative numbers, under the assumption that these cases are outside the scope of the problem description. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
