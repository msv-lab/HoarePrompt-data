Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts non-negative floating-point or integer numbers as inputs and returns their product. Although the annotated version mentions that the function does not handle edge cases like negative numbers or non-numeric inputs, the original problem statement assumes valid inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The original assessment is accurate in this context.
