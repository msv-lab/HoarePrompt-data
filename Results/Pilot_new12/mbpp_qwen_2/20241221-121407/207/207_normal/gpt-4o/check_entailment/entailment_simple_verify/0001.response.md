Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The provided assertions verify this functionality with different inputs, and the annotations confirm that the function operates on non-negative floating-point or integer numbers, which aligns with the problem description of finding the area of a rectangle. Since there are no apparent edge cases or logical errors that would cause the function to fail under the assumption of valid input, the original assessment of correctness being True remains valid.
