Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It removes characters from the given string that have odd index values, effectively keeping only the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). 

The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string indices. It includes only those characters whose indices are even (`i % 2 == 0`). Finally, it joins these characters into a new string and returns it.

The provided test cases also validate this behavior:

- `func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'`
- `func_1('python') == 'pto'`
- `func_1('data') == 'dt'`
- `func_1('lambs') == 'lms'`

Each test case demonstrates that the function correctly returns a new string with characters at even indices from the original string, aligning perfectly with the problem description.
