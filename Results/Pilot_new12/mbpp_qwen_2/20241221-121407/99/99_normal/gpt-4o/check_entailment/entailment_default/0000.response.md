Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the function to remove characters with odd index values from a given string. The function `func_1` iterates through the string and includes only the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which aligns with the problem description. The provided assertions and output hints confirm that the function works as expected for the given examples. There are no apparent edge cases or issues with the implementation that would cause the function to fail for any potential input under the given assumptions.
