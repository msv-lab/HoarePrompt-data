Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) of the original string. This matches the requirement to remove characters with odd index values. The provided assertions also validate this behavior:

- `func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'`: The characters at indices 0, 2, and 4 ('a', 'c', 'e') are returned.
- `func_1('python') == 'pto'`: The characters at indices 0, 2, and 4 ('p', 't', 'o') are returned.
- `func_1('data') == 'dt'`: The characters at indices 0 and 2 ('d', 't') are returned.
- `func_1('lambs') == 'lms'`: The characters at indices 0, 2, and 4 ('l', 'm', 's') are returned.

The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string and includes only those characters where the index is even. Therefore, it correctly removes characters with odd index values as specified in the problem description.
