Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. The function `func_1` uses list comprehension to iterate over the string, including only characters with even indices. This logic matches the problem description accurately. The assertions provided also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since the function handles the provided examples correctly and the logic seems sound, there are no apparent cases where the program would fail to meet the problem description.
