Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly removes characters from a string that have odd index values. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string and include only characters with even indices. This logic works for all given test cases and, more generally, for any string input. Since the program correctly implements the described functionality for the given examples and there are no obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail, the program is correct.
