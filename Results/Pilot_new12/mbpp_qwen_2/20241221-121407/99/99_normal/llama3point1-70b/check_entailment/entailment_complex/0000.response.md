Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character. This is achieved using a generator expression within the `join` method, which iterates over the indices of the string in steps of 2 (i.e., 0, 2, 4, ...). 

Given the problem description: "Write a python function to remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string," the function effectively removes characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) while keeping the characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs.
