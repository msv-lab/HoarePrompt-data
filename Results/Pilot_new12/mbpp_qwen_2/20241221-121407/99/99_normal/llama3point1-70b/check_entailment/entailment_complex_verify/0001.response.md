Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters with odd index values from the given string `s` by iterating over the string with a step of 2, starting from index 0. The annotated version confirms that the function returns a string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character. This behavior matches the problem description perfectly, and there are no edge cases or inputs for which this function would fail under the assumption of valid input. Therefore, the program is correct.
