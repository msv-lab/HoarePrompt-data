Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters with odd index values from the given string `s` by iterating over the string with a step of 2, starting from index 0. This matches the problem description of removing characters with odd index values. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character. There are no edge cases or inputs mentioned that would cause the function to fail, and the function does not perform any additional actions beyond the described behavior. Therefore, the program is correct.
