Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character (index 0). This is achieved using a generator expression inside the `join` method, where `range(0, len(s), 2)` generates indices starting from 0 up to the length of the string with a step of 2. Therefore, the program correctly removes characters at odd indices, as required.
