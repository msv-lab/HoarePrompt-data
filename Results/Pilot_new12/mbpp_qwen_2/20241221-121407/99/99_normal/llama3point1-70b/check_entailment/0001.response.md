Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters with odd index values from the given string `s`. It iterates over the string with a step of 2, starting from index 0, which effectively keeps only the characters with even indices. This matches the problem description perfectly, and there are no apparent edge cases or inputs for which this function would fail. Therefore, the program is correct.
