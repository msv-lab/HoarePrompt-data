Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` and returns a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character. This matches the requirement to remove characters with odd index values. The function uses a generator expression within the `join` method to iterate over the string with a step of 2, effectively skipping every other character. Since the problem description does not mention any specific edge cases or additional requirements, and the provided code meets the basic requirement for all given examples, the code is correct.
