Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values by iterating over the string and including only characters at even indices. The output hints confirm that the function returns a new string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character. Since the program meets the problem description and the output hints support this behavior, the original assessment is correct.
