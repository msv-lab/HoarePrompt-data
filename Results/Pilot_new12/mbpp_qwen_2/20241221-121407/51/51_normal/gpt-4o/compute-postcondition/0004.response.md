The code multiplies the value of `product` by `num`. Initially, `product` is the second element in the list `numbers`, and `num` is also the second element in the list `numbers`. Therefore, after executing `product *= num`, `product` will be updated to the product of its original value and the value of `num`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floating-point numbers, `product` is the second element in the list multiplied by itself, `num` is the second element in the list, `index` is 1**
