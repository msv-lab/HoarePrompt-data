The code assigns the value of `product / len(numbers)` to the variable `result`. The `product` is the product of all elements in the list `numbers`, and `len(numbers)` gives the number of elements in the list. The `num` variable remains the last element in the list, and `index` remains the length of the list minus one. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floating-point numbers, `product` is the product of all elements in the list, `num` is the last element in the list, `index` is the length of the list minus one, `result` is `product / len(numbers)`**
