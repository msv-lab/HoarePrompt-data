State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floating-point numbers, `product` is 1, `num` is the first element in the list, index is 0** 

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each element in the list `numbers`.
   - For the loop to start executing, `numbers` must contain at least one element (i.e., it must be a non-empty list).

2. **Initialization**: The variable `product` is initialized to 1 before the loop starts.

3. **First Iteration**:
   - In the first iteration, `num` should be the first element of the list `numbers`, and the index of this element should be 0.

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `numbers` must be a non-empty list.
- `product` remains 1.
- `num` must be the first element in the list.
- The index (implied by the loop's nature) should be 0.
