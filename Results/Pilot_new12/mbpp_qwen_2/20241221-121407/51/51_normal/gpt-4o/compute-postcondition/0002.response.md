The code `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by the value of `num`. Given the initial state where `product` is 1 and `num` is the first element in the list `numbers`, the value of `product` will be updated to `1 * num`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floating-point numbers, `product` is `num`, `num` is the first element in the list, index is 0**
