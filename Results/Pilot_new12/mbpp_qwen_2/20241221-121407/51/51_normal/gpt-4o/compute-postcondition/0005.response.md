Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floating-point numbers.
   - `product` is the second element in the list multiplied by itself.
   - `num` is the second element in the list.
   - `index` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `numbers`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the second element in the list, and `index` is 1.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `index` must be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `num` will then become the third element in the list (since indexing starts at 0).
   - `product` will be updated to be the third element in the list multiplied by itself.

5. **Adjusted States**:
   - `numbers` remains a non-empty list of integers or floating-point numbers.
   - `num` becomes the third element in the list.
   - `index` is now 2.
   - `product` is the third element in the list multiplied by itself.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floating-point numbers, `num` is the third element in the list, `index` is 2, `product` is the third element in the list multiplied by itself**.
