Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `numbers` containing integers or floating-point numbers and returns the average of these numbers calculated as the product of all elements in the list divided by the length of the list. This function handles an empty list by returning 0, as the product would be 1 and dividing 1 by the length of an empty list (0) results in 0. There are no other potential edge cases as the code does not include handling for non-numeric types or other exceptions.**
