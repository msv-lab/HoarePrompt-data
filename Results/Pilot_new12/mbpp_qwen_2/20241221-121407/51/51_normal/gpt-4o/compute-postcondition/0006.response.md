The code multiplies `product` by `num`. Given that `num` is the third element in the list `numbers`, and `product` is initially the third element in the list multiplied by itself, the new value of `product` will be the square of the third element in the list multiplied by the third element in the list again.

Let's denote the third element in the list `numbers` as `num_third`. So, initially, `product = num_third * num_third`.

After running `product *= num`, the value of `product` will be `num_third * num_third * num_third`, which is `num_third ** 3`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floating-point numbers, `num` is the third element in the list, `index` is 2, `product` is the cube of the third element in the list**
