#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floating-point numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a non-empty list of integers or floating-point numbers, `product` is the product of all elements in the list, `num` is the last element in the list, `index` is the length of the list minus one.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns product divided by the length of list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `numbers` containing integers or floating-point numbers and returns the average of these numbers calculated as the product of all elements in the list divided by the length of the list. This function handles an empty list by returning 0, as the product would be 1 and dividing 1 by the length of an empty list (0) results in 0. There are no other potential edge cases as the code does not include handling for non-numeric types or other exceptions.
