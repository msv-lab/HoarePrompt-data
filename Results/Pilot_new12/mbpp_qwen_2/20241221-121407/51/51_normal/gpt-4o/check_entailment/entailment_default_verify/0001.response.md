Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly multiplies all numbers in a list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The provided output hints confirm that the function handles an empty list by returning 0, which aligns with the expected behavior (since the product of an empty list is 1 and dividing by the length of the list, which is 0, effectively results in 0). The assertions cover various scenarios (positive numbers, negative numbers, and a mix of positive and negative numbers) and the function passes these tests. There are no indications of any edge cases or scenarios where the function fails based on the problem description and the provided output hints. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
