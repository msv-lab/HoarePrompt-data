Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to meet the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers (integers or floats) and returns the product of all numbers in the list divided by the length of the list. The examples given in the problem description and the assertions confirm that the function works correctly for the provided test cases:

1. The first assertion tests a list with both positive and negative numbers, and the result is `-67.2`.
2. The second assertion tests a list with negative numbers, and the result is `-2000.0`.
3. The third assertion tests a list with positive numbers, and the result is `1710.0`.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the function handles the multiplication and division correctly. The function also implicitly handles an empty list by returning `0`, as the product of an empty list is `1`, and dividing `1` by the length of the list (which is `0`) results in `0`.

Since the code satisfies the problem description and the provided examples and assertions work as expected, the program is correct.
