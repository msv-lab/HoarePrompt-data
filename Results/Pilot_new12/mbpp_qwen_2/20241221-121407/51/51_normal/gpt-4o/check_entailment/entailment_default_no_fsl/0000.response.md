Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. The code handles the case of an empty list by returning 0, as the product of an empty list is 1 and dividing 1 by the length of an empty list (0) results in 0. The provided assertions also validate this behavior and the general functionality of the function. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case within the given assumptions.
