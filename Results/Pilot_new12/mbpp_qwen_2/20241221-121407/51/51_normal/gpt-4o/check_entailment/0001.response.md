Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the requirement of multiplying all numbers in a list and then dividing the product by the length of the list. The assertions provided in the code cover several different scenarios (positive numbers, negative numbers, and a mix of positive and negative numbers), and the function passes these tests. There doesn't seem to be any edge case or specific scenario that the current implementation does not handle correctly based on the given problem description and test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
