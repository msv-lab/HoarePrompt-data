Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(numbers)` is designed to take a list of numbers (either integers or floating-point numbers) and return the product of all the numbers in the list divided by the length of the list.

2. **Initial State**: The function starts with initializing `product` to 1. This is correct because multiplying any number by 1 does not change its value, and it ensures that the multiplication operation begins from 1.

3. **Multiplication Loop**: A `for` loop iterates over each element in the list `numbers`, multiplying the current value of `product` by each element. This correctly computes the product of all the numbers in the list.

4. **Result Calculation**: After the loop, the product is divided by the length of the list (`len(numbers)`), which is exactly what the problem description requires.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the code check the function with different sets of inputs to ensure it produces the expected results within a relative tolerance. This helps verify that the function works as intended for various cases.

6. **Input Validity Assumption**: As mentioned in the problem statement, the assumption is made that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors. Therefore, the function handles this assumption correctly by expecting a list of numbers and performing the necessary operations without additional error handling for invalid inputs (like checking if the input is indeed a list).

Since the function performs all required steps accurately and handles the expected inputs as per the problem description, the program is correct.
