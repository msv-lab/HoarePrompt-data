#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is the product of all elements in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers, and `numbers` must have at least one element.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of all elements in 'numbers' divided by the length of the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the arithmetic mean of the elements in the list, which is calculated as the product of all elements in the list divided by the length of the list. The function handles the case where the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function would normally raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, but the provided code does not handle this case explicitly. Therefore, the function should be considered undefined or invalid for an empty list input.
