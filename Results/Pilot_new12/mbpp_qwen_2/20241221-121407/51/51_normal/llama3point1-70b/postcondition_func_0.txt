The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `numbers` and returns the arithmetic mean of the elements in the list, which is calculated as the product of all elements in the list divided by the length of the list. The function handles the case where the list is not empty. If the list is empty, the function would normally raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, but the provided code does not handle this case explicitly. Therefore, the function should be considered undefined or invalid for an empty list input.
