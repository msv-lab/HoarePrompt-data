Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is correct because it multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle the case where the input list is empty. Specifically, attempting to divide by the length of an empty list would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. Although the provided code does not explicitly handle this case, the function's behavior is undefined for an empty list, which contradicts the problem description's expectation of returning a meaningful result (the arithmetic mean). Therefore, the function is not fully correct according to the problem description and the output hints.
