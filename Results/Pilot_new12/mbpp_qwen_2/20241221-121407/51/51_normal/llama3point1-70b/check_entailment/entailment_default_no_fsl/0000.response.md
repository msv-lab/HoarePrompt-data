Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle the case where the input list is empty. When the list is empty, attempting to divide by its length (which is 0) will result in a `ZeroDivisionError`. According to the problem description, the function should multiply all the numbers in the list and then divide by the length of the list. However, the code does not include any logic to handle the empty list scenario, leading to undefined behavior for this case.
