Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The code handles the case where the list is not empty, as specified in the problem description. While the output hints mention that the function does not handle the case where the list is empty, the problem description does not explicitly require handling this case. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case specified in the problem description.
