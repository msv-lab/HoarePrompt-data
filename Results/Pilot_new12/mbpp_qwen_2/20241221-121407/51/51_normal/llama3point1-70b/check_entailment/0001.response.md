Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. This logic aligns with the problem description for any input list of numbers, including edge cases such as an empty list (where the function returns 0) and lists containing negative numbers or zero. Since the function behaves as expected for all considered cases, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
