Final: **False**

Reasoning: Although the provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and divides the product by the length of the list, the original assessment overlooks the case where the input list is empty. The function does not handle the division by zero error that occurs when the list is empty. According to the annotated version, the function should be considered undefined or invalid for an empty list input. Therefore, the original assessment is not entirely accurate as it does not account for this potential issue.
