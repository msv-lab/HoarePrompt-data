Final: **False**

Reason: Although the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide by the length of the list, it does not handle the case where the input list is empty. The function would raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if called with an empty list. According to the problem description and the output hints, the function should return 0 for an empty list, but the current implementation does not account for this scenario. Therefore, the original assessment cannot be maintained as true because the function is not fully correct according to the problem description.
