Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The annotated version confirms that after the for loop, `product` holds the product of all elements in `numbers`, and `numbers` is guaranteed to have at least one element (since an empty list would result in a division by zero, which is handled by the assumption of valid input). Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
