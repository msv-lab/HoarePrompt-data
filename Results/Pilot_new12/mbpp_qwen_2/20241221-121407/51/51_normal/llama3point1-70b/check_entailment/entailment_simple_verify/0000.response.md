Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The annotated version confirms that after the for loop, `product` contains the multiplication of all elements in `numbers`, and `numbers` must have at least one element to avoid division by zero. Since the input is assumed to be valid (a non-empty list of integers), the program will not encounter an error, and it will correctly perform the required operation as described in the problem statement.
