Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the result by the length of the list. The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers as input and returns the arithmetic mean of the elements in the list, calculated as the product of all elements divided by the length of the list. 

The program handles a non-empty list as specified in the problem description. Although the program does not explicitly handle the case where the list might be empty (which would result in a division by zero error), the problem description states that we should assume the input will be valid. Given this assumption, the program is considered correct. If the list were empty, the function would indeed raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, but this is outside the scope of the given problem description, as per the instructions.
