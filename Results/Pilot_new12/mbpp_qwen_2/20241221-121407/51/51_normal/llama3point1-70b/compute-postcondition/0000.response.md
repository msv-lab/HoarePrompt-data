The code initializes the variable `product` to 1. The value of `numbers` remains unchanged as no operation involving `numbers` is performed in the given snippet. Therefore, the only variable affected is `product`, which is now set to 1.

Output State: **`product` is 1, `numbers` is a list of integers**
