The code `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by the current value of `num`. Based on the previous state, `product` is the first element of `numbers`, and `num` is the second element of `numbers`. After this operation, `product` will be updated to the product of these two values. 

Output State: **`product` is the product of the first and second elements of `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, the index is 1, and `num` is the second element of `numbers`.**
