The initial state is defined as follows:
- `product` is the product of the first and third elements of `numbers`.
- `numbers` is a list of integers with at least two elements.
- The index is 2, which means the third element of `numbers` exists.
- `num` is the third element of `numbers`.

The code snippet is:
```python
product *= num
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The value of `product` is initially the product of the first and third elements of `numbers`.
2. The operation `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by `num`.

Since `num` is the third element of `numbers`, and `product` was initially the product of the first and third elements of `numbers`, the new value of `product` becomes the product of the first element, the third element (which is also `num`), and itself.

Therefore, the new value of `product` is the product of the first, second (third), and third elements of `numbers`.

Output State: **`product` is the product of the first, second, and third elements of `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers that must have at least two elements, the index is 2, and `num` is the third element of `numbers`.**
