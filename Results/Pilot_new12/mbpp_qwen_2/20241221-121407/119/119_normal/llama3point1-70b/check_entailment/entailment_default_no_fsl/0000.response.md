Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, which exactly matches the problem description. Since the function directly swaps the values and returns them in the required format, it works correctly for every potential case within the given constraints. The output hints also confirm this behavior. Therefore, the function is correct.
