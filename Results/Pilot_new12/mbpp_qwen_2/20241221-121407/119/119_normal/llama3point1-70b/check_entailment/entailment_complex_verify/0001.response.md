Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(a, b)` correctly returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which aligns with the problem description. The annotated version confirms that the function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are numbers, and returns them in a tuple where `b` is the first element and `a` is the second element. There are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail, and the code directly implements the required functionality. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
