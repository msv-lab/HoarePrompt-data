Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number, which matches the requirements specified in the problem description. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function returns `b` and `a` in that order. Since the inputs are assumed to be valid, there are no issues with edge cases or invalid inputs. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
