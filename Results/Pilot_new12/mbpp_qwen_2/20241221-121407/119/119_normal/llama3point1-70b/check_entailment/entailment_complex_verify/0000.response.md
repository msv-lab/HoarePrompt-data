Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(a, b)` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns them as a tuple, which exactly matches the problem description. The annotated version also supports this by stating that the function "swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them in a tuple," aligning with the requirement to return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. Since there are no edge cases or conditions mentioned in the problem description or the annotations that would cause the function to fail, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
