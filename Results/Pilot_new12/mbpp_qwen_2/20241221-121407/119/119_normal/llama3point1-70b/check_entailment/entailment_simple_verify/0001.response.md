Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(a, b)` returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which matches the problem description of returning a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `b` and then `a` as intended. Since the program behaves as specified and there are no contradictions between the annotations and the problem description, the original assessment remains accurate.
