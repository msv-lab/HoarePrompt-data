Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the problem description. It takes two numbers `a` and `b` as inputs and returns a tuple containing `b` followed by `a`. The function directly returns `b, a` without any additional operations, ensuring that the output matches the specified requirement for all valid inputs. Since the problem description only specifies the functionality required without mentioning any edge cases (such as non-numeric inputs), and the provided code handles the described behavior accurately, the function is correct according to the given problem description.
