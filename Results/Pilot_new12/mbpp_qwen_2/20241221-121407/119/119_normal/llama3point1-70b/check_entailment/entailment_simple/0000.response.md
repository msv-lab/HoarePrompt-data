Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are assumed to be numbers (integers or floats). The function returns a tuple containing the second parameter `b` followed by the first parameter `a`. This exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. Therefore, the program correctly implements the specified functionality.
