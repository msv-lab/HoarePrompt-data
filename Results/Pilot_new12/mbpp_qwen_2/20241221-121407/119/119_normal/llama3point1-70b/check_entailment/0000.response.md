Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(a, b)` correctly returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. This meets the requirements specified in the problem description for any pair of input numbers. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail, as it simply swaps the positions of the two inputs and returns them in a tuple.
