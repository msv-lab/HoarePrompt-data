Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the requirement of returning a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The provided output hints confirm that the function simply swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them in a tuple. Since the problem description and the function implementation match perfectly, and there are no edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail under the given assumptions, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
