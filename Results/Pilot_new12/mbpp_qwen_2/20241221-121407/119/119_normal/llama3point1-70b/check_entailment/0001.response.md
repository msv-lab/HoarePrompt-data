Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(a, b)` returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which exactly matches the problem description. For any two inputs `a` and `b`, the function returns a tuple where the second element is `b` and the first element is `a`. Since the function works as expected for any pair of numbers, there is no case where the program fails to meet the requirements.
