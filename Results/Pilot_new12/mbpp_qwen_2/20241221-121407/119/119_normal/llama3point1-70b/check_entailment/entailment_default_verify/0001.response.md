Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the problem description. It takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple where the second element is `b` and the first element is `a`. The output hints confirm that the function simply swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them in a tuple, which aligns with the problem description. Since there are no edge cases or invalid input scenarios mentioned that would cause the function to fail, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
