Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the problem description by swapping the values of `a` and `b` and returning them as a tuple `(b, a)`. Given that the problem description is straightforward and the function directly returns the swapped values without any additional checks or operations, the program works as expected for every potential case of valid inputs (both integers or floats). The output hints confirm that the function behaves as described, and there are no edge cases or invalid input scenarios mentioned that would cause the program to fail.
