The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both are numbers (integers or floats). It swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them in a tuple. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotation, and the code directly returns the swapped values without any additional checks or operations. Therefore, after the function concludes, the return values will be the original value of `b` and `a`, respectively.
