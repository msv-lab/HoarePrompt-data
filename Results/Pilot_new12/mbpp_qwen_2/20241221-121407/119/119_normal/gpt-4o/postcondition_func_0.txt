The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are numbers (integers or floats). It returns a tuple containing `b` followed by `a`. This means that regardless of the types of `a` and `b`, the function will always return a tuple where the first element is `b` and the second element is `a`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special consideration, as the function behaves consistently for all valid inputs.
