Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple where the second element is `b` and the first element is `a`. This matches the problem description perfectly. The function is tested with three assertions, and it passes all of them. Given the structure of the function and the test cases, there are no obvious edge cases or potential inputs where this function would fail to meet the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
