Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(a, b)` correctly swaps the two input numbers and returns them as a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The assertions in the code cover multiple test cases, including different integer values. Given the problem description and the function implementation, the function works as expected for every potential case within the constraints of the problem. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as intended, returning a tuple where the first element is `b` and the second element is `a`. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
