Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly swaps the order of the two input numbers and returns them as a tuple. The assertions provided in the code cover multiple cases, and the output hints confirm that the function consistently returns a tuple where the first element is `b` and the second element is `a`. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified in the provided information, and the function behaves as expected for all tested cases. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
