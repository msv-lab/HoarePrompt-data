Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple where the first element is `b` and the second element is `a`. The assertions in the code verify this behavior for different pairs of integers. Given the problem description and the output hints, the function consistently returns the expected results for all valid inputs. Since there are no edge cases or specific scenarios mentioned that would cause the function to fail, and all provided test cases are satisfied, the program is correct.
