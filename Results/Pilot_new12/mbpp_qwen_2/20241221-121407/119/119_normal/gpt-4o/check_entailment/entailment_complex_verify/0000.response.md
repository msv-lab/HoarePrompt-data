Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple where the second element is `b` and the first element is `a`. This matches the problem description perfectly. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. The annotated version of the code correctly describes the function's behavior, stating that it returns a tuple containing `b` followed by `a` regardless of the types of `a` and `b` (as long as they are numbers). There are no edge cases mentioned that would cause the function to fail, and the function handles all valid inputs correctly. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided code.
