Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple where the second element is `b` and the first element is `a`. The provided assertions also correctly test this behavior:

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`

These examples show that the function consistently returns a tuple with the elements in the reversed order as specified. Since the function handles all valid input pairs as described, it is correct according to the problem statement.
