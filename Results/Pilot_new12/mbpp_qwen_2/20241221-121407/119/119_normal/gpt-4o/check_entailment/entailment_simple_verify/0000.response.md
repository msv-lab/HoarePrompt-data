Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the annotated code. The function `func_1` correctly swaps the positions of the two input numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The annotated code confirms that before the function call, `a` and `b` are numbers, and after the function call, it returns `b` and `a`. The function passes all the provided assertions, and there are no issues with the structure of the function or the provided inputs. Therefore, the program meets the problem description, and the original assessment is correct.
