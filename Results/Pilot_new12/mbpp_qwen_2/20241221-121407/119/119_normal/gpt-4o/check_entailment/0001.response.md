Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly swaps the order of the two input numbers and returns them as a tuple. The assertions provided in the code cover several cases:

1. `assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)`
2. `assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)`
3. `assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)`

These examples show that the function works as expected for different pairs of integers. Since the function consistently returns the correct tuple for the given inputs, and no edge cases or potential issues have been identified, the program meets the problem description for all tested cases.
