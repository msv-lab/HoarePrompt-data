Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code provides a clear understanding of the state and behavior of the program. The function `func_1` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with `b` followed by `a`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the function to take two numbers and return a tuple where the second number is followed by the first number.

The provided assertions cover various cases and demonstrate that the function works as intended for different inputs. Since the function consistently returns the correct tuple for the given inputs and the annotations confirm the expected behavior at each step, the program meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as True.
