Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly swaps the order of the two input numbers and returns them as a tuple. The provided assertions cover various cases, and the annotated version confirms that the function consistently returns the expected results. There are no edge cases or potential issues identified that would lead to a different assessment. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
