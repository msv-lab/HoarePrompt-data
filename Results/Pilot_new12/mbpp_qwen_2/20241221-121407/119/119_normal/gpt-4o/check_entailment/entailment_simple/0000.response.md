Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. The test cases in the annotations confirm this behavior:

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`

Each test case shows that the function swaps the positions of the two input numbers and returns them in the desired order. Since the program consistently performs this operation for the given inputs, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
