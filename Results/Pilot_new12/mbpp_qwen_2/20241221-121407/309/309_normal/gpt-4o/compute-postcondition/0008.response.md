According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:

- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `first_char` is the first character of `s`.
- `char` is the first character of `s` and is equal to `first_char`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following steps need to be considered:

1. The variable `char` will be set to the next character in the string `s`.
2. The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.

Since `s` is a non-empty string and we are iterating through each character, the string `s` will still be non-empty, but the first character `char` will change to the next character in the string.

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `s` remains a non-empty string.
- `first_char` is the current first character of `s`.
- `char` will be the next character in `s`.

To reflect this, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the current first character of `s`, `char` will be the next character in `s`**
