According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`. The loop continues as long as there are characters left in the string `s`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `first_char` is the current first character of `s`.
- `char` is the next character in `s`.
- If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function continues to the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be equal to `first_char`. This means that the current character `char` is the same as the first character `first_char`, and we move to the next character in the string `s`.

Let's adjust the states accordingly:

- Since `char` is the next character in `s`, it will be the new first character of the remaining string.
- `s` will now be the remaining part of the string after removing the current `char`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `s` is a non-empty string (excluding the current `char`).
- `first_char` is the current first character of the remaining `s`.
- `char` is the next character in the remaining `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string (excluding the current `char`), `first_char` is the current first character of the remaining `s`, `char` is the next character in the remaining `s`**
