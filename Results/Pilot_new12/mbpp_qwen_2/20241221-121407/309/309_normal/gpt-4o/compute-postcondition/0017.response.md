Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns `True` if all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise. The function checks the length of the string and immediately returns `True` if the string is empty. It then verifies if all characters in the string are identical by comparing each character with the first character. If any character differs, it returns `False`. The function handles the case where the string is empty by returning `True`, and correctly identifies strings with all identical characters or non-identical characters.**

This summary covers all potential edge cases and includes the logic performed by the code without detailing the implementation.
