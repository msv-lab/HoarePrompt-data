State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s` and the loop will start with `char` being equal to `first_char`**

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The for loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
2. For the loop to start executing, `s` must be a non-empty string because an empty string would not have any characters to iterate over.
3. The variable `first_char` is defined as the first character of `s`. This is given.
4. At the start of the loop, `char` should be initialized to the first character of `s` to match the condition of the first iteration.

Therefore, the initial state needs to ensure that `s` is non-empty and that `char` is set to the first character of `s` for the loop to begin executing.
