#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: s is a non-empty string
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string where all characters are equal to the first character of the original string `first_char`.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as a parameter and returns `True` if all characters in the string are the same, and `False` otherwise. The function checks the length of the string and immediately returns `True` if the string is empty. It then verifies if all characters in the string are identical by comparing each character with the first character. If any character differs, it returns `False`. The function handles the case where the string is empty by returning `True`, and correctly identifies strings with all identical characters or non-identical characters.
