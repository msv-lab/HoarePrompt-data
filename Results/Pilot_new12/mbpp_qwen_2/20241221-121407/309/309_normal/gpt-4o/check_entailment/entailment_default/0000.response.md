Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a given string `s` are the same. It handles the case where the string is empty by returning `True`, which is correct since an empty string trivially has all characters the same. For non-empty strings, it iterates through each character and compares it to the first character. If any character differs, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, and the provided test cases (`assert func_1('python') == False`, `assert func_1('aaa') == True`, `assert func_1('data') == False`) demonstrate the correct behavior for various inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
