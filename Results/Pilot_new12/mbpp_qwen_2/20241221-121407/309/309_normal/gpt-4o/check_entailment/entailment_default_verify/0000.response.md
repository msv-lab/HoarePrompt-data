Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check whether all characters in a given string are the same. It handles the edge case of an empty string by returning `True`, which is correct as per the problem description. The function iterates through each character in the string and compares it to the first character, returning `False` as soon as it finds a differing character. If all characters match, it returns `True`. The provided test cases (`assert func_1('python') == False`, `assert func_1('aaa') == True`, `assert func_1('data') == False`) also confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
