Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a string are the same. It works correctly for the given test cases:
- `func_1('python') == False`: The characters in 'python' are different.
- `func_1('aaa') == True`: All characters in 'aaa' are the same.
- `func_1('data') == False`: The characters in 'data' are different.

The function logic is sound:
1. It returns `True` if the string is empty.
2. It checks if each character in the string matches the first character.

Given these test cases and the function logic, there doesn't seem to be any edge case or potential input that would make the function behave incorrectly according to the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
