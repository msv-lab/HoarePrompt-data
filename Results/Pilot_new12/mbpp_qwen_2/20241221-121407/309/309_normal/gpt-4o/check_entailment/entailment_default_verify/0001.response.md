Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to check if all characters in a string are the same. The provided test cases (`func_1('python') == False`, `func_1('aaa') == True`, `func_1('data') == False`) align with the problem description and the output hints. The function returns `True` for an empty string, which is also expected behavior as per the problem description. The logic of checking if each character matches the first character is sound and correctly identifies strings with all identical or non-identical characters. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
