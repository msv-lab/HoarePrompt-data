Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether all characters in a given string are the same. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Empty String Case**: The function returns `True` immediately if the string is empty (`if (not s)`), which aligns with the requirement because an empty string trivially has all characters the same (since there are no characters).

2. **Non-Empty String Case**: For non-empty strings, the function sets the first character as a reference (`first_char = s[0]`). It then iterates through the string and checks each character against this reference. If any character differs from `first_char`, it returns `False`. If all characters match `first_char`, it returns `True`.

Given the test cases provided:
- `func_1('python')` returns `False` because not all characters are the same.
- `func_1('aaa')` returns `True` because all characters are the same.
- `func_1('data')` returns `False` because not all characters are the same.

These results align perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
