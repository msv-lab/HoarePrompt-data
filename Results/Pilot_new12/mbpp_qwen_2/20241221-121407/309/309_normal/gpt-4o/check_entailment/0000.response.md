Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in a string are the same. It handles the empty string case by returning `True`, which is correct because an empty string technically has all characters the same (there are no different characters). For non-empty strings, it compares each character to the first character and returns `False` as soon as it finds a differing character. If all characters match, it returns `True`. Based on the provided test cases and the logic of the function, there doesn't seem to be any scenario where the function would fail to meet the problem description.
