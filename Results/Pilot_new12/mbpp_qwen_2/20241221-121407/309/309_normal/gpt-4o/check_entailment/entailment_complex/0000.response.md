Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Empty String Case**: The function returns `True` if the input string `s` is empty. This aligns with the requirement to check if all characters are the same. An empty string technically has no different characters.

2. **Non-Empty String Case**: For non-empty strings, the function iterates through each character in the string and compares it with the first character. If any character differs from the first character, the function immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, if all characters are the same, it returns `True`.

3. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases confirm the function's behavior:
   - `func_1('python')` returns `False` because not all characters are the same.
   - `func_1('aaa')` returns `True` because all characters are the same.
   - `func_1('data')` returns `False` because not all characters are the same.

4. **Logic**: The logic inside the function ensures that if the string is non-empty, it checks if all characters are the same by comparing each character with the first one. This is consistent with the problem description.

Given that the function behaves as expected for all valid inputs (as per the problem description), the program is correct.
