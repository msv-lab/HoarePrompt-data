Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in a string are the same. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected:

- For an empty string, the function returns `True`, which is correct.
- For a string with all identical characters (like 'aaa'), the function returns `True`.
- For a string with different characters (like 'python' and 'data'), the function returns `False`.

The annotations support the correctness of the function. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
