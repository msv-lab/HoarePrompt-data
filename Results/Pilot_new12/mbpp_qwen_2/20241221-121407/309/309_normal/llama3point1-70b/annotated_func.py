#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all characters in string 's' are the same, otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and checks whether all characters in the string are identical. It returns `True` if all characters are the same, and `False` otherwise. This is achieved by converting the string into a set, which removes duplicate characters, and then checking if the length of the set is 1. If the length is 1, it means all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, they are different. Potential edge cases include an empty string or a string with only one character, which both would return `True` since there are no differing characters.
