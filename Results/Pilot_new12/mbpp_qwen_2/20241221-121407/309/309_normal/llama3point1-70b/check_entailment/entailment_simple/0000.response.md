Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set of its characters. Since a set contains only unique elements, if all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain exactly one element. Therefore, the condition `len(set(s)) == 1` will evaluate to `True` if all characters are the same and `False` otherwise. This logic perfectly matches the requirement of the problem description.
