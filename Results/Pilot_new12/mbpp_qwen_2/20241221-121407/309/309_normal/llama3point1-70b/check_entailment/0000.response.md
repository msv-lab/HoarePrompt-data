Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This approach correctly identifies whether all characters in the string are identical for any input string. Since the function works as expected for all tested cases and there are no edge cases that violate the problem description, the program is correct.
