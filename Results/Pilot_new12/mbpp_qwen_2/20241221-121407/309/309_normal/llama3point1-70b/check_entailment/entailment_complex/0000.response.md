Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same. The function works by converting the string into a set, which removes any duplicate characters. If the length of the resulting set is 1, it means all characters in the string are identical, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach handles all potential cases according to the problem description:
- An empty string returns `True` because there are no differing characters.
- A string with only one character also returns `True` since there are no differing characters.
- A string with multiple distinct characters returns `False`.
- The function only processes the input as a string, adhering to the assumption that the input will be valid.

Thus, the function `func_1` always meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
