Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to check whether all characters in a string are the same. The function `func_1(s)` converts the string `s` into a set, which removes any duplicate characters. If the length of the resulting set is 1, it means all characters in the string are the same, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach handles all potential cases, including:
- An empty string (`""`), which returns `True` because there are no differing characters.
- A string with only one character, which also returns `True`.
- A string with multiple distinct characters, which returns `False`.

The output hints confirm that the function works as intended, and there are no edge cases or inputs where the provided code would fail based on the given problem description.
