Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and verifying if the length of the set is 1. This approach works for all potential cases, including an empty string (which returns `True` because there are no differing characters) and a string with only one character (which also returns `True`). The code handles these cases as expected based on the problem description and the output hints.
