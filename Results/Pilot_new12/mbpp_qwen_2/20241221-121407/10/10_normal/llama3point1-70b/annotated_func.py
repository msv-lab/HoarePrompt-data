#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a positive integer or float representing the base length of the triangular prism, h is a positive integer or float representing the height of the triangular prism's triangular face, and l is a positive integer or float representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns (b * h / 2) * l, where 'b' is the base length of the triangular prism, 'h' is the height of the triangular prism's triangular face, and 'l' is the length of the prism
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b` (base length of the triangular prism), `h` (height of the triangular prism's triangular face), and `l` (length of the prism). It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\). There are no edge cases or missing functionality noted in the provided code.
