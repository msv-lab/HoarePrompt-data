The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`. 

- `b` is a positive integer or float representing the base length of the triangular prism.
- `h` is a positive integer or float representing the height of the triangular prism's triangular face.
- `l` is a positive integer or float representing the length of the prism.

After executing the function body, the function returns the value of `(b * h / 2) * l`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, and return the volume of the triangular prism calculated using the formula `(b * h / 2) * l`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated using the formula `(b * h / 2) * l`.**
