Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b` (base length of the triangular prism), `h` (height of the triangular prism's triangular face), and `l` (length of the prism). It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\). There are no edge cases or missing functionality noted in the provided code.**

This summary focuses on the actual actions performed by the code and does not include any redundant or irrelevant annotations. The function's purpose is clear: it computes the volume of a triangular prism given its dimensions.
