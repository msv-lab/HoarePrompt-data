Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \(\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The function takes three parameters: `b` (base), `h` (height of the triangle), and `l` (length of the prism), and returns the calculated volume. There are no apparent edge cases or errors in the logic that would cause the function to fail for any valid input. Therefore, the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
