Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the formula for finding the volume of a triangular prism, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `b` (base length of the triangular prism), `h` (height of the triangular prism's triangular face), and `l` (length of the prism), and calculates the volume using the formula \((b * h / 2) * l\). There are no edge cases or missing functionality noted in the provided code. Therefore, the code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case.
