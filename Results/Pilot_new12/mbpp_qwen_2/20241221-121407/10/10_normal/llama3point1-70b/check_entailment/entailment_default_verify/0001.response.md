Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(b, h, l)` implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The output hints confirm that the function accepts the required parameters and calculates the volume correctly without any edge cases or missing functionality noted. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the problem description.
