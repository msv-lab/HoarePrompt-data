Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is given by \(\text{Volume} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\right) \times \text{length}\). Here, `b` represents the base length of the triangular prism, `h` represents the height of the triangular prism's triangular face, and `l` represents the length of the prism. The function returns \((b * h / 2) * l\), which matches the formula exactly. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description in all cases.
