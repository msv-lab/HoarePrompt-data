Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The function takes three parameters: `b` (base length of the triangular prism), `h` (height of the triangular prism's triangular face), and `l` (length of the prism), and returns the calculated volume. Since the problem description and the function itself match perfectly, and there are no edge cases or missing functionality mentioned in the output hints, the program is correct for every potential case.
