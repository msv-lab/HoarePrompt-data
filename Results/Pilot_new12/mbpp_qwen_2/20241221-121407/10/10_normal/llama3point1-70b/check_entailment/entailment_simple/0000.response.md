Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \left( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \right) \times \text{length} \]

In the annotated program, the function `func_1` takes three parameters: `b` (base length), `h` (height of the triangular face), and `l` (length of the prism). It returns the volume by evaluating the expression:

\[ \left( \frac{b \times h}{2} \right) \times l \]

This matches exactly with the formula for the volume of a triangular prism. Therefore, the program always does what the problem description asks for, making it correct.
