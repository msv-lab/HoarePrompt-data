Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \(\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). The annotations confirm that the inputs `b`, `h`, and `l` are positive integers or floats, ensuring that the formula will be applied correctly under the assumption of valid input. Since the function logic aligns with the problem description and there are no logical errors indicated by the annotations, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
