Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the appropriate formula and the provided test cases validate its correctness. The output hints further confirm that the function handles the expected inputs (non-negative floating point numbers) and correctly implements the formula. Since the program meets the problem description and the provided test cases and output hints do not indicate any issues, the original assessment is accurate.
