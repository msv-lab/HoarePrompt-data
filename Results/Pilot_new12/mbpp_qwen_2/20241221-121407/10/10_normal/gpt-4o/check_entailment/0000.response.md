Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \]

The function first computes the area of the triangular base (`base_area = 0.5 * base * height`) and then multiplies this by the length of the prism to get the volume. The given test cases also confirm the correctness of the function:

- For `func_1(10, 8, 6)`, the volume is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 8 \times 6 = 240 \).
- For `func_1(3, 2, 2)`, the volume is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 2 \times 2 = 6 \).
- For `func_1(1, 2, 1)`, the volume is \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 2 \times 1 = 1 \).

Since the function appears to work correctly for the given examples and the formula used is mathematically sound, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
