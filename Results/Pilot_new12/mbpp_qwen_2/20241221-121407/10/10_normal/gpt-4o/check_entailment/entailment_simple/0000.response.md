Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly based on the provided problem description. The function takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, which are expected to be non-negative floating-point numbers. The formula used to calculate the volume is accurate:

1. It first computes the area of the triangular base using the formula \( \text{base\_area} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \).
2. Then, it multiplies this area by the length to get the volume of the prism.

The provided test cases also correctly validate the function with different sets of inputs, ensuring that the function behaves as expected for various scenarios. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
