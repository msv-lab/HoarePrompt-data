Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly using the formula for the area of a triangle and then multiplying by the length. The assertions provided cover various cases, including when the base, height, or length is zero, which results in a volume of zero. Since the code handles these cases correctly and the provided output hints align with the code, the program is correct for every potential case described in the problem.
