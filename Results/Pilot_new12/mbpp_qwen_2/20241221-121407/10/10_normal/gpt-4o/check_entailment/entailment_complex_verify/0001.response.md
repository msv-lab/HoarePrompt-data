Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The provided assertions verify the correctness of the function for different sets of inputs, and the annotations indicate that the function handles the inputs as non-negative floating point numbers. Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and the annotations support its correctness, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is maintained.
