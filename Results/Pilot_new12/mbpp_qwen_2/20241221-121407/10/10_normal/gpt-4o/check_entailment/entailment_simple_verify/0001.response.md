Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The annotated version confirms that the inputs (base, height, and length) are non-negative floating point numbers, which aligns with the mathematical formula and the provided test cases. Since the function passes all the assertions and the formula is mathematically sound, the program meets the problem description and is therefore correct.
