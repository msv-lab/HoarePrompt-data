Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The output hints confirm that the function handles the required parameters appropriately, including edge cases where one or more of the parameters are zero. The assertions provided also validate the correctness of the function across different scenarios. Since the program meets the problem description and the provided output hints align with the expected behavior, the original assessment is maintained as True.
