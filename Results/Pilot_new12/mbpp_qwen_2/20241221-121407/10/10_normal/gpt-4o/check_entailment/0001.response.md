Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The given test cases cover different scenarios:

1. `func_1(10, 8, 6)` returns `240`, which is calculated as \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \times 8 \times 6 = 240 \).
2. `func_1(3, 2, 2)` returns `6`, which is calculated as \( \frac{1}{2} \times 3 \times 2 \times 2 = 6 \).
3. `func_1(1, 2, 1)` returns `1`, which is calculated as \( \frac{1}{2} \times 1 \times 2 \times 1 = 1 \).

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the formula used is mathematically sound, the function should handle any valid input correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
