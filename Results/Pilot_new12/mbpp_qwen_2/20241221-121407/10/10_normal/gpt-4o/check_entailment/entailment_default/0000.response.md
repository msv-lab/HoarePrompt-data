Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to calculate the volume of a triangular prism. The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, and calculates the volume using the formula for the area of a triangle (0.5 * base * height) multiplied by the length. The provided assertions cover various cases, including when the base, height, or length is zero, which results in a volume of zero. Since the code handles all the necessary calculations and the provided examples and assertions are consistent with the problem description, the code is correct for every potential case.
