Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The annotations further clarify that the function accepts non-negative floating-point numbers for `base`, `height`, and `length`, and correctly computes the volume using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The test cases provided also confirm the correctness of the function. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
