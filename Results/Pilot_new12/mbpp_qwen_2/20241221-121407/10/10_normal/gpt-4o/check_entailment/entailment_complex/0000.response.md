Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the calculation for the volume of a triangular prism. According to the problem description, the function should calculate the volume of a triangular prism using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\right) \times \text{length} \]

The function `func_1` follows this formula by first calculating the area of the triangular base (`base_area = 0.5 * base * height`) and then multiplying it by the length of the prism (`volume = base_area * length`). The function returns the computed volume, which is exactly what the problem description requires. Additionally, the function handles valid inputs as specified, with all parameters being non-negative floating point numbers. Since the function meets all the requirements of the problem description without any omissions or deviations, the correctness of the program is **True**.
