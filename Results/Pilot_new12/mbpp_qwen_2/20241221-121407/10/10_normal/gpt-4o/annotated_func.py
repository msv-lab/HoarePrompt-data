#State of the program right berfore the function call: base, height, and length are non-negative floating point numbers.
def func_1(base, height, length):
    base_area = 0.5 * base * height
    volume = base_area * length
    return volume
    #The program returns volume which is base_area multiplied by length, where base_area is 0.5 * base * height
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, all of which are non-negative floating point numbers. It calculates the volume of a prism using the formula for the area of a triangle (base_area = 0.5 * base * height) and then multiplies this area by the length. The function returns the calculated volume. Potential edge cases include when any of the parameters are zero, in which case the volume will also be zero. There are no missing functionalities in the provided code.
