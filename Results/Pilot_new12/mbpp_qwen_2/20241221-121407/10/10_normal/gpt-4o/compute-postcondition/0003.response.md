The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. All three parameters are non-negative floating point numbers. The function calculates the base area using the formula \( \text{base\_area} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \) and then multiplies it by `length` to get the volume. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three non-negative floating point numbers `base`, `height`, and `length`, calculate the volume using the base area and length, and return the volume.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `base`, `height`, and `length`, all non-negative floating point numbers, and returns the volume calculated as base_area multiplied by length, where base_area is 0.5 * base * height.**
