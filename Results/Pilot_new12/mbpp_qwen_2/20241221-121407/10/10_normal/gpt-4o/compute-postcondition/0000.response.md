`base_area` is assigned the value of 0.5 * base * height. The base and height are non-negative floating point numbers, so `base_area` will also be a non-negative floating point number calculated as half of the product of `base` and `height`. The states of the other variables (`base` and `height`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`base_area` is 0.5 * `base` * `height`, `base` is a non-negative floating point number, `height` is a non-negative floating point number**
