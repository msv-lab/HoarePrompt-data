#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string consisting of parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}').
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `stack` is either empty or contains elements such that each element matches the corresponding opening bracket of a character in `expr` when the character is in `matching_pairs`. If a character is in `matching_pairs.values()`, the stack contains its previous elements (if any) plus the character. If a character is in `matching_pairs`, the function returns `False` if the condition `stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]` is true. Otherwise, the function does not return anything and continues with the rest of the program.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True if the stack is empty, or False if the stack is not empty after processing all characters in `expr`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` consisting of parentheses (`(`, `)`, `[`, `]`), and curly braces (`{`, `}`) and checks if these symbols are properly nested. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening symbols encountered. For each character in `expr`, if it is an opening symbol, it is pushed onto the stack. If it is a closing symbol, the function checks whether the stack is empty or if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening symbol; if not, it immediately returns `False`. After processing all characters, the function returns `True` only if the stack is empty, indicating that all symbols were properly nested; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include empty strings, strings with unbalanced symbols, and strings with mismatched symbols. The function correctly handles these cases as described.
