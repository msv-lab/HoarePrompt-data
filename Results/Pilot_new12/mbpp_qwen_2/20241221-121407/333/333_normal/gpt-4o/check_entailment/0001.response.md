Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle expressions with characters other than parentheses, brackets, and braces. For example, consider the input `func_1('a{()}[{}]b')`. The program should return `False` because it contains non-matching characters, but the current implementation will not detect this issue. To fix this, you need to add a check for non-pair characters before pushing them onto the stack. Here is a modified version of the function:

```python
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        else:
            # Non-pair character found
            return False
    return stack == []
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify that the expression `a{()}[{}]b` is not balanced.
