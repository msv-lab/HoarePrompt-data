You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
    return stack == []


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle expressions with characters other than parentheses, brackets, and braces. For example, consider the input `func_1('a{()}[{}]b')`. The program should return `False` because it contains non-matching characters, but the current implementation will not detect this issue. To fix this, you need to add a check for non-pair characters before pushing them onto the stack. Here is a modified version of the function:

```python
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        else:
            # Non-pair character found
            return False
    return stack == []
```

With this modification, the function will correctly identify that the expression `a{()}[{}]b` is not balanced.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` consisting of parentheses (`(`, `)`, `[`, `]`), and curly braces (`{`, `}`) and checks if these symbols are properly nested. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening symbols encountered. For each character in `expr`, if it is an opening symbol, it is pushed onto the stack. If it is a closing symbol, the function checks whether the stack is empty or if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening symbol; if not, it immediately returns `False`. After processing all characters, the function returns `True` only if the stack is empty, indicating that all symbols were properly nested; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include empty strings, strings with unbalanced symbols, and strings with mismatched symbols. The function correctly handles these cases as described.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
