Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`. The function uses a stack to ensure that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket. The annotations further confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling both balanced and unbalanced expressions correctly. The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the correct functionality of the function. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
