Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a given string containing parentheses (`(`, `)`), square brackets (`[`, `]`), and curly braces (`{`, `}`) is balanced. Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks if the given expression (string) is balanced. An expression is considered balanced if all types of brackets are properly nested and matched.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - A `stack` is used to keep track of opening brackets encountered.
   - For each character in the input string:
     - If it's an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, `{`), it is pushed onto the stack.
     - If it's a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, `}`), the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening bracket. If either condition is true, the function returns `False`.
   - After processing all characters, the function returns `True` only if the stack is empty, indicating that all symbols were properly nested; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - The program handles empty strings correctly by returning `True` (since no unbalanced symbols exist).
   - The program correctly identifies unbalanced expressions and returns `False` in those cases.
   - The program processes the entire string without causing any runtime errors under the assumption of valid input.

Given the above points, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if the given expression is balanced, thus meeting the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
