Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`. The function uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and ensures that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket. 

The examples provided also demonstrate the correct functionality of the function:
- `'{()}[{}]'` returns `True` because all brackets are properly matched.
- `'{()}[{]'` returns `False` because the last bracket `}` does not match with any opening bracket.
- `'{()}[{}][]({})'` returns `True` because all brackets are properly matched.

Given that the function works correctly for the provided examples and the logic appears sound for handling balanced expressions, there does not appear to be any case where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
