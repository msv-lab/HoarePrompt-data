Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a function `func_1` that checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses (`()`, `[]`, `{}`). The code uses a stack to keep track of opening symbols and ensures that each closing symbol matches the most recent unmatched opening symbol. The function correctly returns `True` if the stack is empty after processing the entire expression, indicating that all symbols are properly nested. The examples provided in the problem description and the output hints confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Additionally, the code handles edge cases such as empty strings and strings with unbalanced symbols, making it correct for the described problem.
