Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given program correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression containing parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces is balanced. Here's why:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes an empty stack (`stack = []`) and a dictionary (`matching_pairs`) that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.

2. **Iterating through the expression**: It iterates through each character in the input string (`expr`). For each character:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (value in `matching_pairs`), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (key in `matching_pairs`), it checks if the stack is empty or if the top of the stack does not match the expected opening bracket. If either condition is true, the function immediately returns `False`.

3. **Final check**: After processing all characters, the function returns `True` if the stack is empty (meaning all brackets were matched correctly), or `False` otherwise.

Given this logic, the function correctly identifies whether the expression is balanced according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
