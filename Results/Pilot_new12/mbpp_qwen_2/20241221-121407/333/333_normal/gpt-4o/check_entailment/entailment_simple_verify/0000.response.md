Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and annotations. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at different points, showing how the function uses a stack to ensure that each closing bracket matches the most recent unmatched opening bracket. The examples provided also demonstrate the correct functionality of the function. Since the function handles all cases correctly according to the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, the original assessment is maintained as **True**.
