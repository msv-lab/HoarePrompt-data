Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understanding the State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - The `stack` either is empty or contains elements such that each popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket of `char` when `char` is in `matching_pairs`.
   - If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, the stack remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each character `char` in `expr`.

3. **Effect of One Iteration:**
   - If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, the corresponding opening bracket is popped from the stack (if it exists).
   - If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, the stack remains unchanged.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - For the loop to continue, the next character `char` in `expr` must be considered.
   - Therefore, the loop will continue as long as there are characters left to process in `expr`.

5. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - The `stack` will remain in its current state if `char` is not in `matching_pairs`.
   - If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, the stack will change based on the pop operation.

Given these points, let's summarize the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:

- Since we do not know the exact character `char` for the next iteration, we assume it could be any character in `expr`.
- If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, the stack remains unchanged.
- If `char` is in `matching_pairs`, the stack will adjust based on the pop operation, but we do not know the exact new state without knowing the specific `char`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will depend on the next character `char` in `expr`. However, we can generally say that the stack will either remain unchanged or adjust based on the pop operation.

**State: **`stack` is either empty or contains elements such that each popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket of `char` when `char` is in `matching_pairs`. If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, the stack remains unchanged.**
