According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `expr`. The loop will execute if `expr` contains at least one character. Before the loop starts, the stack is empty (`[]`), and `expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. The variable `matching_pairs` is a dictionary that defines the matching pairs of characters.

For the loop to be executed, `expr` must contain at least one character. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`stack` is [], `expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces that must have at least one character, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'**
