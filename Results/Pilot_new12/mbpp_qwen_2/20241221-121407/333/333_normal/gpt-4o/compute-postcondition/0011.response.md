Postcondition: ***`stack` is either empty or contains elements such that each popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket of `char` when `char` is in `matching_pairs`. If `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, the stack remains unchanged.***

Explanation:
- If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, the if part ensures that `char` is added to `stack`.
- If `char` is not in `matching_pairs.values()`, the else part ensures that the operation does not alter the state of `stack` (i.e., it remains unchanged).

Given the nature of the if and else parts, the overall postcondition focuses on the behavior of the stack under both scenarios, ensuring the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition.
