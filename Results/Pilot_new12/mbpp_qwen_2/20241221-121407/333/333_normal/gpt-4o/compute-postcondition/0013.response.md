The code `stack.append(char)` appends the variable `char` to the list `stack`. Given the initial state where `stack` is either empty or contains elements such that each popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket of `char` when `char` is in `matching_pairs`, and if `char` is not in `matching_pairs`, the stack remains unchanged, the code will append `char` to `stack`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact contents of `stack` or the value of `char`, the only thing we can say for certain is that `char` is added to `stack`.

Output State: **`stack` contains its previous elements (if any) plus `char`.**
