The code initializes an empty list named `stack`. The initial state of `expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. After executing the code, the stack is initialized but no changes are made to `expr`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `stack` and retains the initial value of `expr`.

Output State: **`stack` is [], `expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.**
