The code creates a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets. This dictionary does not modify the existing variables `stack` or `expr`. Therefore, the `stack` remains an empty list `[]`, and `expr` remains a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.

Output State: **`stack` is [], `expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces; `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}**
