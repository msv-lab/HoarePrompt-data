Postcondition: **`stack` is an empty list, `expr` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces with at least one character, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', the character `char` is in the values of `matching_pairs`, and the current value of `char` is in `matching_pairs`. After the if condition, either the stack is still empty or the popped value from the stack is not equal to the corresponding opening bracket of `char` as per the `matching_pairs` dictionary.**
