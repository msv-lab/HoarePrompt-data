Output State: **`stack` is either empty or contains elements such that each element matches the corresponding opening bracket of a character in `expr` when the character is in `matching_pairs`. If a character is in `matching_pairs.values()`, the stack contains its previous elements (if any) plus the character. If a character is in `matching_pairs`, the function returns `False` if the condition `stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]` is true. Otherwise, the function does not return anything and continues with the rest of the program.**
