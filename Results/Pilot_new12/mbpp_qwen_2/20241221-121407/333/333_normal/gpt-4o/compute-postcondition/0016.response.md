Postcondition: ***`stack` is either empty or contains elements such that each popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket of `char` when `char` is in `matching_pairs`. If the condition `stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]` is true, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything and continues with the rest of the program.***
