The function `func_1` accepts a string `expr` consisting of parentheses (`(`, `)`, `[`, `]`), and curly braces (`{`, `}`) and checks if these symbols are properly nested. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening symbols encountered. For each character in `expr`, if it is an opening symbol, it is pushed onto the stack. If it is a closing symbol, the function checks whether the stack is empty or if the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening symbol; if not, it immediately returns `False`. After processing all characters, the function returns `True` only if the stack is empty, indicating that all symbols were properly nested; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include empty strings, strings with unbalanced symbols, and strings with mismatched symbols. The function correctly handles these cases as described.
