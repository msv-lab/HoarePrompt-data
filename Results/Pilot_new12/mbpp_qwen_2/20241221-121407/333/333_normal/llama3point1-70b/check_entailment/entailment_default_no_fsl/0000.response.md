Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression with parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces is balanced. The function uses a stack to match opening and closing brackets. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are correctly matched. The code handles all possible cases where brackets are not correctly matched, including unbalanced and unclosed brackets. The output hints also accurately describe the functionality of the code. Therefore, the program works correctly for every potential case based on the problem description.
