Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. It uses a stack to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The function handles all potential cases as described in the output hints, ensuring that the stack is empty at the end of the iteration if all brackets are correctly matched. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
