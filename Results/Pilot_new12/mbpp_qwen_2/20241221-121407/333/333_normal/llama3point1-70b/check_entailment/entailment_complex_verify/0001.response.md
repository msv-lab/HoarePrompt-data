Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the annotated version. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to the parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`. The annotations clearly describe the state of the program at different stages and validate the logic implemented in the function. The function initializes an empty stack and uses it to match opening and closing brackets. It correctly handles all cases where brackets are not properly matched, ensuring that the stack is empty at the end of the iteration only if all brackets are correctly matched. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
