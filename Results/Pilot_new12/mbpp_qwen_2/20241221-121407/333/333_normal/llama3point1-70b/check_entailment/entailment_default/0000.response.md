Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses ('()', '{}', '[]'). It uses a stack to ensure that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. The code handles all potential cases where brackets are not correctly matched, including unbalanced and unclosed brackets. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are correctly matched, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code follows the requirements accurately. The function correctly identifies whether the expression is balanced or not for every potential case.
