Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to the parentheses `()`, square brackets `[]`, and curly braces `{}`. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each opening bracket is properly closed in the correct order. The function handles all potential cases as described:

- It correctly identifies and pushes opening brackets onto the stack.
- It checks if the closing bracket matches the last opening bracket on the stack.
- It ensures that the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, indicating that all opening brackets were properly closed.

Since the function correctly implements the logic for checking balanced expressions, and no potential cases have been found where it fails to work as expected, the program is correct.
