Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python function `func_1(expression)` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses (`(`, `)`), square brackets (`[`, `]`), and curly braces (`{`, `}`). Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Stack Initialization**: A stack is initialized to keep track of the opening brackets encountered.
2. **Bracket Mapping**: A dictionary `brackets` maps each type of opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket.
3. **Iterating Through Expression**: The function iterates through each character in the input `expression`:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., one of the keys in the `brackets` dictionary), it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., one of the values in the `brackets` dictionary), the function checks if the stack is empty or if the top element of the stack does not match the expected opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. **Final Check**: After processing all characters in the expression, the function checks if the stack is empty. An empty stack indicates that all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, hence the expression is balanced. Otherwise, the stack contains unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.

This implementation ensures that the function correctly identifies whether the given expression is balanced according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
