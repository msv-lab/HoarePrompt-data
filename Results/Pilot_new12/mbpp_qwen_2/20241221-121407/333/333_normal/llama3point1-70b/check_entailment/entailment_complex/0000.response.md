Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic to check if a given expression containing parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}') is balanced. Here's why:

1. **Stack Usage**: The program uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. When an opening bracket is found, it is pushed onto the stack. This ensures that we can match each opening bracket with its corresponding closing bracket later in the string.
   
2. **Matching Closing Brackets**: When a closing bracket is encountered, the program checks whether the top of the stack contains the corresponding opening bracket. If the stack is empty (meaning there's no corresponding opening bracket) or the top of the stack doesn't match the current closing bracket, the expression is immediately determined to be unbalanced, and the function returns `False`.

3. **Final Stack Check**: After iterating through the entire expression, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets were properly matched and closed, and the function returns `True`. If the stack is not empty, it means there were unmatched opening brackets, and the function returns `False`.

Given these points, the program consistently checks if the expression is balanced according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
