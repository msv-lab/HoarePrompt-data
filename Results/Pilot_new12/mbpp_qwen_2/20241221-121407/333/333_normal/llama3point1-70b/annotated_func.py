#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string consisting of parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}').
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is an empty list if all brackets are correctly matched and closed, or contains the unmatched opening brackets, and `brackets` is a predefined dictionary mapping '(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'
    return not stack
    #`The program returns True if all brackets in the string 'expression' are correctly matched and closed, or False otherwise`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` consisting of parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}'). It uses a stack to check if all the brackets in the string are correctly matched and closed. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are correctly matched, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles all possible cases where brackets are not correctly matched, including unbalanced and unclosed brackets.
