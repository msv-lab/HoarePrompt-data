The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` consisting of parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}'). It uses a stack to check if all the brackets in the string are correctly matched and closed. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are correctly matched, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles all possible cases where brackets are not correctly matched, including unbalanced and unclosed brackets.
