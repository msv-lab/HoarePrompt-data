Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is a list representing the stack of opened brackets, and `char` is the next character in `expression`. If the top element of the stack matches `char`, the stack is updated by popping the top element. Otherwise, the function returns False.***
