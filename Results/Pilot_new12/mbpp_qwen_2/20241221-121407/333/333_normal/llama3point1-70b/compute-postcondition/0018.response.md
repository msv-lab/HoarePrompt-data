To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop logic step by step.

### Given Information:
- `expression` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
- `stack` is a list representing the stack of opened brackets.
- If `char` is a closing bracket and matches the top element of the stack, the top element is popped from the stack.
- If `char` is not a valid closing bracket or does not match the top element of the stack, the function returns `False`.

### Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `expression` is a non-empty string.
- `stack` is a list representing the stack of opened brackets.

### Loop Logic:
The loop iterates over each character (`char`) in the `expression`. The condition inside the loop checks if `char` is a closing bracket and if it matches the top element of the `stack`. If it matches, the top element is popped; otherwise, the function returns `False`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Current State**: 
   - `expression` is a non-empty string.
   - `stack` is a list representing the stack of opened brackets.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are characters left in `expression` and the `stack` is not empty (indicating an ongoing matching process).

3. **Next Character**:
   - The next character (`char`) is taken from the `expression`.
   - If `char` is a closing bracket, it must match the top element of the `stack` for the loop to continue.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - If `char` is a closing bracket and matches the top element of the `stack`, the top element is popped from the `stack`.
   - If `char` is a closing bracket but does not match the top element of the `stack`, the function returns `False`.
   - If `char` is an opening bracket, it is added to the `stack`.

5. **Condition for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
     - There must be at least one more character in `expression`.
     - The `stack` must not be empty (indicating that there is an open bracket to match with a closing bracket).

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, the `expression` must still contain at least one more character, and the `stack` must not be empty.

### Final State:
- `expression` must still contain at least one more character.
- `stack` must not be empty.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`expression` must still contain at least one more character, `stack` must not be empty**.
