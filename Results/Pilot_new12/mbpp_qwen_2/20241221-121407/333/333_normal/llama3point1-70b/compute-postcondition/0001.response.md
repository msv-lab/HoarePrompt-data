The code defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps opening parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces to their corresponding closing characters. However, this code does not alter the values of any variables, it only initializes a new dictionary. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`expression` is a string consisting of parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}'); `stack` is an empty list; `brackets` is a dictionary mapping '(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'.**
