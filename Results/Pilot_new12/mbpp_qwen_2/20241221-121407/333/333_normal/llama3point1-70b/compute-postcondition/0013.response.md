The code `stack.append(char)` appends the value of `char` to the end of the list `stack`. Given the initial state, the value of `char` is the next character in the string `expression`. Therefore, the `stack` list will have its last element updated to the current `char`.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is a list representing the stack of opened brackets with the last element being `char`, and `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
