Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` consisting of parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}'). It uses a stack to check if all the brackets in the string are correctly matched and closed. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are correctly matched, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The function handles all possible cases where brackets are not correctly matched, including unbalanced and unclosed brackets.**

This summary covers the following aspects:
1. The function accepts a string `expression`.
2. It checks if all brackets in the string are correctly matched and closed.
3. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets.
4. It returns `True` if the stack is empty at the end, indicating all brackets are correctly matched.
5. It returns `False` if the stack is not empty or if there are unmatched closing brackets.
6. It handles all edge cases, including unbalanced and unclosed brackets.
