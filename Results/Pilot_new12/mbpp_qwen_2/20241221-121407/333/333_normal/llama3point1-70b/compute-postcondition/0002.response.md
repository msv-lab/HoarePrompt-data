Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables and Their Initial States**:
   - The loop iterates over each character in the `expression`.
   - The initial state of `expression` is a string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
   - The `stack` is initially an empty list.
   - The `brackets` dictionary is predefined and maps opening brackets to their corresponding closing brackets.

2. **Determine the Conditions for the Loop to Execute**:
   - The loop will execute as long as there are characters in the `expression` to iterate over.
   - The `expression` must not be an empty string for the loop to start and execute at least once.

3. **Adjust the States for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to start executing, `expression` must contain at least one character.

Based on this analysis, we need to adjust the state such that `expression` is not empty.

**State:**
- `expression` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
- `stack` is an empty list.
- `brackets` is a predefined dictionary mapping '(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'.

So, the final state to be adjusted is:

**State: **`expression` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is a predefined dictionary mapping '(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'**.
