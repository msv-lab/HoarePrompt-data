Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is a list representing the stack of opened brackets, and `char` is the next character in `expression`. If the top element of the stack does not match `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the stack is updated by popping the top element.***
