The code `stack.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the end of the list `stack`. Since `stack` was not empty in the initial state, appending a character to it will add one more element to the list. The value of `expression` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.

Output State: **`expression` must still contain at least one more character, `stack` is now a list with one additional element (the last element is `char`)**
