Postcondition: ***`expression` must still contain at least one more character, `stack` must not be empty. If `char` is found in `brackets.values()` and the popped element from `stack` does not match the corresponding closing bracket, the function returns False. Otherwise, `stack` becomes empty after popping an element.***
