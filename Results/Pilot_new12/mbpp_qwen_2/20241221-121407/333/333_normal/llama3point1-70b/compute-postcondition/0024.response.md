Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is an empty list if all brackets are correctly matched and closed, or contains the unmatched opening brackets, and `brackets` is a predefined dictionary mapping '(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through each character in the `expression`.
- If the character is an opening bracket (i.e., a key in the `brackets` dictionary), it is pushed onto the `stack`.
- If the character is a closing bracket (i.e., a value in the `brackets` dictionary) and the `stack` is not empty and the top of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket, the top element is popped from the stack.
- If the character is a closing bracket and does not match the top element of the stack, the function returns `False`.

After the loop completes:
- If all opening brackets are correctly matched and closed, the `stack` will be empty.
- If there are any unmatched opening brackets left in the `stack`, the function returns `False` because they were not properly closed.

Thus, the final state of the `stack` will be empty if all brackets are correctly matched and closed, or it will contain the unmatched opening brackets otherwise.
