Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `expression` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
   - `stack` is a list representing the stack of opened brackets.
   - `brackets` is a predefined dictionary mapping '(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'.
   - The loop iterates over each character (`char`) in `expression`.

2. **Loop Body Analysis:**
   - If `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary, `stack` is updated to contain `[char]`.
     - This means that an opening bracket is encountered, and it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If `char` is a value in the `brackets` dictionary and the last popped element from `stack` matches `char`, no changes occur.
     - This means that a closing bracket is encountered, and it should match the last opened bracket (the top of the stack).

3. **Determine the State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - We need to consider what happens to the `stack` and the current `char` as we move to the next iteration of the loop.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `char` was processed according to the rules above.

Since the loop will proceed to the next character in `expression` for the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

- The `stack` might have changed based on the processing of the previous `char`.
- The `char` will now be the next character in `expression`.

4. **State Adjustments:**
   - `expression` remains the same because the string does not change during the loop execution.
   - `stack` could either remain the same or be updated depending on the current `char`.
   - `char` will be the next character in `expression`.

Given that the loop has just finished processing the last `char` and moved to the next one, let's summarize the new state:

- `expression` remains the same.
- `stack` could be empty (if all brackets were matched) or could have the current `char` added to it if it was an opening bracket.
- `char` will be the next character in `expression`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is a list representing the stack of opened brackets, and `char` is the next character in `expression`.**
