Postcondition: ***`expression` must still contain at least one more character, `stack` must not be empty. If `char` is found in `brackets.values()`, `stack` is pushed with `char`. Otherwise, if `char` is a closing bracket and matches the last element popped from `stack`, `stack` becomes empty. If the condition is not met, the function returns False.***
