Postcondition: ***`expression` is a non-empty string consisting of parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is a list representing the stack of opened brackets, and `brackets` is a predefined dictionary mapping '(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']. If `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary, `stack` is updated to contain `[char]`. If `char` is a value in the `brackets` dictionary and the last popped element from `stack` matches `char`, no changes occur. Otherwise, the same conditions as the if part apply, meaning `stack` is updated to contain `[char]` if `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary.***
