Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as inputs and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` found within the tuple `tup`. 

Here's why it is correct:

- The function iterates over each element in the list `lst`.
- For each element in `lst`, it uses the `count()` method of the tuple `tup` to find out how many times that element appears in the tuple.
- It then sums up these counts using the `sum()` function.
- Finally, it returns this sum.

This logic accurately reflects the requirement to count the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple and return the total count. Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
