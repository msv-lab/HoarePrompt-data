Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` is designed to return the sum of counts of each element in `lst` found within the tuple `tup`, rather than returning a dictionary that maps each element to its respective count. The output hints also confirm this behavior by stating that the function calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` found within the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description, which requires a dictionary or another suitable data structure showing the count of each element from `lst` in `tup`.
