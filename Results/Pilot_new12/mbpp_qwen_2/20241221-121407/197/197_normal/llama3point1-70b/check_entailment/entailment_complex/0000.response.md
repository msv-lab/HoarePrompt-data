Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It then iterates over each element in `lst` and uses the `count` method of the tuple to find how many times each element appears in `tup`. The counts are summed up using a generator expression, and this sum is returned as the result. 

The function handles all elements in `lst`, including duplicates and non-matching elements, ensuring that the sum of counts is accurately computed. Specifically:
- It counts the occurrences of each element from `lst` within `tup`.
- If an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`, its count is considered as 0, which is correctly handled by the `count` method.

Therefore, the program always meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
