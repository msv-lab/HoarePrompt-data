You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` attempts to count the occurrences of elements from the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. However, it only returns the total count of all elements from `lst` found in `tup`, rather than returning a dictionary or a similar structure that maps each element from `lst` to its respective count in `tup`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
tup = (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2)
lst = [1, 2, 5]
```
The expected output would be a dictionary like `{1: 2, 2: 2, 5: 0}` because `1` and `2` appear twice in the tuple, and `5` does not appear at all. However, the provided function will simply return `4` because it sums up all occurrences of elements from `lst` in `tup`.

To meet the problem description, the function should return a dictionary or another suitable data structure that shows the count of each element from `lst` in `tup`. Here is an example of how the function could be corrected:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    result = {element: tup.count(element) for element in lst}
    return result
```

This corrected version will produce the expected output for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` found within the tuple `tup`. If an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. The function handles all elements in `lst`, including duplicates and non-matching elements, ensuring that the sum of counts is accurately computed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
