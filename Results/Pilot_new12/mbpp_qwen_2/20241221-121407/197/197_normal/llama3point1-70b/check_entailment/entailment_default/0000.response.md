Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as inputs and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` found within the tuple `tup`. The expression `(tup.count(element) for element in lst)` generates a generator that yields the count of each element in `lst` within `tup`. Summing these counts using `sum()` provides the total occurrence of all elements of `lst` in `tup`. The code handles all elements in `lst`, including duplicates and non-matching elements, and ensures that the sum of counts is accurately computed. The output hints align with the code's behavior, and no potential cases are identified where the program would fail to meet the requirements.
