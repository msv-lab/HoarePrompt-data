Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and it counts the occurrence of each element in `lst` within `tup`. The use of a generator expression inside the `sum` function iterates over each element in `lst` and sums up their occurrences in `tup`. Since the annotated version aligns with the original assessment and there are no contradictions or issues identified, the program remains correct according to the problem description.
