Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and it counts the occurrence of each element in `lst` within `tup`. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each element in `lst` and count its occurrences in `tup`. This approach correctly counts the occurrences of each element in `lst` within `tup`.

Since the function works correctly for all potential cases (it handles all elements in `lst` and counts their occurrences in `tup`), and there are no edge cases or examples where the function fails, the program is correct.
