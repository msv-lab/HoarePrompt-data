Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the requirement is to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple and return a suitable data structure (like a dictionary) that maps each element from the list to its respective count in the tuple. However, the provided function `func_1` returns the total count of all elements from the list found in the tuple using `sum()`, which does not meet the requirement. The annotated version correctly describes the behavior of the current implementation, which sums up the counts instead of returning a mapping. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
