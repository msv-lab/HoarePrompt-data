Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` attempts to count the occurrences of elements from the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. However, it only returns the total count of all elements from `lst` found in `tup`, rather than returning a dictionary or a similar structure that maps each element from `lst` to its respective count in `tup`.

For example, consider the following input:
```
tup = (1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2)
lst = [1, 2, 5]
```
The expected output would be a dictionary like `{1: 2, 2: 2, 5: 0}` because `1` and `2` appear twice in the tuple, and `5` does not appear at all. However, the provided function will simply return `4` because it sums up all occurrences of elements from `lst` in `tup`.

To meet the problem description, the function should return a dictionary or another suitable data structure that shows the count of each element from `lst` in `tup`. Here is an example of how the function could be corrected:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    result = {element: tup.count(element) for element in lst}
    return result
```

This corrected version will produce the expected output for the given problem description.
