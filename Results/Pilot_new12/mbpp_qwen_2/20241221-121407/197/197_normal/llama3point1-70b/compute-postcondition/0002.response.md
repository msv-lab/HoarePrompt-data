Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` found within the tuple `tup`. If an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. The function handles all elements in `lst`, including duplicates and non-matching elements, ensuring that the sum of counts is accurately computed.**

This summary covers the actual functionality of the code, including handling edge cases such as elements in `lst` that do not appear in `tup`, where their count is treated as 0.
