The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`. It calculates and returns the sum of counts of each element in `lst` found within the tuple `tup`. If an element in `lst` is not present in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. The function handles all elements in `lst`, including duplicates and non-matching elements, ensuring that the sum of counts is accurately computed.
