Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list of elements `elements`, and returns the total count of occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`. The function iterates through each element in the `elements` list and counts its occurrences in the `tup` tuple by using the `count` method. The function sums these counts and returns the total sum. Potential edge cases include: (1) If `tup` is an empty tuple, the function will return 0 since no elements can be counted. (2) If `elements` is an empty list, the function will also return 0 because there are no elements to count. (3) If any element in `elements` is not present in `tup`, the count for that element will be 0, and it will not affect the final sum.**
