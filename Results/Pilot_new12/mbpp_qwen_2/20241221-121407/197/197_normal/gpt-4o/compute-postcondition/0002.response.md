The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `elements`, which is a list of elements to count in the tuple. The function returns `count`, which is the sum of occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list of elements `elements`, and return the total count of occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`.
