Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to count the occurrences of all elements in the given list (`elements`) within the provided tuple (`tup`). 

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `elements` (a list). This matches the problem description that states the function should take a tuple and a list as inputs.

2. **Logic**: The function uses a generator expression `tup.count(element) for element in elements` to count the occurrences of each element in the `elements` list within the `tup`. It then sums these counts using `sum()`, which gives the total number of occurrences of the specified elements in the tuple.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions in the code validate the function's behavior with different inputs:
   - The first assertion checks that `func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b'])` returns 3, which is correct because there are 2 'a's and 1 'b' in the tuple.
   - The second assertion checks that `func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7])` returns 6, which is correct because there are 3 '1's, 2 '4's, and 1 '7' in the tuple.
   - The third assertion checks that `func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2])` returns 2, which is correct because there is 1 '1' and 1 '2' in the tuple.

Since the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and passes all the provided test cases, the function is correct.
