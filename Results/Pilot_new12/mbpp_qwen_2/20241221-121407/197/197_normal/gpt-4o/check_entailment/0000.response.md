Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list `elements` within the tuple `tup`. The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count how many times each element in `elements` appears in `tup`. This approach ensures that all elements in `elements` are counted correctly, regardless of their order or repetition in the tuple.

Given the provided test cases:
1. `assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3` - This is correct because there are 2 'a's and 1 'b' in the tuple, totaling 3 occurrences.
2. `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6` - This is correct because there are 3 '1's, 2 '4's, and 1 '7' in the tuple, totaling 6 occurrences.
3. `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2` - This is correct because there are 1 '1' and 1 '2' in the tuple, totaling 2 occurrences.

Since the function works correctly for the provided test cases and the logic seems sound for counting occurrences, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness is True.
