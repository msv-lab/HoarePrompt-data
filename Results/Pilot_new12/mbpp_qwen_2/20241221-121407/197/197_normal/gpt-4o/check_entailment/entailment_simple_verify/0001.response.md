Final: **True**

Reasoning: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list within the given tuple. The annotations support the correctness of the function in handling different scenarios, such as tuples with repeated elements, tuples with multiple distinct elements, and tuples with a subset of the elements to count. The function uses a generator expression to sum up the counts of each element in the tuple, ensuring accurate results for all provided test cases. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
