Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the `elements` list within the given tuple `tup`. The provided assertions and the logical structure of the function (using a generator expression inside `sum` to aggregate counts) ensure that the function meets the requirements of the problem description. The test cases given also validate the function's correctness under various scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
