Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. It accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and returns the total count of occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `elements` (a list). This matches the expected inputs as described in the problem statement.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to iterate over each element in `elements` and count its occurrences in `tup` using the `count` method. The sum of these counts is then returned. This approach ensures that the function accurately calculates the total number of times each element in `elements` appears in `tup`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Tuple**: If `tup` is an empty tuple, the function will return 0 because no elements can be counted. This is handled correctly.
   - **Empty List**: If `elements` is an empty list, the function will also return 0 because there are no elements to count. This is also handled correctly.
   - **Elements Not Present**: If any element in `elements` is not present in `tup`, the count for that element will be 0, and it will not affect the final sum. This is handled correctly as well.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, and thus the program is correct.
