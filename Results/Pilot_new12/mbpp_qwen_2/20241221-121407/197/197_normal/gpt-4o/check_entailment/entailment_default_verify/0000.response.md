Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the `elements` list within the `tup` tuple. The provided test cases and the output hints confirm that the function handles various scenarios, including edge cases such as an empty tuple or an empty list of elements, returning 0 in such cases. The logic of using a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count occurrences is sound and works as expected based on the problem description and the provided examples.
