Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list within the given tuple. Let's verify this by considering various potential cases:

1. **Case with repeated elements**: The function correctly handles repeated elements as demonstrated in the first assertion (`('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd')` with `['a', 'b']`).
2. **Case with multiple distinct elements**: The function works as expected in the second assertion (`(1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4)` with `[1, 4, 7]`).
3. **Case with a subset of the tuple elements**: The third assertion (`(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6)` with `[1, 2]`) correctly counts the occurrences of the specified elements.

The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the `elements` list and sums up their counts in the tuple using the `count` method. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases described in the problem. Therefore, the provided function meets the requirements for every potential case.
