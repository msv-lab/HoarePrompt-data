Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It counts the total occurrences of each element in the `elements` list within the `tup` tuple and returns the sum of these counts. The code handles the following cases:
1. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the function will return 0.
2. If `elements` is an empty list, the function will return 0.
3. If any element in `elements` is not present in `tup`, the count for that element will be 0, and it will not affect the final sum.

All the assertions provided in the problem description pass, and the code does not show any issues with the given examples or edge cases mentioned in the output hints.
