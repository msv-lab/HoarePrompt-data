Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the function described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list of elements `elements`, and returns the total count of occurrences of each element in `elements` within `tup`. The function iterates through each element in the `elements` list and counts its occurrences in the `tup` tuple using the `count` method, then sums these counts to produce the final result.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, counting the occurrences of each specified element in the tuple. There are no potential edge cases mentioned in the hints that the code fails to handle, and the provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for the given test cases. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
