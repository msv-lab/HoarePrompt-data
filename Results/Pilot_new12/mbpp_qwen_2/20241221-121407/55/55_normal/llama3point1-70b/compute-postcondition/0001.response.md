The code joins the capitalized versions of each word in the `words` list to form a new string `camel_case_str`. Each word in `words` is capitalized using the `capitalize()` method. The initial state is that `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores, and `words` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `snake_case_str` at each underscore.

After executing the code:

1. `snake_case_str` remains unchanged.
2. `words` remains unchanged.
3. `camel_case_str` is created by joining the capitalized versions of each word in `words`.

Since `snake_case_str` and `words` remain unchanged, we just need to describe the creation of `camel_case_str`.

Let's denote `snake_case_str` as "example_string". Splitting this string at each underscore results in `words` being `['example', 'string']`. Capitalizing each word and joining them results in `camel_case_str` being "ExampleString".

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores; `words` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `snake_case_str` at each underscore; `camel_case_str` is a string formed by capitalizing each word in `words` and joining them without spaces.**
