Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It splits the snake case string by underscores, capitalizes each word, and joins them together without any additional characters. This function works for all potential cases, including empty strings, strings with no underscores, and strings with multiple underscores. Since there is no edge case that the code is not handling correctly based on the problem description, the function is correct.
