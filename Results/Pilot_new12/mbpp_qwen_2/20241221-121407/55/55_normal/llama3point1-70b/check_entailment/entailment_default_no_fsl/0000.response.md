Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle cases where the input string contains characters other than lowercase letters and underscores. According to the output hints, this would result in unexpected behavior. For example, if the input string is "hello world", the function would capitalize both "hello" and "world" but would not remove the space between them, resulting in an incorrect camel case string "HelloWorld". Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
