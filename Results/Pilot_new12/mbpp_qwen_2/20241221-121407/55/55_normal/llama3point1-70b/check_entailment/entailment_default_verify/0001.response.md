Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string for all valid snake case inputs. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle the case where `snake_case_str` contains characters other than lowercase letters and underscores. This omission could lead to unexpected behavior or errors, which means the function does not fully meet the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment should be revised to reflect that the function is not entirely correct due to its lack of handling invalid input scenarios.
