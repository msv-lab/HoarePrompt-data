Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string by splitting the string at each underscore, capitalizing each word, and then joining them together without any spaces. The code handles the case where the input string is an empty string by returning an empty string. While the output hints mention that the function does not handle the case where the input string contains characters other than lowercase letters and underscores, the problem description does not specify this requirement. Therefore, the program meets the problem description for every potential case within the specified constraints.
