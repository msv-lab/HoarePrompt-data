You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_case_str is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores.
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)
    return camel_case_str
    #The program returns camel_case_str which is formed by capitalizing each word in words (obtained by splitting snake_case_str at each underscore) and joining them without spaces
#Overall this is what the function does:This function accepts a parameter `snake_case_str`, which is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores. It splits the string at each underscore to form a list of words, capitalizes each word in the list, and then joins them together without any spaces to form a new string `camel_case_str`. The function returns `camel_case_str`. The function handles the case where `snake_case_str` might be an empty string by returning an empty string. However, it does not handle the case where `snake_case_str` contains characters other than lowercase letters and underscores, which would result in unexpected behavior.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
