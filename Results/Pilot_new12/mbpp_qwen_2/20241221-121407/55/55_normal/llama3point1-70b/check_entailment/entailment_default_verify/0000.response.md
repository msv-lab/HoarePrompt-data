Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is correct, but the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where the input string contains characters other than lowercase letters and underscores. According to the problem description, the function should convert a snake case string to a camel case string, which implies that the function should only process valid snake case strings. Since the function does not validate the input format and can produce unexpected behavior or incorrect results when given invalid input, the original assessment of correctness is not accurate. Therefore, the final assessment is False.
