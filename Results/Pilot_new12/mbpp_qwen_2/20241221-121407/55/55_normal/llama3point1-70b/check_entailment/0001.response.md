Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string for all valid snake case inputs. The function splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each word (excluding the first one which is already in the correct position), and joins them together without any additional characters. This approach handles all potential cases where the input is a valid snake case string consisting of lowercase letters separated by underscores. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the given problem description.
