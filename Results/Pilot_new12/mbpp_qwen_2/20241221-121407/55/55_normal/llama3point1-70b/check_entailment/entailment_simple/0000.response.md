Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a single argument `snake_case_str`, which is expected to be a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores, as per the problem description.
2. The program splits the `snake_case_str` at each underscore using `split('_')`, resulting in a list of words.
3. Each word in this list is capitalized using a generator expression inside `capitalize()` and then joined back together without any spaces using `join`.
4. The final result, `camel_case_str`, is returned.

This process accurately converts the snake case format to camel case by ensuring the first letter of each word (after splitting by underscores) is capitalized and all other characters remain unchanged. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
