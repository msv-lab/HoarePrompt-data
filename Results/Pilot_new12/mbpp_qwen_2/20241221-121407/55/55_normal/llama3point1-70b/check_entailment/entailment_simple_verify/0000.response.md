Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string by splitting the string at underscores, capitalizing each word, and joining them together. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected for the given problem description. There are no edge cases or invalid inputs mentioned in the problem description that the function does not handle, and the annotations support the correctness of the function's behavior. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is justified.
