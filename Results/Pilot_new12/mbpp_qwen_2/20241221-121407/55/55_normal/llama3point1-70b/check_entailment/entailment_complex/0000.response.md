Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a snake case string (a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores) as input, splits it into words using the underscore as a delimiter, capitalizes the first letter of each word, and then joins these capitalized words together without any spaces to form a camel case string. The function also handles the special case where the input string might be an empty string by returning an empty string. This fully aligns with the problem description, which requires the function to convert a snake case string to a camel case string while handling the edge case of an empty input string. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
