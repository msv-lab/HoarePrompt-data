Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code supports the correctness of the function `func_1`. The function correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings as demonstrated by the provided test cases. The function splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together without any additional characters. Given the examples and the logic, the function works as expected for converting snake case to camel case. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as intended, handling the splitting, capitalization, and joining operations properly. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of correctness is appropriate.
