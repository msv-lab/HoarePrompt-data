Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It follows the problem description precisely:

1. The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `snake_str`, which is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores (`_`).
2. It splits the input string at each underscore, resulting in a list of substrings.
3. Each substring is capitalized using the `capitalize()` method.
4. The capitalized substrings are then joined together without any separators, forming the camel case string.

The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- `func_1('python_program') == 'PythonProgram'`
- `func_1('python_language') == 'PythonLanguage'`
- `func_1('programming_language') == 'ProgrammingLanguage'`

Since the function processes the input string exactly as described and the provided test cases validate its behavior, the program is correct according to the problem description.
