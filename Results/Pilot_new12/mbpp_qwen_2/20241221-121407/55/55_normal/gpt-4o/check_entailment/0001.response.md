Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings for all the test cases given and follows the problem description. It splits the snake case string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together without any additional characters. Given the examples and the logic, the function works as expected for converting snake case to camel case. There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues identified that would make the program incorrect.
