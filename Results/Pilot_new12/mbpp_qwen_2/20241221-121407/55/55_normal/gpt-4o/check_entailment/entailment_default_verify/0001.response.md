Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided problem description and the given code. The function `func_1` correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings as demonstrated by the assertions. The output hints confirm that the function processes the input string as expected, capitalizing each component and joining them together without any additional characters. Since the provided code adheres to the problem description and there are no edge cases or potential issues identified that would render the function incorrect under the given assumptions, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
