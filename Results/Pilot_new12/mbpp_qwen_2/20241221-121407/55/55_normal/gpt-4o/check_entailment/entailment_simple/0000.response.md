Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a snake case string (a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores) as input and converts it to a camel case string (where each word starts with a capital letter and there are no underscores).

- The function correctly splits the input string at each underscore using `snake_str.split('_')`.
- It then capitalizes the first letter of each component using a generator expression inside `join`, ensuring that each part of the string becomes a title-cased word.
- Finally, it joins these components back together without any separators, resulting in a valid camel case string.

The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected:
- `func_1('python_program') == 'PythonProgram'`
- `func_1('python_language') == 'PythonLanguage'`
- `func_1('programming_language') == 'ProgrammingLanguage'`

Since the function handles the transformation from snake case to camel case as required and the provided examples demonstrate this correctly, the program is considered correct according to the problem description.
