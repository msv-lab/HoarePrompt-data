The `split` method is called on `snake_str` using the underscore `_` as the delimiter. This splits the string into a list of substrings, each separated by an underscore. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `components`. Since the initial state specifies that `snake_str` contains only lowercase letters and underscores, the components will be substrings of these characters without any underscores.

Output State: **`snake_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores (_); `components` is a list of substrings from `snake_str` split by underscores.**
