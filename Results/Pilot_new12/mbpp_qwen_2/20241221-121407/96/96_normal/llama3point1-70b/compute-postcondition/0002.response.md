Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are of the same type. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This is achieved by converting the tuple into a set of types of its elements and checking if the length of this set is 1. The function handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, as there are no differing types present. It also correctly identifies tuples where all elements are of the same type, regardless of the type itself.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If the tuple `tup` is empty, the function returns `True` since there are no differing types.
- The function correctly identifies when all elements in the tuple are of the same type, such as `(1, 2, 3)` (all integers) or `('a', 'b', 'c')` (all strings).

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no missing functionality in the provided code. The code accurately implements the described behavior and handles all relevant cases.
