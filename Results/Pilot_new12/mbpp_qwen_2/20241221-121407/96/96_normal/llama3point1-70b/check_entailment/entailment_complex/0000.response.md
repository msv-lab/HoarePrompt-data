Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. Hereâ€™s why:

- The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as an argument.
- It uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to iterate over each element in the tuple and get its type.
- The `set()` function is used to create a set of these types. Since sets only store unique elements, if all elements in the tuple have the same type, the resulting set will contain only one type.
- The function then checks if the length of this set is 1 using `len(set(...)) == 1`.
- If the length is 1, it means all elements in the tuple have the same type, so the function returns `True`.
- If the length is greater than 1, it means at least two different types are present, so the function returns `False`.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies whether all elements in the tuple have the same type, meeting the problem description. The function also handles an empty tuple correctly by returning `True`, as there are no differing types to compare. Therefore, the program is correct.
