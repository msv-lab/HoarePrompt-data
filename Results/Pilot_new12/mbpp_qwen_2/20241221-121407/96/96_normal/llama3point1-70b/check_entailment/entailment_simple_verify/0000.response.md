Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type by converting each element to its type and storing these types in a set. Since a set only contains unique elements, if all elements in the tuple have the same data type, the set will contain only one type. Checking if the length of this set is 1 correctly determines whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The annotated version confirms that the function returns `True` if all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Thus, the program is correct based on the provided annotations and the original assessment.
