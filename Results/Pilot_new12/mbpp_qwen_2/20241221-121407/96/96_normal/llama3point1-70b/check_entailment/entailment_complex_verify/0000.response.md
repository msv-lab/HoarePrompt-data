Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type by using a set to store the types of elements in the tuple. Since a set only contains unique elements, if all elements in the tuple have the same data type, the set will contain only one type. Therefore, checking if the length of this set is 1 correctly determines whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, handling an empty tuple by returning `True` and correctly identifying tuples where all elements are of the same type, regardless of the type itself. Thus, the program meets the problem description.
