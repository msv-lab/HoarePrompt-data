Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to get the type of each element in the tuple, converts this to a set to remove duplicates, and then checks if the length of this set is 1. This approach ensures that if all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one type, and thus the function will return `True`. If there are different types, the set will contain more than one type, and the function will return `False`. The code handles an empty tuple correctly by returning `True`, as there are no differing types present. Therefore, the code follows the problem description for every potential case.
