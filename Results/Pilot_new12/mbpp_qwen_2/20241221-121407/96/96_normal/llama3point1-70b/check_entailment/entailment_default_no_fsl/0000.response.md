Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It uses a generator expression within the `set` to extract the types of the elements and then checks if the length of this set is 1. This approach works for all potential cases, including empty tuples, and correctly identifies tuples with elements of the same type. The code handles all mentioned scenarios accurately based on the problem description and output hints.
