Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type by converting the tuple into a set of types and verifying if the length of this set is 1. The function handles edge cases such as an empty tuple by returning `True`, as there are no differing types present. The output hints further confirm that the function works as intended, supporting the correctness of the program.
