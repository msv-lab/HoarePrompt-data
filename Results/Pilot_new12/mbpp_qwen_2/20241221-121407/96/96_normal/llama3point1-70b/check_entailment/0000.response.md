Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set to store the types of elements in the tuple. Since a set only contains unique elements, if all elements in the tuple have the same data type, the set will contain only one type. Therefore, checking if the length of this set is 1 correctly determines whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. This logic holds for all potential cases, so the program is correct.
