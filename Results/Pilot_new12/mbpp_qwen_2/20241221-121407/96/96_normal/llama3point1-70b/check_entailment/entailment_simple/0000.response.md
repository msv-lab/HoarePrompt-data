Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input and checks whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The problem description assumes that the input will be a valid tuple. The program does not need to validate this because the problem statement specifies valid input.

2. **Type Checking**: The program uses a set comprehension to collect the types of all elements in the tuple. Since a set can only contain unique elements, if all elements have the same type, the length of the resulting set will be 1. Conversely, if there are different types, the length will be greater than 1.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if the length of the set is 1 (indicating all elements are of the same type), and `False` otherwise.

This approach ensures that the function correctly identifies whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type, adhering to the problem description.
