Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type. It uses a generator expression `(type(x) for x in tup)` to get the type of each element in the tuple, converts it to a set to remove duplicates, and checks if the length of the set is 1. This approach is correct because:

- If all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one unique type.
- If elements have different types, the set will contain more than one type, and the condition `len(set((type(x) for x in tup))) == 1` will be false.

This logic handles all potential cases correctly, so the program is correct according to the problem description.
