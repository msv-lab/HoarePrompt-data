Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the state of the program and the expected behavior. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input and checks if all elements within the tuple have the same data type. This is done by converting the type of each element in the tuple into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. Since the annotation matches the functionality of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is correct. The function works as intended and meets the problem requirements.
