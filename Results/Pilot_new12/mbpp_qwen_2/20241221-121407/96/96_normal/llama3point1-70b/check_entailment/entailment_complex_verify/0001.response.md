Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type by using a set to collect unique types. The logic is sound: if all elements are of the same type, the set will contain only one unique type, and the condition `len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1` will return `True`. Conversely, if elements have different types, the set will contain more than one type, making the condition `False`. The function correctly handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, as there are no differing types present. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
