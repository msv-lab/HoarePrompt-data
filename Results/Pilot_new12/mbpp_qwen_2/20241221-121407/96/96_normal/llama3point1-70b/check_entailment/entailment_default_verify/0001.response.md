Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` have the same data type by using a set to eliminate duplicates and then checking the length of the set. The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` if all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise, including handling an empty tuple by returning `True`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to verify if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is maintained.
