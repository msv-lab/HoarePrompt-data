#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all elements in the tuple 'tup' are of the same type, otherwise False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are of the same type. Otherwise, it returns `False`. This is achieved by converting the tuple into a set of types of its elements and checking if the length of this set is 1. The function handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, as there are no differing types present. It also correctly identifies tuples where all elements are of the same type, regardless of the type itself.
