The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter. It checks whether all elements in the tuple are of the same type as the first element. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`. If any element in the tuple is of a different type than the first element, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function covers all edge cases including an empty tuple and tuples with elements of different types.
