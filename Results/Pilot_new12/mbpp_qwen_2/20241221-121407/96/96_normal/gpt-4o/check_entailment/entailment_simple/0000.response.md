Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly checks whether all elements in a given tuple have the same data type. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function handles the case where the tuple is empty by returning `True`. An empty tuple trivially has all elements of the same type because there are no elements to compare.

2. **Type Checking**: The function stores the type of the first element (`first_type`) and then iterates through each element in the tuple to check if its type matches `first_type`. If any element's type does not match, the function immediately returns `False`.

3. **Consistency Check**: After the loop, if no type mismatch was found, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements have the same type.

Given these points, the program meets the requirement specified in the problem description, which is to check if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. Therefore, the program is correct.
