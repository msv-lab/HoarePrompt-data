Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles empty tuples by returning `True`, which is correct since an empty tuple trivially has elements of the same (null) type. The function also iterates through the tuple and checks the type of each element against the type of the first element. If any element's type differs, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.
- `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns `False` because the elements are of different types (integers and a string).
- `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.

Since the function works correctly for these cases and there are no apparent edge cases that the function fails to handle, the program is correct.
