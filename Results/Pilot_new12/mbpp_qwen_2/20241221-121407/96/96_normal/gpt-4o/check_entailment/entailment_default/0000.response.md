Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles the case of an empty tuple by returning `True`, and it iterates through each element in the tuple, comparing its type to the type of the first element. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for both homogeneous and heterogeneous tuples. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case.
