Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It initializes the `first_type` with the type of the first element and then iterates through the tuple to ensure all elements match this type. The function handles empty tuples correctly by returning `True`. Given the provided test cases and the logic of the function, it appears to meet the problem description for the given examples and would work correctly for other similar cases as well.
