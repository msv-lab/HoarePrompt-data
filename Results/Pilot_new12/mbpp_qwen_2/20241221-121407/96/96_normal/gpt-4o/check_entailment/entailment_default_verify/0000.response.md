Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The function handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is the expected behavior. The logic of checking the type of the first element and then comparing the type of each subsequent element ensures that the function works as intended. The output hints also correctly describe the functionality of the function, confirming that the program meets the problem description and behaves as expected.
