Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the given tuple have the same data type. Here's why:

1. **Empty Tuple Handling**: The function correctly returns `True` for an empty tuple, as per the problem description.
2. **Type Checking**: The function assigns the type of the first element in the tuple to `first_type`. Then, it iterates through each element in the tuple, checking if the type of each element matches `first_type`. If any element does not match, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, if all elements match, it returns `True`.
3. **Edge Cases**: The program handles the edge case of an empty tuple and correctly identifies tuples with mixed types.

Given the problem description and the provided test cases, the function `func_1` behaves as expected and always meets the requirements specified. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
