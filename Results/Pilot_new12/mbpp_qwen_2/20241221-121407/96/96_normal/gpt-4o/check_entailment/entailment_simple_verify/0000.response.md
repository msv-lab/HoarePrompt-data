Final: **True**

Reasoning: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both indicate that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function works as intended: it initializes the `first_type` with the type of the first element and then iterates through the tuple to ensure all elements match this type. The function handles empty tuples correctly by returning `True`.

Given the provided test cases and the logic of the function, the program meets the problem description. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected under different conditions, including when the tuple is empty, contains mixed types, and contains elements of the same type. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and no changes are needed.
