Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`, which checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function correctly handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, as an empty tuple trivially satisfies the condition of having elements of the same type. The for loop iterates through the tuple, checking if each element's type matches the type of the first element. If any element's type differs, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`. The provided test cases also confirm the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is maintained as the program meets the problem description and the annotations support its correctness.
