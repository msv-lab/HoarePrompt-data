Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The provided output hints and the code itself confirm that the function handles both non-empty and empty tuples correctly. For non-empty tuples, it compares the type of each element with the type of the first element. For empty tuples, it returns `True`, which is the expected behavior as an empty tuple trivially has elements of the same type. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is appropriate.
