Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles the case of an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct because an empty tuple trivially has all elements of the same type (none). The code also correctly identifies when elements in the tuple are of different types by comparing each element's type to the type of the first element. All the provided test cases and the output hints align with this behavior, indicating that the function works as intended for the described problem.
