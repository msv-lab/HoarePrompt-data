Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected: it returns `True` for tuples where all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise. Additionally, it correctly handles an empty tuple by returning `True`. The provided test cases also validate this behavior. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is maintained.
