Output State: **`tup` is a tuple, and all elements in `tup` are of type `first_type`.** 

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `tup` is a tuple.
   - `first_type` is the type of the first element in `tup`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `tup`.
   - For each element, it checks if the type of the element is different from `first_type`.
   - If any element is found to be of a different type, the function immediately returns `False`.

3. **After the Loop Executes 1 Time**:
   - The loop checks the first element of `tup`.
   - If the first element is not of type `first_type`, the function returns `False`.
   - If the first element is of type `first_type`, the function continues to check the next element.

4. **After the Loop Executes 2 Times**:
   - The loop checks both the first and the second elements of `tup`.
   - If either of these elements is not of type `first_type`, the function returns `False`.
   - If both elements are of type `first_type`, the function continues to check the next element.

5. **General Case**:
   - The loop continues until all elements in `tup` have been checked.
   - If all elements are of type `first_type`, the function does not return `False` and completes without returning.

6. **Final State**:
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, all elements in `tup` must be of type `first_type`.
   - If the loop returns `False` at any point, `tup` contains at least one element that is not of type `first_type`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is that all elements in `tup` are of type `first_type`.
