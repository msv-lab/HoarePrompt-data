Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element.
  - The first element of `tup` is of type `first_type`.
  - The index is 0.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for element in tup:
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element.
   - The first element of `tup` is of type `first_type`.
   - The current index is 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `tup`.
   - In the previous iteration, the loop processed the first element (index 0).

3. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move to the next element in `tup`.
   - Since `tup` has at least 1 element, there must be another element following the first one.
   - The index will increment from 0 to 1.

4. **State Adjustment:**
   - The first element of `tup` has already been processed.
   - The next element (index 1) will be accessed in the next iteration.
   - Therefore, the new state should reflect the processing of the second element.

### Final State:
- `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element (still true).
- The next element in `tup` is of some type (not necessarily `first_type` as we don't know what the second element is).
- The index is now 1.

### Answer:
State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, the next element of `tup` is of some type, and the index is 1**
