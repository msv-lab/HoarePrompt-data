Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as a parameter. It checks whether all elements in the tuple are of the same type as the first element. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`. If any element in the tuple is of a different type than the first element, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`. The function covers all edge cases including an empty tuple and tuples with elements of different types.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
1. Checks if the tuple is empty and returns `True` if it is.
2. Determines the type of the first element in the tuple.
3. Iterates through each element in the tuple to verify that all elements are of the same type as the first element.
4. Returns `True` if all elements are of the same type, and `False` if any element is of a different type.

**The final state of the program after the function concludes will be:**
- The function returns `True` if the tuple is empty or if all elements in the tuple are of the same type as the first element.
- The function returns `False` if any element in the tuple is of a different type than the first element.
