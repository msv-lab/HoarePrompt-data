Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code uses the `count` method of strings to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. This approach is correct and works for all the test cases provided in the problem description. Since the `count` method handles all edge cases, such as empty strings and overlapping occurrences, the function `func_1` meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
