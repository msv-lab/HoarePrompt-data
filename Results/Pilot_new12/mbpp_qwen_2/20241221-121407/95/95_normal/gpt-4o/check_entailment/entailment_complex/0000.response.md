Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' within `s`. This is achieved using the built-in `count` method of strings, which counts how many times a specified value (in this case, 'std') appears in the string. The test cases provided in the assertions verify that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, including edge cases like an empty string, confirming that the function always meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
