Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of strings to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std'. This approach is correct and will work for all potential cases. The function is tested with various inputs including empty strings and strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', and it passes all the assertions. Since the function behaves as expected for the given test cases and the logic is sound, it is correct for every potential case described by the problem statement.
