Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string using the built-in `count` method. The function is tested with various inputs, including edge cases like an empty string and strings with multiple occurrences of 'std', and it passes all the assertions. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected and there are no edge cases mentioned that require special handling. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and the original assessment is correct.
