Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `count` method to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The provided output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected and handles the given test cases correctly. Since the function meets the problem description and the output hints support its correctness, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is valid.
