Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string `s` using the built-in `count` method of strings. The examples given in the problem description match the expected behavior of the function. The function handles all the provided test cases correctly, including edge cases like an empty string (`''`), where it returns 0, and cases where 'std' appears multiple times or only once. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
