Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It counts the number of occurrences of the substring `'std'` in the given string `s`. The program uses the built-in `count` method of strings in Python, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring in the string.

The test cases provided in the assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected:

- `func_1('letstdlenstdporstd') == 3`: The substring `'std'` appears 3 times.
- `func_1('truststdsolensporsd') == 1`: The substring `'std'` appears 1 time.
- `func_1('makestdsostdworthit') == 2`: The substring `'std'` appears 2 times.
- `func_1('stds') == 1`: The substring `'std'` appears 1 time.
- `func_1('') == 0`: The substring `'std'` does not appear in an empty string.

Since the program consistently returns the correct count of occurrences of the substring `'std'` in the given string for all the provided test cases, it is correct according to the problem description.
