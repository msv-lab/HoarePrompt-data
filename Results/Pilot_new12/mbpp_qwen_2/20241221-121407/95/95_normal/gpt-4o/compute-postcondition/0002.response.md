Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' within `s`. It performs this task by using the built-in `count` method of strings to count the number of times 'std' appears in `s`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations or code that need special handling. The function does not modify the input string `s` and simply returns an integer representing the count of 'std'.**
