Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. It handles all potential edge cases as described:
- For an empty string (`s = ""`), it returns 0.
- For strings where 'std' does not appear, it also returns 0.
- The function performs no additional operations beyond counting the occurrences of 'std', which aligns with the problem description.

Since the function behaves as expected for all described cases, the program is correct.
