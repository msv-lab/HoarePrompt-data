Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a single string `s` as input and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' within `s`. This exactly matches the problem description which states: "Write a function to count the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in a given string." Therefore, the program is correct.
