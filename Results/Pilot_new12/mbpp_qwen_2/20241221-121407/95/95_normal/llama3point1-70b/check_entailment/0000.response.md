Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. The method `str.count()` is used, which is designed to find the number of times a substring appears in a string. Since this method works as intended for all possible cases, the function meets the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
