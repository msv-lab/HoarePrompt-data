Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` using the built-in `count` method. This method will accurately handle all potential cases, including overlapping occurrences of 'std'. Since there is no potential case found where this function does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, the program is correct.
