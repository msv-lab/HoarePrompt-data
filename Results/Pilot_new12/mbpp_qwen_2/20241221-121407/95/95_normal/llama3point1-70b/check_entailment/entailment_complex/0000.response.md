Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by counting the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. The function uses the built-in `count` method of the string, which accurately counts how many times a specified substring appears in the string. The function handles all potential edge cases such as an empty string, where it would return 0, and strings where 'std' does not appear, also resulting in a return value of 0. The function does not perform any additional operations beyond counting the occurrences of 'std', which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
