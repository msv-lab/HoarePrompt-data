Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' within the input string `s`. The function uses the built-in `count` method of strings in Python, which is designed to count the occurrences of a specified substring. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for various cases, including empty strings and strings where 'std' does not appear. There are no additional operations or missing functionalities that would cause the program to fail for any potential case under the given assumptions. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
