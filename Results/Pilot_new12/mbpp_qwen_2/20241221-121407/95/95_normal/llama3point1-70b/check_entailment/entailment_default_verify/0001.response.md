Final: **True**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(s)` uses the built-in `count` method to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. The output hints further confirm that the function handles potential edge cases such as empty strings and strings without the substring 'std', returning 0 in these cases. Given that the problem description requires counting the occurrences of the string 'std' and the provided code accurately implements this functionality, the original assessment is accurate.
