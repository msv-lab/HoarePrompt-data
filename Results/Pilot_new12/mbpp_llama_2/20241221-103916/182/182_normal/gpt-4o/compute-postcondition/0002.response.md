Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters, where each character is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. The function handles tuples of any length and with any string values, including empty strings, and will return a list of the same length as the input tuple, with `None` or an empty string not being explicitly handled but implicitly returning an empty string or raising an exception if an empty string is encountered, which in Python would result in an empty string being returned for empty strings. The function does not modify the input tuple.**
