Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters, where each character is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. 

The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` is a concise and efficient way to achieve this. The `-1` index in `s[-1]` refers to the last character of each string `s` in the tuple `tup`. 

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for different input cases. Additionally, Python's behavior for empty strings, where `s[-1]` would raise an exception if `s` is an empty string, is not a concern here because the problem description assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., the input tuple will contain non-empty strings.

The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, indicating that the function handles tuples of any length and with any string values, and returns a list of the same length as the input tuple. 

Overall, the code is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
