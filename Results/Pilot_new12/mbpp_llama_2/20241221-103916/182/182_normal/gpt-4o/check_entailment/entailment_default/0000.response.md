Correctness: **True**

The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters, where each character is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string in the tuple and extracts the last character using `s[-1]`. This approach correctly handles tuples of any length and with any string values, including empty strings. 

The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function will return a list of the same length as the input tuple. The hints also mention that the function does not explicitly handle empty strings, but in Python, `s[-1]` will return an empty string when `s` is an empty string, which is the expected behavior.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers'))` returns `['s', 'r', 's']`, which are the last characters of each string in the input tuple. 

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the required functionality, and no potential cases were found where the code does not work as expected.
