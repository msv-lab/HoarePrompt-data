The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` is designed to extract the last character of each string in a tuple, and it achieves this functionality through a list comprehension that iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and returns a list of the last characters, accessed by `s[-1]`.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment. It explicitly states that the input to the function is a tuple containing strings and that the function returns a list of the last characters of all the strings in the tuple. This directly aligns with the problem description and the original assessment's justification.

Given the information available, including the problem description, the original code, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, there's no evidence to suggest that the program does not meet the specified requirements under the assumption of valid input. The program correctly extracts the last character of each string in the tuple, as demonstrated by the provided assertions.

The only case where the function might not behave as expected is when the tuple contains an empty string, which would raise an "indexError: string index out of range" error. However, based on the provided assertions and the problem description, the function is assumed to operate on non-empty strings. Therefore, under the specified conditions and examples provided, the original assessment remains accurate.

Final: **True**
