Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters, where each character is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and extracts the last character using `s[-1]`.

The function handles tuples of any length and with any string values, including empty strings. If an empty string is encountered, `s[-1]` will raise an `IndexError` in some languages, but in Python, it will return an empty string. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this edge case is not explicitly handled.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different inputs, returning the expected list of last characters. Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the program is correct and will always return the last character of each string in the input tuple.
