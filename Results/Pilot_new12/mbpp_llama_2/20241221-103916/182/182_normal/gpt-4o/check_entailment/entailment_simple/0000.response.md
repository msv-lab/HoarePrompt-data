Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description's requirement of extracting only the rear index element (i.e., the last character) of each string in the given tuple.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input.
2. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `tup`.
3. For each string `s`, `s[-1]` extracts the last character, which is then added to the list.
4. The resulting list of last characters is returned.

The provided assertions demonstrate the program's correctness:

* `func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers'))` returns `['s', 'r', 's']`, which are the last characters of each string in the tuple.
* `func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People'))` returns `['e', 'r', 'e']`, which are the last characters of each string in the tuple.
* `func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go'))` returns `['a', 't', 'o']`, which are the last characters of each string in the tuple.

The program accurately follows the problem description and extracts the last character of each string in the tuple, making it correct.
