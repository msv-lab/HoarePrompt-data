You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
assert func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People')) == ['e', 'r', 'e']
assert func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go')) == ['a', 't', 'o']

def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and returns the last character of each string using `s[-1]`.

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for tuples containing strings of varying lengths. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']` and `assert func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People')) == ['e', 'r', 'e']`, demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios.

Moreover, the function handles the case when the input tuple contains empty strings. For an empty string, `s[-1]` would raise an `IndexError`. However, since the problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle empty strings, and given that the unit tests do not include empty strings, it is reasonable to assume that the function is not required to handle this edge case.

Overall, based on the provided unit tests and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly extracts the rear index element of each string in the given tuple, and no cases have been identified where the function does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of characters, where each character is the last character of the corresponding string in the input tuple. The function handles tuples of any length and with any string values, including empty strings, and will return a list of the same length as the input tuple, with `None` or an empty string not being explicitly handled but implicitly returning an empty string or raising an exception if an empty string is encountered, which in Python would result in an empty string being returned for empty strings. The function does not modify the input tuple.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
