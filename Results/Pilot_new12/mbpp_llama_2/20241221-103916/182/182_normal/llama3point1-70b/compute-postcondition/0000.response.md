The given code snippet is a list comprehension that iterates over each string `s` in the tuple `strings` and returns a list of the last characters of each string. 

Since `strings` is a tuple of strings, we know that each element in `strings` is a string. The code `s[-1]` accesses the last character of each string `s`. 

Therefore, the program returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple `strings`.

Output State: **The program returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple `strings`**
