# Explanation of the program's correctness
The given Python function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. This is achieved through a list comprehension that iterates over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings` and extracts the last character using `s[-1]`.

# Correctness analysis
To determine if the program is correct, we need to check if it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description states that the function should extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.

The provided program does exactly this. For every string in the input tuple, it extracts the last character (which is the rear index element) and returns a list of these characters. The program does not modify the original tuple and only returns a new list with the extracted characters.

# Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly extracts the last character of each string in the input tuple and returns a list of these characters.

Correctness: **True**
