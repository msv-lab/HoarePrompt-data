Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully meet the problem description for every potential case because it does not handle the edge case where any string in the tuple is empty. In Python, attempting to access the last element of an empty string (`s[-1]`) results in an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception. This indicates that the function does not robustly handle all possible inputs as specified, particularly the case of empty strings within the tuple. To be considered correct, the function should either handle this case explicitly or it should be guaranteed by the problem description that no empty strings will be present in the tuple. Since the problem description does not explicitly exclude empty strings and the function does not handle this case, the function is not entirely correct for every potential case.
