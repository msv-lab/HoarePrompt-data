Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple, and the program does exactly that. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings` and extracts the last character `s[-1]` of each string.

The program correctly handles the case where the input tuple is not empty and contains non-empty strings. The assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty tuple of non-empty strings) is reasonable, as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the program does not need to handle edge cases such as empty tuples or strings, and it can focus on extracting the last characters of each string.

The use of `s[-1]` is a Pythonic way to access the last character of a string, and it is a common idiom in Python programming. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` is a concise and efficient way to create a new list containing the last characters of each string.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description, and it does so in a clear and efficient manner.
