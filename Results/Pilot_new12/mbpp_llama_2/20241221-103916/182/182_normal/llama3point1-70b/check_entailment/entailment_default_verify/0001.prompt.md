You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings`. For each string, it accesses the last character using the index `[-1]`, which is a common Python idiom for getting the last element of a sequence. 

The resulting list of last characters is then returned by the function. This approach works for tuples of any size, containing strings of any length, including empty strings. For empty strings, `s[-1]` would raise an IndexError, but this is a reasonable expectation since there is no last character in an empty string. 

However, it's worth noting that this function does not include any error handling for non-string elements in the tuple. If the tuple contains non-string elements, the function may raise an error or behave unexpectedly when trying to access the last character. But based strictly on the problem description, which does not mention error handling or non-string elements, the program is correct. 

Therefore, without considering edge cases like non-string elements or empty strings, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of strings and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. If the input tuple is empty, it will return an empty list. If any string in the tuple is empty, it will result in an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception, as the code does not handle this edge case. The function does not modify the original tuple of strings and only provides a derived output based on the last character of each string. It does not perform any validation or error handling on the input data type or content, assuming that the input will always be a tuple of strings.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
