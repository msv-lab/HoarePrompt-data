The original assessment states that the program is correct because it accurately extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. This assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment, as it clearly states that the program returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple `strings`. The annotation also mentions that the state of the program right before the function call is that `strings` is a tuple of strings, which aligns with the problem description.

Given the assumption that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the original assessment remains accurate. The program does indeed extract the last character of each string in the tuple, and the annotations confirm this behavior.

Therefore, based on the provided code, annotations, and problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
