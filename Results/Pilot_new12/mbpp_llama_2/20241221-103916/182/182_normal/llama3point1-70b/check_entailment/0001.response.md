Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it accurately extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the input tuple `strings`. For each string, it accesses the last character using the index `[-1]`, which is a common Python idiom for getting the last element of a sequence. 

The resulting list of last characters is then returned by the function. This approach works for tuples of any size, containing strings of any length, including empty strings. For empty strings, `s[-1]` would raise an IndexError, but this is a reasonable expectation since there is no last character in an empty string. 

However, it's worth noting that this function does not include any error handling for non-string elements in the tuple. If the tuple contains non-string elements, the function may raise an error or behave unexpectedly when trying to access the last character. But based strictly on the problem description, which does not mention error handling or non-string elements, the program is correct. 

Therefore, without considering edge cases like non-string elements or empty strings, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
