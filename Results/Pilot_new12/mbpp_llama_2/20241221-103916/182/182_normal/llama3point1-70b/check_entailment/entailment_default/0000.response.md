Correctness: **False**.

The code does not handle the edge case where a string in the tuple is empty. According to the output hints, if any string in the tuple is empty, it will result in an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception. This indicates that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, as it should extract the rear index element of each string, but instead fails when a string is empty. 

The program description asks to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple, implying that it should be able to handle all cases, including empty strings. However, the code does not account for this scenario, leading to an error. Therefore, the code is considered incorrect. 

To fix this issue, the code could add a condition to check if a string is empty before trying to access its last character, for example:

```python
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] if s else '' for s in strings]
```

This modified code checks if a string `s` is empty, and if so, returns an empty string instead of trying to access its last character.
