#State of the program right berfore the function call: strings is a tuple of strings.
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
    #The program returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple `strings`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of strings and returns a list of the last characters of each string in the tuple. If the input tuple is empty, it will return an empty list. If any string in the tuple is empty, it will result in an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception, as the code does not handle this edge case. The function does not modify the original tuple of strings and only provides a derived output based on the last character of each string. It does not perform any validation or error handling on the input data type or content, assuming that the input will always be a tuple of strings.
