The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common size (`size`), and returns the median of the combined sorted list. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers if the total count of numbers is even, or the single middle number if the total count is odd. This functionality assumes that the input lists are indeed sorted in ascending order and that their lengths match the provided `size` parameter. The function does not modify the input lists (`list1` and `list2`) and only returns a numerical value representing the median of the combined list. It handles both even and odd total counts of numbers correctly, ensuring the median is accurately calculated in all cases. The function does not include error checking for scenarios where the input lists are not sorted, or where their lengths do not match the `size` parameter, so it relies on the caller to ensure these preconditions are met.
