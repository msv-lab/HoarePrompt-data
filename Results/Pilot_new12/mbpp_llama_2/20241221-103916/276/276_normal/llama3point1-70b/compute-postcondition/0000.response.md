The code merges `list1` and `list2` into a new list, and then sorts it in ascending order. The values of `list1`, `list2`, and `size` are not affected. 

`merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted merged list of `list1` and `list2`. Since both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order, the merged list will contain all the elements from `list1` and `list2`, also in ascending order.

The size of `merged_list` will be twice the size of `list1` or `list2` because `len(list1) == size` and `len(list2) == size`. So, the size of `merged_list` is `2 * size`.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers, `size` is a positive integer, `len(list1)` equals `size`, `len(list2)` equals `size`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`, and the size of `merged_list` is `2 * size`.**
