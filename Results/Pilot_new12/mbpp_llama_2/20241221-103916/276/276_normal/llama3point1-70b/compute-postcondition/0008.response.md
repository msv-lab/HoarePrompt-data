The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers, and `size` is a positive integer. The function has the constraint that the lengths of `list1` and `list2` must be equal to `size`, and both `list1` and `list2` must be sorted in ascending order. After executing the function body, the function returns the median of the sorted combined list of `list1` and `list2`, which can be either the average of the two middle numbers if the total count of numbers is even, or the single middle number if the total count is odd. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists of numbers and their size, and return the median of the combined sorted list.

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers and their size, and returns the median of the combined sorted list.**
