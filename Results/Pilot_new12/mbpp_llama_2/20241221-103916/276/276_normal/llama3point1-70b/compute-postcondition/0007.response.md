To find the output state, let's analyze the given information and the return statement.

Given:
- `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of numbers.
- `size` is a positive integer.
- `len(list1) = size` and `len(list2) = size`.
- `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`.
- The size of `merged_list` is `2 * size`.
- `middle_index` equals `size - 1`.
- If `size` is even, `median` equals `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`.
- If `size` is odd, `median` equals `merged_list[size]`.

The return statement is `return median`. 

Considering the conditions for `median`:
- If `size` is even, the `median` will be the average of the two middle numbers in `merged_list`, which are `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`.
- If `size` is odd, the `median` will be the middle number in `merged_list`, which is `merged_list[size]`.

Given that `merged_list` is a sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, both of which are sorted, and that its size is `2 * size`, the `median` calculation effectively finds the middle value(s) of the combined and sorted list.

Output State: **The program returns the median of the sorted combined list of `list1` and `list2`, which is either the average of the two middle numbers if the total count of numbers is even, or the single middle number if the total count is odd.**
