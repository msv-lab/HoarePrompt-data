Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

The issue lies in the calculation of the `middle_index`. The `middle_index` is currently calculated as `size - 1`, which is incorrect because the merged list has a length of `2 * size`, not `size`. 

When `size` is even, the median should be the average of the two middle numbers in the merged list, which are at indices `size - 1` and `size` (0-based indexing). However, when `size` is odd, the median should be the middle number in the merged list, which is at index `size`.

To correctly calculate the median, the `middle_index` should be calculated as `size - 1` for both even and odd `size` cases, and then the median should be calculated based on whether `2 * size` is even or odd.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if ((2 * size) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```

But even this will still be incorrect as the indexing will be off. The middle_index should be `size` when `2 * size` is odd and `size - 1` when `2 * size` is even.

Here is the fully corrected code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    if ((2 * size) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[size]
    return median
```

Or more simply:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median
```
