Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code appears to be correct. The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists `list1` and `list2`, and their common size `size` as input. It first merges the two lists and sorts the resulting list. Then, it calculates the median based on whether the total count of numbers is even or odd. The output hints agree with the code and provide a good explanation of its functionality. 

The function correctly handles both even and odd total counts of numbers, ensuring the median is accurately calculated in all cases. Since we assume that the input will be valid, the function's lack of error checking for scenarios where the input lists are not sorted, or where their lengths do not match the `size` parameter, does not affect its correctness. 

For example, if we have two sorted lists `list1 = [1, 3, 5]` and `list2 = [2, 4, 6]` with a common size of 3, the function will return the median of the combined sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is `(3 + 4) / 2 = 3.5`. Similarly, if we have two sorted lists `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]` with a common size of 2, the function will return the median of the combined sorted list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. 

In both cases, the function correctly calculates the median of the combined sorted list. Therefore, the code seems to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
