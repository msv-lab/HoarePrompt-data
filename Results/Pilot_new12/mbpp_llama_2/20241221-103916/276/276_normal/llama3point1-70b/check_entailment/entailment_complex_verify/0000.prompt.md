You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` has a logical error. The problem description asks for finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, the given code does not validate whether the input lists are sorted or of the same size. Additionally, the calculation of the middle index is incorrect. It should be calculated based on the total size of the merged list, not just the size of one list.

A case where this program does not work correctly is when the input lists are not sorted. For instance, if `list1 = [5, 1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4, 6]`, the function will still return the median of the merged and sorted list, but it does not check if the input lists are sorted as the problem description implicitly requires.

Another issue is with the calculation of the `middle_index`. The correct `middle_index` should be `size * 2 // 2` or simply `size`, because the merged list will have a size of `2 * size`. This will cause the function to return incorrect results when the total size is even, as it currently only checks the element at `size - 1` and the next one.

Furthermore, when calculating the median for an even-sized merged list, the function should take the average of the two middle elements. However, due to the incorrect calculation of the `middle_index`, this will also result in incorrect medians. 

To fix these issues, the function should be modified to validate the input lists' properties and correctly calculate the median based on the merged list's size. Here is an example of a corrected version:

```python
def find_median(list1, list2, size):
    # Check if lists are of the same size and sorted
    if len(list1)!= size or len(list2)!= size:
        raise ValueError("Lists are not of the same size")
    if list1!= sorted(list1) or list2!= sorted(list2):
        raise ValueError("Lists are not sorted")
    
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    total_size = len(merged_list)
    middle_index = total_size // 2
    
    if total_size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    
    return median
```

This corrected version first checks if the input lists are of the same size and sorted, then calculates the median based on the total size of the merged list.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers, size is a positive integer such that len(list1) == size and len(list2) == size, and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` is a sorted list of numbers, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers, `size` is a positive integer, `len(list1)` equals `size`, `len(list2)` equals `size`, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers equal to `sorted(list1 + list2)`, the size of `merged_list` is `2 * size`, and `middle_index` equals `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` equals `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`. If `size` is odd, `median` equals `merged_list[size]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the sorted combined list of `list1` and `list2`, which is either the average of the two middle numbers if the total count of numbers is even, or the single middle number if the total count is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common size (`size`), and returns the median of the combined sorted list. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers if the total count of numbers is even, or the single middle number if the total count is odd. This functionality assumes that the input lists are indeed sorted in ascending order and that their lengths match the provided `size` parameter. The function does not modify the input lists (`list1` and `list2`) and only returns a numerical value representing the median of the combined list. It handles both even and odd total counts of numbers correctly, ensuring the median is accurately calculated in all cases. The function does not include error checking for scenarios where the input lists are not sorted, or where their lengths do not match the `size` parameter, so it relies on the caller to ensure these preconditions are met.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
