You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, the provided program assumes that the size parameter passed to the function is the size of each list, and it uses this size to calculate the median. This assumption is not always true.

A counterexample can be found when the size of the lists is not equal to the size parameter passed to the function. For instance, if we have two lists `list1 = [1, 3, 5]` and `list2 = [2, 4, 6]`, and we call `func_1(list1, list2, 3)`, the program will work correctly and return the median of the merged list. However, if we call `func_1(list1, list2, 4)`, the program will still return a value, but it will not be the correct median of the two lists because the size parameter does not match the actual size of the lists.

Moreover, the code does not validate if the input lists are sorted, which is a requirement according to the problem description. If the input lists are not sorted, the function will not return the correct median.

To fix these issues, the function should be modified to handle cases where the size parameter does not match the actual size of the lists, and it should also validate if the input lists are sorted. The correct function should be:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if len(list1)!= len(list2):
        raise ValueError("Lists must be of the same size")
    if list1!= sorted(list1) or list2!= sorted(list2):
        raise ValueError("Lists must be sorted")
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    size = len(merged_list)
    middle_index = size // 2
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
This revised function first checks if the input lists are of the same size and if they are sorted. It then merges the lists, sorts the merged list, and calculates the median.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two sorted lists of numbers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common size (`size`), and returns the median of the combined sorted list. The median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers if the total count of numbers is even, or the single middle number if the total count is odd. This functionality assumes that the input lists are indeed sorted in ascending order and that their lengths match the provided `size` parameter. The function does not modify the input lists (`list1` and `list2`) and only returns a numerical value representing the median of the combined list. It handles both even and odd total counts of numbers correctly, ensuring the median is accurately calculated in all cases. The function does not include error checking for scenarios where the input lists are not sorted, or where their lengths do not match the `size` parameter, so it relies on the caller to ensure these preconditions are met.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
