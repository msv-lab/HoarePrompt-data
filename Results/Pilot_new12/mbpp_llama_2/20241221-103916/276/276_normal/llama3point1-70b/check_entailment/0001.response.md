Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, the provided program assumes that the size parameter passed to the function is the size of each list, and it uses this size to calculate the median. This assumption is not always true.

A counterexample can be found when the size of the lists is not equal to the size parameter passed to the function. For instance, if we have two lists `list1 = [1, 3, 5]` and `list2 = [2, 4, 6]`, and we call `func_1(list1, list2, 3)`, the program will work correctly and return the median of the merged list. However, if we call `func_1(list1, list2, 4)`, the program will still return a value, but it will not be the correct median of the two lists because the size parameter does not match the actual size of the lists.

Moreover, the code does not validate if the input lists are sorted, which is a requirement according to the problem description. If the input lists are not sorted, the function will not return the correct median.

To fix these issues, the function should be modified to handle cases where the size parameter does not match the actual size of the lists, and it should also validate if the input lists are sorted. The correct function should be:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if len(list1)!= len(list2):
        raise ValueError("Lists must be of the same size")
    if list1!= sorted(list1) or list2!= sorted(list2):
        raise ValueError("Lists must be sorted")
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    size = len(merged_list)
    middle_index = size // 2
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median
```
This revised function first checks if the input lists are of the same size and if they are sorted. It then merges the lists, sorts the merged list, and calculates the median.
