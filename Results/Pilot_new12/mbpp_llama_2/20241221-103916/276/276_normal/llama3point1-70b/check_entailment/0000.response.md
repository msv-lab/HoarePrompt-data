Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` has a logical error. The problem description asks for finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, the given code does not validate whether the input lists are sorted or of the same size. Additionally, the calculation of the middle index is incorrect. It should be calculated based on the total size of the merged list, not just the size of one list.

A case where this program does not work correctly is when the input lists are not sorted. For instance, if `list1 = [5, 1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4, 6]`, the function will still return the median of the merged and sorted list, but it does not check if the input lists are sorted as the problem description implicitly requires.

Another issue is with the calculation of the `middle_index`. The correct `middle_index` should be `size * 2 // 2` or simply `size`, because the merged list will have a size of `2 * size`. This will cause the function to return incorrect results when the total size is even, as it currently only checks the element at `size - 1` and the next one.

Furthermore, when calculating the median for an even-sized merged list, the function should take the average of the two middle elements. However, due to the incorrect calculation of the `middle_index`, this will also result in incorrect medians. 

To fix these issues, the function should be modified to validate the input lists' properties and correctly calculate the median based on the merged list's size. Here is an example of a corrected version:

```python
def find_median(list1, list2, size):
    # Check if lists are of the same size and sorted
    if len(list1)!= size or len(list2)!= size:
        raise ValueError("Lists are not of the same size")
    if list1!= sorted(list1) or list2!= sorted(list2):
        raise ValueError("Lists are not sorted")
    
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    total_size = len(merged_list)
    middle_index = total_size // 2
    
    if total_size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index - 1] + merged_list[middle_index]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    
    return median
```

This corrected version first checks if the input lists are of the same size and sorted, then calculates the median based on the total size of the merged list.
