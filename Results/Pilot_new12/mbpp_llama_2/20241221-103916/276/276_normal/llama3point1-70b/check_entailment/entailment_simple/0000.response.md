Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the median of the combined list of `list1` and `list2`. 

The issue is with the calculation of the `middle_index`. The `middle_index` should be the index of the middle element in the combined list, which has a length of `2 * size`. If `size` is even, the middle index should be `size - 1` and `size`. If `size` is odd, the middle index should be `size`.

However, in the given program, the `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which is incorrect. 

The correct calculation of the `middle_index` should be:

- If the total count of numbers is even, the middle indices are `size` and `size - 1`, and the median is the average of the numbers at these indices.
- If the total count of numbers is odd, the middle index is `size`, and the median is the number at this index.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    if (2 * size) % 2 == 0 :
        median = (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[size]
    return median
```

In this corrected code, the `middle_index` is correctly calculated as `size` for odd-sized lists, and the median is correctly calculated as the average of the two middle numbers for even-sized lists.
