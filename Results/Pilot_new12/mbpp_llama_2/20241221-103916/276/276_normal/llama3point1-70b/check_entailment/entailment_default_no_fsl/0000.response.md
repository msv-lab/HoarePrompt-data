Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case because it assumes the input lists are sorted and their lengths match the provided `size` parameter, but it does not include any error checking to ensure these preconditions are met. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not the main issue. 

The main issue here is that the problem description states that the two input lists are of the same size, but the function calculates the median of the combined list, which has twice the size of the input lists. This means that the `size` parameter passed to the function should be half the length of the merged list, not the length of one of the input lists.

For example, if we have two lists `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]`, both of the same size 2, the merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The function should calculate the median of this merged list, which would be the average of the two middle numbers, i.e., `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, if we pass the size of one of the input lists, i.e., `2`, to the function, it will calculate the median incorrectly.

Therefore, the function does not work correctly for every potential case, and the Correctness is **False**.
