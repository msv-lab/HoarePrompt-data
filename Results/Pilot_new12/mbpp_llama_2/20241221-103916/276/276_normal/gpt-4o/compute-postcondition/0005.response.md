Given the initial state and the code `median = merged_list[mid]`, we need to determine the output state.

The initial state is: `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`, and `mid` is equal to `n`. Additionally, the system enters the else block, which under normal circumstances would imply that the length of `merged_list` is not even, but given that `2n` is always even for any positive integer `n`, this specific condition is always met, making the premise of entering the else block due to an odd length of `merged_list` inconsistent with the given initial conditions.

However, to adhere to the task format and analyze the given code's effect without considering the logical inconsistency of the else block condition:

- `median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[mid]`.
- Given `mid` equals `n`, `median` will be the value at index `n` in `merged_list`.
- Since `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with a length of `2n`, and `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list[mid]` (or `merged_list[n]`) will be the `(n+1)`th element in the sorted combined list of `list1` and `list2`, because list indices start at 0.

The states of `list1`, `list2`, `n`, `merged_list`, and `mid` are not changed by this operation. Thus, the output state reflects the assignment of `median` and the unchanged conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`, `mid` is equal to `n`, and `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`.**
