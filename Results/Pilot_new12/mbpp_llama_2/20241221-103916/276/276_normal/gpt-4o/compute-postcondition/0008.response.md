The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, and `n` is a positive integer. The constraints are such that `len(list1) == n` and `len(list2) == n`, and both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order. After executing the function body, the function returns the median of the sorted merged list, which is the average of the nth and (n+1)th elements in the sorted merged list of integers from `list1` and `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of integers and their length, returns the median of the merged sorted list.**
