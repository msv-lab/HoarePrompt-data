To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and initial state. 

- `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- The length of `list1` and `list2` is `n`.
- Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted in ascending order.
- The code `merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)` merges `list1` and `list2` into a single list and sorts it in ascending order.

Given that `list1` and `list2` are already sorted, the merged list will contain all elements from both lists, also sorted in ascending order. The length of `merged_list` will be `2n`, since it contains all elements from `list1` and `list2`.

The states of `list1`, `list2`, and `n` are not affected by the code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`.**
