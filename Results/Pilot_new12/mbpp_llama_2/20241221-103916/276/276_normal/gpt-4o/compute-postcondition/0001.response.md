The value of `mid` is assigned the integer division of `len(merged_list)` by 2. The length of `merged_list` is `2n` because it contains all elements from `list1` and `list2`, both of length `n`. Thus, `mid` is equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`, and `mid` is equal to `n`.**
