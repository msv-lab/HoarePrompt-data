Given that `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`, `mid` is equal to `n`. Since the length of `merged_list` is `2n` and `n` is a positive integer, the length of `merged_list` is even. 

When the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is equal to `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. 

`merged_list[n - 1]` is the nth element from the start in the sorted merged list (since indexing starts at 0), and `merged_list[n]` is the (n+1)th element from the start.

Output State: **The program returns the median of the sorted merged list, which is the average of the nth and (n+1)th elements in the sorted merged list of integers from list1 and list2.**
