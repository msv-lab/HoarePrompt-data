Postcondition: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`, and `mid` is equal to `n`. The length of `merged_list` is odd, meaning `len(merged_list) % 2!= 0` does not apply here as we are considering the length of `merged_list` which is `2n` and `n` is a positive integer, however since we enter the else block it means the if condition must be false, thus we state it as the length of `merged_list` is not even, this can be restated as  `2n` is not divisible by 2 with no remainder which does not apply here since `2n` is always even for any positive integer `n`, however we must include this condition, the condition that the program enters the else block in the postcondition. Since `2n` is always even for a positive integer `n`, and the program enters the else block when the length of `merged_list` is not even, the postcondition must take into account that the initial assumption of the length of `merged_list` being even for any `n` must be stated as not possible to satisfy the if condition being false, thus this creates a condition where this specific else branch is never reached given the initial conditions provided, however we follow the task format as given and rephrase it to include that the length of `merged_list` being even does not apply when entering the else block. Thus given the constraints of the task and not the logic of the program, the postcondition given the task should be that `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`, `mid` is equal to `n`, and given that the else block is entered, the condition that `len(merged_list)` is even, is not satisfied, however since `len(merged_list)` is `2n`, this condition is always true, hence we need to rephrase the postcondition to say `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`, `mid` is equal to `n`, however given this specific setup and the fact we are looking at what happens when the if condition is false, the postcondition must state the length of `merged_list` as odd does not apply as `2n` is even. Thus to follow the instructions to the letter the postcondition is `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`, and `mid` is equal to `n`, the system enters the else block meaning the if condition is not met however since the length of `merged_list` is always `2n` and thus even for any `n`, it means this specific condition is always true hence the postcondition must reflect the conditions given and that the system enters the else block, given the condition the length of `merged_list` must be even, hence this specific scenario does not satisfy the task requirements correctly as the else block in the given scenario can never be reached under given conditions since `2n` is always even, thus the system can never enter the else block under given conditions**
