Postcondition: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`, and `mid` is equal to `n`. The current length of `merged_list` is even, as the length of `merged_list` is divisible by 2 with no remainder.**
