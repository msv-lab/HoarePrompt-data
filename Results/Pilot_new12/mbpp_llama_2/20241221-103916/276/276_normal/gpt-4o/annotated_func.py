#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, n is a positive integer such that len(list1) == n and len(list2) == n, and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`, `mid` is equal to `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is equal to `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. Otherwise, `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the sorted merged list, which is the average of the nth and (n+1)th elements in the sorted merged list of integers from list1 and list2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common length (`n`), merges these lists, sorts the merged list, and returns the median of this sorted merged list. The median calculation depends on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. If the length is odd, the median is the middle element. The function assumes that `list1` and `list2` are of equal length (`n`) and are sorted in ascending order, but it does not validate these assumptions. It also does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or where `list1` and `list2` are not lists of integers. The function's primary action is to compute and return the median of the combined and sorted input lists, providing a single value that represents the middle point of the dataset when it is ordered.
