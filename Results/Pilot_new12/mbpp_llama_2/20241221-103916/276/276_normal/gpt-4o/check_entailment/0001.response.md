Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct according to the problem description. It merges two sorted lists into one, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median. 

Here's why the program is correct:
- The function `func_1` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` and their length `n` as input.
- It merges the two lists into one and sorts the merged list.
- If the length of the merged list is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the length is odd, the median is the middle number.
- The program correctly handles both even and odd length cases.

All the provided assertions pass, and there are no obvious edge cases that the program does not handle. The program works as expected for the given problem description. 

For example, when the input is `func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5)`, the merged list is `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`. The length of the merged list is 10, which is even. The median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is `(15 + 17) / 2 = 16.0`. This matches the expected output.

However, the function does not check if the input lists are sorted. If the input lists are not sorted, the function will still return a result, but it may not be the correct median. But according to the problem description, it is assumed that the input lists are already sorted. 

Also, the function takes the length `n` as an input, but it does not use it to check if the input lists have the same length. If the input lists do not have the same length, the function will still return a result, but it may not be the correct median according to the problem description. 

But in the context of this specific problem, where the lists are of the same size and are sorted, the program works correctly.
