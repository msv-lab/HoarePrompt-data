Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The problem description asks for a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

Here's why the program does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size `n` as input.
2. It merges these lists into a single list `merged_list` using the `+` operator.
3. It sorts the `merged_list` in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It calculates the median of the `merged_list` depending on whether the length of the `merged_list` is even or odd.
5. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
6. If the length is odd, the median is the middle element.
7. The function returns the calculated median.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function works correctly for different inputs.

The program does not need to handle invalid inputs (e.g., lists of different lengths, unsorted lists, non-integer values, etc.) because the problem description assumes that the input will be valid.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and its correctness is **True**.
