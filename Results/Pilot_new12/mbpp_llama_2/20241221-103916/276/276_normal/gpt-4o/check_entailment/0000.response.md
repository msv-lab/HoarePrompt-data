Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` merges two sorted lists, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median. The function works correctly for both even and odd length lists.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The function takes two lists `list1` and `list2` and their length `n` as input.
2. It merges the two lists using the `+` operator and sorts the merged list using the `sorted()` function.
3. The function calculates the middle index `mid` of the merged list using integer division `//`.
4. If the length of the merged list is even, the function calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements.
5. If the length of the merged list is odd, the function calculates the median as the middle element.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for different input scenarios. The function handles both even and odd length lists correctly, and it calculates the median as expected.

Since the function works correctly for all the provided test cases and follows the problem description, it is considered correct. The code does not have any obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail, and it correctly handles the calculation of the median for two sorted lists of the same size.
