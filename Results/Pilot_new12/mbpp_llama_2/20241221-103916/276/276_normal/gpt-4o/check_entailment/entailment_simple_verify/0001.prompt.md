You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct according to the problem description. It merges two sorted lists into one, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median. 

Here's why the program is correct:
- The function `func_1` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` and their length `n` as input.
- It merges the two lists into one and sorts the merged list.
- If the length of the merged list is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the length is odd, the median is the middle number.
- The program correctly handles both even and odd length cases.

All the provided assertions pass, and there are no obvious edge cases that the program does not handle. The program works as expected for the given problem description. 

For example, when the input is `func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5)`, the merged list is `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`. The length of the merged list is 10, which is even. The median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is `(15 + 17) / 2 = 16.0`. This matches the expected output.

However, the function does not check if the input lists are sorted. If the input lists are not sorted, the function will still return a result, but it may not be the correct median. But according to the problem description, it is assumed that the input lists are already sorted. 

Also, the function takes the length `n` as an input, but it does not use it to check if the input lists have the same length. If the input lists do not have the same length, the function will still return a result, but it may not be the correct median according to the problem description. 

But in the context of this specific problem, where the lists are of the same size and are sorted, the program works correctly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, n is a positive integer such that len(list1) == n and len(list2) == n, and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2n`, `mid` is equal to `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` is equal to `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. Otherwise, `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the sorted merged list, which is the average of the nth and (n+1)th elements in the sorted merged list of integers from list1 and list2.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
