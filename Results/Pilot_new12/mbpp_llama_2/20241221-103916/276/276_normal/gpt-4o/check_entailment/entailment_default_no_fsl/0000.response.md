Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The code merges the two lists, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. The function handles both cases as specified in the problem description and output hints.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correct functionality of the program for both even and odd lengths of the merged list. The code correctly calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements when the length is even and as the middle element when the length is odd.

Since we assume that the input will be valid, the program does not need to handle cases where the input lists are not sorted, not of equal length, or contain non-integer values. The program correctly implements the required functionality based on the provided problem description and output hints, and the unit tests validate its correctness.
