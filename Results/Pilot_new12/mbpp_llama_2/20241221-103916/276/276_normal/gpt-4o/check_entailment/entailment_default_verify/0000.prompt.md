You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` merges two sorted lists, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median. The function works correctly for both even and odd length lists.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The function takes two lists `list1` and `list2` and their length `n` as input.
2. It merges the two lists using the `+` operator and sorts the merged list using the `sorted()` function.
3. The function calculates the middle index `mid` of the merged list using integer division `//`.
4. If the length of the merged list is even, the function calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements.
5. If the length of the merged list is odd, the function calculates the median as the middle element.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for different input scenarios. The function handles both even and odd length lists correctly, and it calculates the median as expected.

Since the function works correctly for all the provided test cases and follows the problem description, it is considered correct. The code does not have any obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail, and it correctly handles the calculation of the median for two sorted lists of the same size.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common length (`n`), merges these lists, sorts the merged list, and returns the median of this sorted merged list. The median calculation depends on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. If the length is odd, the median is the middle element. The function assumes that `list1` and `list2` are of equal length (`n`) and are sorted in ascending order, but it does not validate these assumptions. It also does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or where `list1` and `list2` are not lists of integers. The function's primary action is to compute and return the median of the combined and sorted input lists, providing a single value that represents the middle point of the dataset when it is ordered.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
