You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct according to the problem description. It merges two sorted lists into one, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median. 

Here's why the program is correct:
- The function `func_1` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` and their length `n` as input.
- It merges the two lists into one and sorts the merged list.
- If the length of the merged list is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the length is odd, the median is the middle number.
- The program correctly handles both even and odd length cases.

All the provided assertions pass, and there are no obvious edge cases that the program does not handle. The program works as expected for the given problem description. 

For example, when the input is `func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5)`, the merged list is `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`. The length of the merged list is 10, which is even. The median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is `(15 + 17) / 2 = 16.0`. This matches the expected output.

However, the function does not check if the input lists are sorted. If the input lists are not sorted, the function will still return a result, but it may not be the correct median. But according to the problem description, it is assumed that the input lists are already sorted. 

Also, the function takes the length `n` as an input, but it does not use it to check if the input lists have the same length. If the input lists do not have the same length, the function will still return a result, but it may not be the correct median according to the problem description. 

But in the context of this specific problem, where the lists are of the same size and are sorted, the program works correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) and their common length (`n`), merges these lists, sorts the merged list, and returns the median of this sorted merged list. The median calculation depends on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. If the length is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements. If the length is odd, the median is the middle element. The function assumes that `list1` and `list2` are of equal length (`n`) and are sorted in ascending order, but it does not validate these assumptions. It also does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer or where `list1` and `list2` are not lists of integers. The function's primary action is to compute and return the median of the combined and sorted input lists, providing a single value that represents the middle point of the dataset when it is ordered.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
