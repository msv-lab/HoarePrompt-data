Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` and their common length `n` as input.
2. It merges the two lists into a single list `merged_list` and sorts it in ascending order.
3. It calculates the middle index `mid` of the merged list.
4. If the length of the merged list is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle elements (`merged_list[mid - 1]` and `merged_list[mid]`). If the length is odd, it returns the middle element (`merged_list[mid]`) as the median.
5. The function returns the calculated median.

The program meets the problem description for the following reasons:

* It correctly merges the two sorted lists into a single sorted list.
* It correctly calculates the median of the merged list, considering both even and odd lengths.
* The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for different input cases.

The program assumes that the input lists are sorted and have the same length, as specified in the problem description. Since we assume that the input will be valid, the program does not need to handle cases where the input lists are not sorted or have different lengths. Therefore, the program is correct in the context of the problem description.
