#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all characters in string `s` are the same, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns `True` if all characters in `s` are the same, `False` otherwise. It handles strings of any length, including empty strings, and considers all characters, including spaces and special characters, when determining uniqueness. The function does not modify the input string `s` and does not perform any error checking on the input type, implying it assumes `s` will always be a string. If `s` is an empty string, the function will return `True` because there are no characters to compare, thus all characters (none) are the same.
