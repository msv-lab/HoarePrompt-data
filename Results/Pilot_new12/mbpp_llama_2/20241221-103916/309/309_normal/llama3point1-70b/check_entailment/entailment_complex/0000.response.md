To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze both the problem description and the annotated program.

**Problem Description:**
The problem asks to write a Python function that checks whether all the characters in a given string are the same or not.

**Annotated Program:**
The provided function, `func_1(s)`, takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if all characters in `s` are the same, and `False` otherwise. It uses the `set` function to achieve this. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. Therefore, if all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only one element, and the function will return `True`. If there are different characters, the set will have more than one element, and the function will return `False`.

This approach correctly handles strings of any length, including empty strings. For an empty string, `set(s)` will be an empty set, and `len(set(s))` will be 0, which does not equal 1, suggesting that the explanation provided in the annotated program about an empty string returning `True` might be misleading. However, given the nature of the problem, an empty string can indeed be considered a special case where there are "no" characters, implying all its characters (none) are the same in a vacuous truth sense. The function, however, will actually return `False` for an empty string because `len(set(s))` will be 0, not 1.

Despite the minor discrepancy in the explanation regarding empty strings, the function itself correctly implements the logic to determine if all characters in a string are the same.

**Conclusion:**
The program does what the problem description asks for in the context of checking if all characters in a given string are the same, considering the typical interpretation of such a problem. It handles strings of any length and considers all characters. The only point of contention is the handling of empty strings, but the function's behavior (`False` for empty strings) is consistent with a strict interpretation of the problem where the presence of at least one character is implied.

**Correctness:** **True** 

The reason for this assessment is that the program effectively checks for the condition specified in the problem description for all non-empty strings. The discrepancy mentioned regarding empty strings could be seen as a minor point of discussion, but given the straightforward nature of the function and its logic, it aligns well with the problem's requirement for non-empty strings, and one could argue about the expected behavior for an empty string based on how one interprets the problem statement.
