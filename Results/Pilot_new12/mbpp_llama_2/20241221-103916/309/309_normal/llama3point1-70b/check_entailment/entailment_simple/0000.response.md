Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to check whether all characters in a given string are the same. The provided function, `func_1`, achieves this by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is equal to 1.

Here's why it works:

- A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements. When a string is converted into a set, all duplicate characters are removed, and only unique characters remain.
- If all characters in the string are the same, the set will contain only one unique character, hence the length of the set will be 1.
- If there are multiple unique characters in the string, the length of the set will be greater than 1.

Given that we assume the input to the function will always be a non-empty string (as stated in the problem description and the assumptions about valid inputs), the function `func_1` correctly returns `True` when all characters are the same and `False` otherwise. Therefore, it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
