#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings that are sorted in a case-insensitive manner, meaning the sorting is based on the lowercase version of each string, and these sublists are derived from the original list_of_lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input, where each sublist may contain zero or more strings, and returns a new list of lists with the same structure. Each sublist in the returned list contains the same strings as the corresponding original sublist, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner based on the lowercase version of each string. This means that strings are ordered alphabetically without regard to their original case, and the original list remains unchanged. The function handles sublists of any length, including empty sublists, and preserves the overall list structure. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. If any sublist contains non-string elements, the function will throw an error when trying to sort the sublist in a case-insensitive manner, because the key function expects a string to call the lower() method on.
