The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input, where each sublist may contain zero or more strings, and returns a new list of lists with the same structure. Each sublist in the returned list contains the same strings as the corresponding original sublist, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner based on the lowercase version of each string. This means that strings are ordered alphabetically without regard to their original case, and the original list remains unchanged. The function handles sublists of any length, including empty sublists, and preserves the overall list structure. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. If any sublist contains non-string elements, the function will throw an error when trying to sort the sublist in a case-insensitive manner, because the key function expects a string to call the lower() method on.
