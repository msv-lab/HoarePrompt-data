Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I will evaluate the program's correctness.

The problem description requires writing a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist contains strings, and uses a list comprehension to sort each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner.

The original assessment claims that the program is correct, and the reasoning provided seems sound:

* The function iterates over each sublist in the input list of lists.
* For each sublist, it applies the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower`, which sorts the strings in a case-insensitive manner.
* The results of sorting each sublist are collected into a new list of lists, which is then returned.

The annotated version of the code describes the state of the program before and after the function call, which matches the expected behavior.

Given this information, I believe the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the required functionality, and the annotated version does not provide any evidence to contradict the original assessment.

The key points that support the correctness of the program are:

* The use of `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` ensures case-insensitive sorting of strings.
* The list comprehension correctly iterates over each sublist and applies the sorting function.
* The program returns a new list of lists, which is derived from the original input, with each sublist containing sorted strings.

Since the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
