To verify the correctness of the given Python function, we need to understand the problem description and the implementation of the function. 

The problem description asks to write a function that sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function should return a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings that are sorted.

The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list. For each sublist, it uses the built-in `sorted` function with the `key` argument set to `str.lower` to sort the strings in a case-insensitive manner.

Here's why the program is correct:

- The function iterates over each sublist in the input list, ensuring that all sublists are processed.
- The `sorted` function is used with the `key` argument set to `str.lower`, which means that the sorting is based on the lowercase version of each string. This ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, meaning that "Apple" and "apple" would be considered equal for sorting purposes.
- The function returns a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the sorted strings. This output matches the problem description.

Therefore, the function always does what the problem description says. It correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the input list in a case-insensitive manner and returns the sorted list of lists.

Correctness: **True**
