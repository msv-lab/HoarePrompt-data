Correctness: **True**.

The provided program uses a list comprehension to sort each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The `sorted` function is used with the `key=str.lower` argument to ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive.

This approach handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty sublists: The `sorted` function returns an empty list for an empty input, which is the expected result.
* Sublists with a single element: The `sorted` function returns a list containing the single element, which is the expected result.
* Sublists with multiple elements: The `sorted` function returns a sorted list, which is the expected result.
* Sublists containing both uppercase and lowercase strings: The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, which means that "a" and "A" will be considered equal.
* Sublists containing strings with non-ASCII characters: The `str.lower` method handles non-ASCII characters correctly, which means that the sorting will work as expected.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It handles all potential cases and edge cases correctly, and it uses a concise and efficient approach to achieve the desired result.
