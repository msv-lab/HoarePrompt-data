Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Sorting Sublists of Strings**: The function `func_1` sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The problem description requires this exact behavior, and the function achieves it by using a list comprehension to apply the `sorted` function to each sublist.

2. **Case-Insensitive Sorting**: The sorting within each sublist is done in a case-insensitive manner. This is implemented by passing `key=str.lower` to the `sorted` function, which ensures that strings are compared based on their lowercase equivalent, thereby ignoring the original case of the strings.

3. **Preserving List Structure**: The function preserves the original structure of the list of lists. It returns a new list where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding original sublist but sorted. This behavior matches the problem description.

4. **Handling Empty Sublists and Input List**: Although the problem description does not explicitly mention error handling for empty lists or sublists, the function inherently handles these cases correctly because the `sorted` function can handle empty lists and will simply return an empty list. Similarly, if the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list, as expected.

5. **Assumption of Valid Input**: As per the instructions, we assume that the input will always be valid. Therefore, we do not need to consider cases where the input might not be a list of lists of strings, or where sublists might contain non-string elements, which could cause an error when trying to sort in a case-insensitive manner.

In summary, given the problem description and the assumption of valid input, the program is correct because it sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner, preserves the original list structure, and correctly handles the sorting of sublists regardless of their length, including empty sublists.
