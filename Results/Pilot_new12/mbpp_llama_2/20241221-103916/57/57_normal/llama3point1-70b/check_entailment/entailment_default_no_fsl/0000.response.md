Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists of strings as input, sorts each sublist in a case-insensitive manner using the `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument, and returns a new list of lists with the same structure as the input. The code handles sublists of any length, including empty sublists, and preserves the overall list structure.

The code also correctly handles the case where the input list is empty, returning an empty list. The use of a list comprehension ensures that the original list remains unchanged. The `sorted` function with the `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the strings are ordered alphabetically without regard to their original case.

The only potential issue mentioned in the output hints is that if any sublist contains non-string elements, the function will throw an error when trying to sort the sublist in a case-insensitive manner. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not considered a correctness issue. Therefore, the code is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
