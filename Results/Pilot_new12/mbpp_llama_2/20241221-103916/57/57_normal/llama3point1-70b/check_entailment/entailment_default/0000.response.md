Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` seems to correctly implement the described behavior. It takes a list of lists of strings, sorts each sublist in a case-insensitive manner, and returns a new list of lists with the sorted sublists. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list of lists, avoiding modifications to the original list. The `sorted` function is used with the `key=str.lower` argument to achieve case-insensitive sorting.

The output hints agree with the code and provide additional insight into its behavior. The function indeed handles sublists of any length, including empty sublists, and preserves the overall list structure. If the input list is empty, the function correctly returns an empty list.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input list contains non-string elements or is not a list. Under these assumptions, the code seems to be correct for every potential case, and it works as expected according to the problem description.
