You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings that are sorted in a case-insensitive manner, meaning the sorting is based on the lowercase version of each string, and these sublists are derived from the original list_of_lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input, where each sublist may contain zero or more strings, and returns a new list of lists with the same structure. Each sublist in the returned list contains the same strings as the corresponding original sublist, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner based on the lowercase version of each string. This means that strings are ordered alphabetically without regard to their original case, and the original list remains unchanged. The function handles sublists of any length, including empty sublists, and preserves the overall list structure. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. If any sublist contains non-string elements, the function will throw an error when trying to sort the sublist in a case-insensitive manner, because the key function expects a string to call the lower() method on.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
