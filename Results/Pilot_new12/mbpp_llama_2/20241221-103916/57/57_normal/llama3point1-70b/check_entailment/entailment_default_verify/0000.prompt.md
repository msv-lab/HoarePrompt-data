You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program uses a list comprehension to sort each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The `sorted` function is used with the `key=str.lower` argument to ensure that the sorting is case-insensitive.

This approach handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty sublists: The `sorted` function returns an empty list for an empty input, which is the expected result.
* Sublists with a single element: The `sorted` function returns a list containing the single element, which is the expected result.
* Sublists with multiple elements: The `sorted` function returns a sorted list, which is the expected result.
* Sublists containing both uppercase and lowercase strings: The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, which means that "a" and "A" will be considered equal.
* Sublists containing strings with non-ASCII characters: The `str.lower` method handles non-ASCII characters correctly, which means that the sorting will work as expected.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It handles all potential cases and edge cases correctly, and it uses a concise and efficient approach to achieve the desired result.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists of strings as input, where each sublist may contain zero or more strings, and returns a new list of lists with the same structure. Each sublist in the returned list contains the same strings as the corresponding original sublist, but sorted in a case-insensitive manner based on the lowercase version of each string. This means that strings are ordered alphabetically without regard to their original case, and the original list remains unchanged. The function handles sublists of any length, including empty sublists, and preserves the overall list structure. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list. If any sublist contains non-string elements, the function will throw an error when trying to sort the sublist in a case-insensitive manner, because the key function expects a string to call the lower() method on.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
