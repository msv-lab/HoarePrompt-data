Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist contains strings. The function uses a list comprehension to sort each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

- The function iterates over each sublist in the input list of lists.
- For each sublist, it applies the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower`, which sorts the strings in a case-insensitive manner.
- The results of sorting each sublist are collected into a new list of lists, which is then returned.

This program correctly handles the following cases:

- Empty sublists: The `sorted` function can handle empty lists without any issues.
- Sublists with a single element: The `sorted` function will return the sublist as is, since it's already sorted.
- Sublists with multiple elements: The `sorted` function will correctly sort the elements in a case-insensitive manner.
- List of lists with multiple sublists: The program will correctly sort each sublist independently.

Since the program correctly handles all these cases, and the problem description does not specify any additional requirements or constraints, the program can be considered correct. 

Example usage:

```python
list_of_lists = [["Hello", "world"], ["Zebra", "apple"], ["Cat", "Dog"]]
print(func_1(list_of_lists))
# Output: [["Hello", "world"], ["apple", "Zebra"], ["Cat", "Dog"]]
```
