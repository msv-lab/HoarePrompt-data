The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings that are sorted in a case-insensitive manner. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists of strings and return a new list of lists where each sublist has its strings sorted in a case-insensitive manner.
