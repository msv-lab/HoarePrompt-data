The function accepts a list of lists of strings and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in ascending order. The function handles empty sublists and empty input lists correctly, returning an empty list or a list of empty lists respectively. It does not perform any error checking or handling for non-string or non-list inputs, so the function may throw an exception if the input contains non-string or non-list elements. The function preserves the original input list and its sublists, returning a new sorted list of lists without modifying the original.
