Correctness: **True**

The provided code sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists as required by the problem description. It uses a list comprehension with the built-in `sorted` function to achieve this. The code also handles edge cases like empty sublists and empty input lists correctly, returning an empty list or a list of empty lists respectively.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality and do not indicate any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. The hints also mention that the function preserves the original input list and its sublists, which is true since the code returns a new sorted list of lists without modifying the original.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list of lists of strings. The code's simplicity and adherence to the problem description make it correct for all potential valid inputs. 

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the code's correctness, as they cover various cases, including lists with different lengths and strings in different orders. 

Overall, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, making it correct.
