Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that accepts a list of lists of strings and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in ascending order.

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list and sorts the strings in each sublist using the built-in `sorted` function. The sorted sublists are then returned as a new list of lists.

The program correctly handles empty sublists and empty input lists, returning an empty list or a list of empty lists respectively, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests.

As we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the lack of error checking or handling for non-string or non-list inputs does not affect the correctness of the program.

The program preserves the original input list and its sublists, returning a new sorted list of lists without modifying the original, which meets the problem description.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and its correctness can be verified as **True**.
