You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is designed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to apply the built-in `sorted` function to each sublist. This approach ensures that all sublists are sorted in ascending order.

The provided unit tests show that the function handles various cases correctly:

* Sorting distinct strings
* Handling strings with leading or trailing whitespace
* Sorting strings in different cases (e.g., 'zilver' and 'gold')

Since the `sorted` function is a stable sort and is case-sensitive, it will sort strings with different cases correctly. The program does not attempt to strip whitespace or convert all strings to the same case, which might be desired in certain scenarios but is not specified in the problem description.

In all the provided test cases and potential edge cases, the function appears to work as expected. Without any additional information about potential edge cases the program does not handle, it can be concluded that the program is correct according to the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists of strings and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in ascending order. The function handles empty sublists and empty input lists correctly, returning an empty list or a list of empty lists respectively. It does not perform any error checking or handling for non-string or non-list inputs, so the function may throw an exception if the input contains non-string or non-list elements. The function preserves the original input list and its sublists, returning a new sorted list of lists without modifying the original.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
