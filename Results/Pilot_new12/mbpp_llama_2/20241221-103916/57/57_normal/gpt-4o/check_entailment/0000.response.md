Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is designed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to apply the built-in `sorted` function to each sublist. This approach ensures that all sublists are sorted in ascending order.

The provided unit tests show that the function handles various cases correctly:

* Sorting distinct strings
* Handling strings with leading or trailing whitespace
* Sorting strings in different cases (e.g., 'zilver' and 'gold')

Since the `sorted` function is a stable sort and is case-sensitive, it will sort strings with different cases correctly. The program does not attempt to strip whitespace or convert all strings to the same case, which might be desired in certain scenarios but is not specified in the problem description.

In all the provided test cases and potential edge cases, the function appears to work as expected. Without any additional information about potential edge cases the program does not handle, it can be concluded that the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
