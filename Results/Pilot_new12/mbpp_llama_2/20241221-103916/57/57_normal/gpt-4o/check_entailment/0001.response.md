Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses list comprehension to sort each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The `sorted()` function is used to sort each sublist in ascending order. The code correctly handles the task as described in the problem statement.

The program works as expected for the provided test cases, and it does not appear to have any missing logic or edge cases that are not handled. It correctly sorts the sublists in a case-sensitive manner, which means that it treats uppercase letters as coming before lowercase letters. 

For example, if the input is `[['Z', 'a'], ['b', 'A']]`, the output will be `[['Z', 'a'], ['A', 'b']]`. This is the expected behavior for a case-sensitive sort.

Overall, the program appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
