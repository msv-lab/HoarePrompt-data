The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The code defines a function `func_1` that sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to apply the built-in `sorted` function to each sublist, which ensures that all sublists are sorted in ascending order.

The output hints provide additional information about the code's functionality, stating that it handles empty sublists and empty input lists correctly, preserves the original input list and its sublists, and returns a new sorted list of lists without modifying the original. This information aligns with the original assessment and the code's behavior.

One potential issue mentioned in the output hints is that the function may throw an exception if the input contains non-string or non-list elements. However, this is not a correctness issue, as the problem description assumes that the input will be a list of lists of strings.

Based on the provided information, there is no evidence to suggest that the program does not meet the problem description. The code is well-structured, and the output hints confirm its expected behavior.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, as there is no compelling reason to change it.

The reason I believe the original assessment is accurate is that the code correctly implements the desired functionality, and the output hints provide additional confirmation of its behavior.

Final: **True**
