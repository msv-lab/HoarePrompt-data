Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The provided function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input `list_of_lists` and sorts the strings in each sublist using the built-in `sorted` function.

The `sorted` function in Python returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence, and by default, it sorts the elements in ascending order. Since the sublists contain strings, the `sorted` function will sort them lexicographically, which is the expected behavior.

The function returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in `list_of_lists`, but the strings are sorted in ascending order, which meets the problem description.

The unit tests provided also validate the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios with varying input data and verify that the function returns the expected sorted lists.

Overall, the function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the input list of lists, as required by the problem description, and therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
