Correctness: **True**

The given code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in ascending order. 

The code uses a list comprehension to create a new sorted list of lists, which ensures that the original input list and its sublists are not modified. The `sorted` function is used to sort each sublist, which correctly handles empty sublists and empty input lists.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different input cases, including lists with varying lengths and string values. The output hints agree with the code and confirm that the function handles empty sublists and empty input lists correctly, and that it does not modify the original input list.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's lack of error checking for non-string or non-list inputs does not affect its correctness.

Overall, the code correctly implements the required functionality and works as expected for all potential cases, given the problem description and assumptions about valid input.
