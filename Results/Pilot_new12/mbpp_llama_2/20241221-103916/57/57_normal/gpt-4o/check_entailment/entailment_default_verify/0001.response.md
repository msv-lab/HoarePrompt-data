Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The code correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists using list comprehension and the `sorted()` function. The output hints confirm that the function handles empty sublists and empty input lists correctly, returns a new sorted list of lists without modifying the original, and preserves the original input list and its sublists.

The output hints also mention that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-string or non-list inputs, which could potentially throw an exception if the input contains non-string or non-list elements. However, this does not affect the correctness of the program with respect to the problem description, as we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The provided test cases demonstrate the correct behavior of the function, and the code is concise and readable. The original assessment correctly notes that the program treats uppercase letters as coming before lowercase letters, which is the expected behavior for a case-sensitive sort.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
