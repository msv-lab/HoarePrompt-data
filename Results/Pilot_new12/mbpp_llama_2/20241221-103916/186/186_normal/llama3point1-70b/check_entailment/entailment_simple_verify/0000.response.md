The original assessment states that the provided function is incorrect because it uses the bitwise AND operator (&) instead of the logical AND operator (and) for performing an element-wise "and" operation on tuples of boolean values. This assessment is accurate based on the problem description, which asks to extract the element-wise "and" of two tuples.

The annotated code supports this assessment by indicating that the function returns a tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. However, as noted in the original assessment, the bitwise AND operation may not be the intended "and" operation, especially if the tuples contain boolean values.

For example, the bitwise AND operation will produce incorrect results when applied to tuples of boolean values, as demonstrated by the example provided in the original assessment:

```python
tup1 = (True, False, True)
tup2 = (False, True, True)
print(func_1(tup1, tup2))  # This will print (0, 0, 1) which is the result of the bitwise AND operation, not the logical AND operation.
```

In this case, the expected result of the element-wise "and" operation would be `(False, False, True)`, which is not the same as the result produced by the bitwise AND operation.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the final assessment of the program's correctness remains the same as the original assessment.

Final: **False**
