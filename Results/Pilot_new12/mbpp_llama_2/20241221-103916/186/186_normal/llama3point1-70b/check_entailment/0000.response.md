Correctness: **False**.

The problem statement asks to extract the element-wise "and" of two tuples, but it also mentions "and tuples" which can be interpreted as performing the "and" operation on corresponding elements of the two tuples. However, the provided function uses the bitwise AND operator (&) which is not the correct way to perform an element-wise "and" operation on tuples of non-integer or non-boolean values.

For example, if the input tuples contain strings or other non-integer/non-boolean values, the function will raise a TypeError because the bitwise AND operator is not defined for these types. Even if the tuples contain integer values, the bitwise AND operation may not be the intended "and" operation.

A correct implementation would depend on the exact definition of "and" operation for the elements of the tuples. If the tuples contain boolean values, the function should use the logical AND operator (and). If the tuples contain other types of values, the function should use a different definition of "and" that is applicable to those types.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

```python
tup1 = (True, False, True)
tup2 = (False, True, True)
print(func_1(tup1, tup2))  # This will print (0, 0, 1) which is the result of the bitwise AND operation, not the logical AND operation.
```
