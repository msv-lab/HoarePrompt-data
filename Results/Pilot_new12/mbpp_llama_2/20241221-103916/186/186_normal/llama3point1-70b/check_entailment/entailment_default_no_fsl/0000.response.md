Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The problem asks for a function to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples, but the provided code performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements in the two tuples. 

The problem description does not explicitly state what operation should be performed on the tuples, but based on the phrase "extract the elementwise and tuples", it seems that the intention is to create a new tuple where each element is a tuple containing the corresponding elements from the input tuples. 

However, the provided code performs a bitwise AND operation, which is not equivalent to extracting the element-wise tuples. 

For example, if we have two tuples `(1, 2, 3)` and `(4, 5, 6)`, the correct output should be `((1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6))`, but the provided code will return `(0, 0, 0)` because the bitwise AND of `1` and `4` is `0`, the bitwise AND of `2` and `5` is `0`, and the bitwise AND of `3` and `6` is `0`. 

Therefore, the provided code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
