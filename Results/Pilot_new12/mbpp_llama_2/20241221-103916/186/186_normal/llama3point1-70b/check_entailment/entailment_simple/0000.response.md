Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples, but the provided program performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements in the two tuples.

In the context of the problem description, "elementwise and tuples" would typically imply that the function should return a tuple containing the elements from both input tuples, possibly in a combined or paired manner, not the result of a bitwise operation. 

The current implementation of the function uses the `&` operator, which performs a bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements of the two tuples. This operation is typically used for binary numbers, not for combining or extracting elements from tuples.

To meet the requirements of the problem description, the function should be designed to return a tuple where each element is a pair (or some form of combination) of the corresponding elements from the input tuples `tup1` and `tup2`. For example, it could return a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains one element from `tup1` and one element from `tup2`, achieved using `zip(tup1, tup2)`. 

Here's an example of how it could be correctly implemented:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This version of the function returns a tuple where each element is a tuple containing the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. However, without a clear definition of what "elementwise and tuples" means in the context of the problem, it's difficult to provide a definitive solution. The provided program clearly does not meet this vague requirement as it performs a bitwise AND operation instead.
