Correctness: **False**

The given program is attempting to extract elementwise tuples from two input tuples. However, the problem description does not specify what "elementwise and tuples" means. Based on the provided code, it seems like the intention is to perform a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements in the two input tuples.

The issue with this program is that it does not handle cases where the input tuples are of different lengths. If `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths, the `zip` function will stop once the shortest tuple is exhausted, effectively ignoring the extra elements in the longer tuple. This may not be the desired behavior.

For example, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the function will return `(4,)` because `zip` will only iterate over the first two elements of `tup1`. However, it would be more reasonable to raise an error or return a specific value to indicate that the input tuples have different lengths.

Additionally, the function assumes that all elements in the input tuples are integers or other types that support the bitwise AND operation. If the tuples contain other types of elements, such as strings or lists, the function will raise a `TypeError`.

A correct implementation would need to handle these edge cases explicitly. For instance, it could raise a `ValueError` if the input tuples have different lengths, or it could check the types of the elements before attempting to perform the bitwise AND operation. 

Here's an example of how you could modify the function to handle tuples of different lengths and non-integer elements:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    if len(tup1)!= len(tup2):
        raise ValueError("Input tuples must have the same length")
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2) if isinstance(x, int) and isinstance(y, int)))
```
