Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements in the problem description for several reasons:

1. The problem description asks for a function to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided program performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements in the input tuples, which does not match the problem description.
2. There is a misunderstanding in the interpretation of "elementwise and tuples". The program performs a bitwise AND operation, which implies that it's working with numerical types and performing a logical AND operation at the bit level. If the intention was to perform an element-wise logical AND operation between tuples, the task would be more aligned with the description. However, even in this case, the description lacks clarity on what "elementwise and tuples" precisely means, especially considering the context provided by the code, which assumes numerical operations.
3. The program assumes that both input tuples contain elements that can be subjected to a bitwise AND operation, which means they must be numerical. If the tuples contain non-numerical data, the operation would fail. However, this issue is more related to the assumption of valid input rather than a direct mismatch with the problem description.

To fulfill the original problem description accurately, more clarification on what "extract the elementwise and tuples" means in the context of tuple operations would be necessary. If the intention was to perform a logical AND between corresponding elements in two tuples (where elements are boolean), a different operation would be required. For example:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x and y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
```

This revised function would perform an element-wise logical AND operation between two tuples, assuming both tuples contain boolean values. However, without clear clarification on what "elementwise and tuples" operation is intended in the problem description, determining the correctness of the original program remains speculative.
