Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. The function assumes that both input tuples have the same length, as it uses the `zip` function to iterate over the elements in parallel. If the tuples have different lengths, the function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring any remaining elements in the longer tuple. The function does not modify the original input tuples and does not perform any error checking to ensure that the input values are valid for bitwise operations. The returned tuple will have the same length as the shorter of the two input tuples, with each element being the result of the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements in the input tuples.**
