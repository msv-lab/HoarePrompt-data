Correctness: **False**.

The problem description asks for a function to extract the element-wise minimum and tuples from two given tuples. However, the provided code does not meet this description. The code uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to calculate the result for each pair of corresponding elements from the input tuples, which does not calculate the minimum. 

For example, if we call `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`, the code will calculate the bitwise AND of corresponding elements, resulting in `(10 & 5, 4 & 2, 6 & 3, 9 & 3)`, which equals `(0, 0, 2, 1)`. However, the expected result for the element-wise minimum would be `(5, 2, 3, 3)`. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description correctly for all potential cases.
