Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it successfully extracts the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. The function `func_1` takes two tuples as input, performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements, and returns a tuple with the results. 

The function handles all potential cases as described in the problem, including cases where the input tuples are of different lengths. The `zip` function automatically stops at the end of the shorter tuple, effectively ignoring any extra elements from the longer tuple. 

Additionally, the function performs the expected bitwise AND operation, which is consistent with the problem description. The function also does not modify the input tuples, which is consistent with the fact that tuples are immutable in Python.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correct functionality of the function. For example, the test `assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)` shows that the function correctly performs the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements.

Overall, the program correctly implements the described functionality and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
