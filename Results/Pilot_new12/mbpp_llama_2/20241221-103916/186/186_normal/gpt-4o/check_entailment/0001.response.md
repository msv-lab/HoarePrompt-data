Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not meet the problem description of extracting the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. The code uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to compare elements from the two tuples, which is not the expected behavior. The problem description is unclear about what it means by "extract the element-wise and tuples", but based on the unit tests provided, it seems that the function should compare corresponding elements from the two tuples and return a tuple where each element is the result of comparing the corresponding elements from the input tuples.

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input tuples contain negative numbers. The bitwise AND operator (&) will produce unexpected results for negative numbers.

For example, if we call the function with the following input:
```python
func_1((-1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))
```
The function will return `(-1, 2, 3, 0)`, which is not the expected result.

To fix this issue, the function should be modified to compare the elements from the two tuples correctly. However, without a clear understanding of what the problem description means by "extract the element-wise and tuples", it's difficult to provide a correct implementation.

Here is a possible implementation that compares the corresponding elements from the two tuples and returns a tuple where each element is 1 if the corresponding elements are in the correct order (i.e., the element from the first tuple is less than the element from the second tuple) and 0 otherwise:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(int(a < b) for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
This implementation assumes that the problem description means to compare the corresponding elements from the two tuples and return a tuple where each element indicates whether the corresponding elements are in the correct order.
