Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it only performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from the two input tuples, but it does not extract the elementwise and tuples as required by the problem description. 

The problem description is unclear about what "extract the elementwise and tuples" means, but based on the typical meaning of "elementwise" operations, it seems that the problem is asking for a tuple where each element is a comparison or combination of the corresponding elements from the two input tuples. 

The provided program only performs a bitwise AND operation, which may not be the desired operation. If the problem description means to perform a comparison between corresponding elements, the program should return a tuple of boolean values indicating whether each element in the first tuple is less than, equal to, or greater than the corresponding element in the second tuple. 

For example, given the input tuples (10, 4, 6, 9) and (5, 2, 3, 3), the program should return a tuple indicating the comparison results, such as (1, 1, 1, 1) if the comparison is greater than, or (0, 0, 2, 1) if the comparison is based on the sign of the difference between the elements.

However, without a clear definition of "extract the elementwise and tuples", it's impossible to determine the exact required behavior. But it's clear that the provided program does not meet the problem description as it only performs a bitwise AND operation. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
