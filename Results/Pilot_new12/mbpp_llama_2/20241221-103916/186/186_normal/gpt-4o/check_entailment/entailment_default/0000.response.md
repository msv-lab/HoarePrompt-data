Correctness: **False**.

The provided code performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of two tuples, whereas the problem description requires the function to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples. The problem description does not clearly specify what "extract the element-wise and tuples" means, but based on the provided code, it seems that the code is performing a bitwise AND operation, not extracting tuples.

However, assuming that the problem description means to perform a bitwise AND operation (based on the provided code and output hints), the code seems to be correct in this case. It correctly performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples.

But if we consider the function name `func_1` and the unit tests provided, they suggest that the function should return a tuple of comparisons between the corresponding elements of the two input tuples, not their bitwise AND. The function name and unit tests do not match the operation performed by the function, which is a bitwise AND operation. 

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and hence the Correctness is **False**. 

One potential case where the program does not work as expected is when the user expects the function to return a tuple of comparisons between the corresponding elements of the two input tuples, but the function returns a tuple of bitwise AND operations instead. For example, if the user calls `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`, they might expect the function to return a tuple indicating whether each element in the first tuple is less than, equal to, or greater than the corresponding element in the second tuple, but the function will return a tuple of bitwise AND operations instead.
