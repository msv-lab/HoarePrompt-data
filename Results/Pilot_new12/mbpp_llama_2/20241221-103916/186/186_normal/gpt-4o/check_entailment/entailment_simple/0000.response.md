Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples, which can be interpreted as performing an element-wise operation.

However, the provided program calculates the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from the two tuples. Bitwise AND operation is a binary operation that performs a bitwise AND operation on two integers, bit by bit.

There is no standard definition for "element-wise and" operation for tuples. However, considering the typical meaning of element-wise operations, it could be interpreted as a comparison operation. But the provided program does not perform any comparison operation. 

The given unit tests suggest that the desired output is actually the comparison of corresponding elements from the two tuples, where the result of each comparison is 1 if the element from the first tuple is greater and 0 otherwise, not their bitwise AND. But the provided program does not perform this operation either.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

If the problem description actually intended to ask for a function that performs an element-wise comparison of the two tuples and returns a tuple of the results, the correct program would be:

```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(int(a > b) for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
```
