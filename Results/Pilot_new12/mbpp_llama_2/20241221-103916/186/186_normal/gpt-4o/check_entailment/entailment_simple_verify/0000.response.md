The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it uses the bitwise AND operator (&) to calculate the result for each pair of corresponding elements from the input tuples, instead of calculating the element-wise minimum. 

Upon reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, it becomes clear that the original assessment is accurate. The problem description explicitly asks for a function to extract the element-wise minimum and tuples from two given tuples. However, the code provided calculates the bitwise AND of corresponding elements, not the minimum.

The annotated version of the code confirms this, stating that the program returns a tuple where each element is the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2. This operation does not align with the problem description's requirement of calculating the element-wise minimum.

For example, considering the function call `func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`, the expected result for the element-wise minimum would be `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, not `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is the result of the bitwise AND operation.

Therefore, based on the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements.

Final: **False**
