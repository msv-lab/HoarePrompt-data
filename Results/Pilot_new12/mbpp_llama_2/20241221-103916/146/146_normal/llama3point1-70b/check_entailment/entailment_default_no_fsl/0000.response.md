Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The main issue is with the handling of edge cases, such as when the input list is empty. In this scenario, the `max()` function will raise a `ValueError` because it cannot find the maximum value of an empty sequence. Although the hints suggest that the code handles cases where the input list is empty or contains empty sublists, it does not do so correctly.

Another issue is that the function returns only the first sublist with the maximum length, whereas the problem description asks for the list of maximum length in a list of lists, implying that all sublists with the maximum length should be returned. However, the function currently only returns the first one encountered.

To fix these issues and make the code correct, it should handle the case of an empty input list by returning a specific value or raising a custom exception with a meaningful message, and it should return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one. 

For example, the corrected function could be:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    if not list_of_lists:
        return None  # or raise a custom exception
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```
