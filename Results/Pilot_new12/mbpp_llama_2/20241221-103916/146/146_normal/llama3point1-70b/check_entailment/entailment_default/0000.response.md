Correctness: **False**.

The function does not entirely follow the problem description. It returns the maximum length of any sublist and only the first sublist with this maximum length, whereas the problem description asks for the list of maximum length in a list of lists, implying that all sublists with the maximum length should be returned. 

For example, given the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the function will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but the problem description expects the function to return all sublists of maximum length, which in this case are `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`. 

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case, making it incorrect.
