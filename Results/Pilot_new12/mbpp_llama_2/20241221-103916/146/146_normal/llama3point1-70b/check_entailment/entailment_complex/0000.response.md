Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for the function to return the list of maximum length in a list of lists. However, if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, the function should ideally return all of them. 

Instead, the provided function returns the maximum length and only the first sublist it encounters with this maximum length. This does not fully address the problem description's request for the "list of maximum length," which could be interpreted as returning all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one encountered.

To meet the problem description's requirements accurately, the function should return all sublists that have the maximum length, not just the first one. The corrected function would return `max_len` and `max_sublists` (the list of all sublists with the maximum length), not `max_sublists[0]` (just the first sublist with the maximum length).

For example, given the input `[[1,2,3], [4,5], [6,7,8]]`, the function should return `(3, [[1,2,3], [6,7,8]])`, indicating that the maximum length is `3` and the sublists with this maximum length are `[[1,2,3]]` and `[[6,7,8]]`. The current implementation would return `(3, [1,2,3])`, missing the second sublist of maximum length.
