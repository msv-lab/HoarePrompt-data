The given Python program is intended to find the maximum length of any sublist in a list of lists and return the first sublist with this maximum length.

However, the problem description requires the program to find the "list of maximum length in a list of lists", which implies that it should return all sublists with the maximum length. 

In the provided annotated program, `max_len` is correctly calculated as the maximum length of any sublist. The list comprehension `[sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]` also correctly generates a list of all sublists with this maximum length.

But, the function returns `max_len` and `max_sublists[0]`, which is only the first sublist with the maximum length, not all of them. This does not meet the problem description.

To meet the problem description, the function should return `max_len` and `max_sublists`, which would be all sublists with the maximum length.

Correctness: **False**

The reason is that the program only returns the first sublist with the maximum length, while the problem description requires it to return all sublists with the maximum length. 

Here is an example where the program does not follow the problem description:
```python
list_of_lists = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 3]]
max_len, max_sublist = func_1(list_of_lists)
print(max_sublist)  # prints: [1, 2, 3]
```
In this example, both `[1, 2, 3]` and `[6, 7, 3]` have the maximum length, but the program only returns `[1, 2, 3]`. 

To fix this, the function should be modified to return all sublists with the maximum length:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_len, max_sublists
```
