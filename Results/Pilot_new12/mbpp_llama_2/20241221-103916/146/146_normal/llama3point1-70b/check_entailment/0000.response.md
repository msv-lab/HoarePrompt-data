Correctness: **False**.

The given function is supposed to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but it only returns one of the sublists with the maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, it will only return the first one it encounters.

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the function will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return `(3, [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])` to meet the problem description.

The line `return (max_len, max_sublists[0])` should be changed to `return (max_len, max_sublists)` to fix this issue. This way, the function will return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists)
```
