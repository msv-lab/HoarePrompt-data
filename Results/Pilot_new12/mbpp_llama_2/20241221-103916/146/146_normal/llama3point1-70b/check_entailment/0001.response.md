Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists, but the program returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist with that maximum length.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length. For example, if the input is `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`, the program will return `(3, [1, 2, 3])`, but it should return all sublists with length 3, which are `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`.

The program should be modified to return all sublists with the maximum length, not just the first one. The corrected program would be:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return max_sublists
```
