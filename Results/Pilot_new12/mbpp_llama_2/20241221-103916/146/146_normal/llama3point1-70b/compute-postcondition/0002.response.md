The given code returns two values: `max_len` and `max_sublists[0]`. `max_len` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`. `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` where each sublist has a length of `max_len`, so `max_sublists[0]` refers to the first sublist in `list_of_lists` that has the maximum length.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum length of any sublist in 'list_of_lists' and the first sublist in 'list_of_lists' that has this maximum length**
