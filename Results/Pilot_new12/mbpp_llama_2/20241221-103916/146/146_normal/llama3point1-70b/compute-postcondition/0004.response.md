Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists as input, determines the maximum length of any sublist, identifies the first sublist with this maximum length, and returns both the maximum length and the first sublist of maximum length. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum length, only the first one encountered is returned. The function handles cases where the input list is empty or contains empty sublists, but in such cases, it may raise exceptions or return unexpected results, such as returning `0` as the maximum length if all sublists are empty. If the input list itself is empty, the function raises a `ValueError` due to the `max()` function with an empty sequence. The function does not modify the original input list or its sublists; it only returns information about them.**
