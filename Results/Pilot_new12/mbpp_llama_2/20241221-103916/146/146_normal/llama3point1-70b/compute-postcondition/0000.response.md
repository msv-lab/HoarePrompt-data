To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists.

The provided code is: `max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)`

This code calculates the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists` and assigns it to the variable `max_len`.

Therefore, `max_len` is assigned the value of the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`.

The state of `list_of_lists` is not changed, but a new variable `max_len` is introduced, which holds the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`**
