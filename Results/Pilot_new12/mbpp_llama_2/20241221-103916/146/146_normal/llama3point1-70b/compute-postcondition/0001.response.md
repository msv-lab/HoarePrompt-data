To find the output state, let's analyze the given code. The code creates a new list called `max_sublists` that includes only the sublists from `list_of_lists` where the length of the sublist is equal to `max_len`.

Given the initial state:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists.
- `max_len` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`.

After executing the code:
- `max_sublists` is a new list containing all sublists from `list_of_lists` with a length of `max_len`.
- The state of `list_of_lists` remains unchanged because it's not being modified by the code.
- The state of `max_len` also remains unchanged as it's used for comparison but not altered.

Therefore, the output state includes the original `list_of_lists` and `max_len`, along with the new list `max_sublists` which specifically contains sublists of length `max_len`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` where each sublist has a length of `max_len`.**
