Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program appears to be correct as it accurately finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists. Here's a breakdown of why the code works as expected:

1. The function `func_1` initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list. This sets the stage for finding the longest list.
2. It then iterates through each list in the input `list_of_lists`. For each list, it checks if the length of the current list (`len(lst)`) is greater than the currently known maximum length (`max_len`).
3. If it finds a list with a longer length, it updates `max_len` with this new length and assigns the current list to `max_list`.
4. After iterating through all lists, it returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the list that has this maximum length.

This approach ensures that the function will always find the list (or one of the lists if there are multiple with the same maximum length) with the maximum length in the provided list of lists. 

It correctly handles various cases, including:
- Lists of varying lengths.
- Empty lists, although the function does not explicitly check for these, its logic still applies as an empty list would have a length of 0, and if all lists are empty, it would return (0, []), which aligns with expectations for maximum length (even though it's a degenerate case).
- Lists containing a single element, which are valid inputs and are handled as intended.

Given the provided unit tests and the analysis of the code's logic, the function behaves as specified in the problem description for all potential cases considered. Therefore, the program is deemed correct based on the information and examples provided.
