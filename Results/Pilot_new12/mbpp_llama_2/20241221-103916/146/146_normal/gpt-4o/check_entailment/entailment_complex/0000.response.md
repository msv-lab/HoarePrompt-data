Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself. 

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The program initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list. This is a safe initialization because if the input list is empty, the function will correctly return a tuple with 0 and an empty list.

2. The program iterates over each list in the input list of lists. For each list, it checks if the length of the current list is greater than the current `max_len`. If it is, the program updates `max_len` with the length of the current list and updates `max_list` with the current list.

3. After iterating over all lists, `max_len` will hold the length of the longest list and `max_list` will hold the longest list itself. The program then returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`.

4. The program handles edge cases where the input list contains lists of varying lengths, and it correctly identifies the longest list even if there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, in which case it returns the first one it encounters.

5. The input list remains unchanged throughout the function's execution, which is in line with the problem description.

6. The function's output provides information about the longest list in the input, allowing the caller to access both the length and the contents of the longest list, which is what the problem description requires.

Overall, the program is correct because it always finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists and returns the required information, while handling edge cases and leaving the input list unchanged.
