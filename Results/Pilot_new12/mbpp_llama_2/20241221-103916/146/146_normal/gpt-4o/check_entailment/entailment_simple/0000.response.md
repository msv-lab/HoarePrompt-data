Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by initializing two variables, `max_len` and `max_list`, to keep track of the maximum length and the corresponding list, respectively. `max_len` is initialized to 0, and `max_list` is initialized to an empty list.

2. **Iteration**: The program then iterates over each list in the input `list_of_lists`. For each list, it checks if the length of the current list is greater than the current `max_len`.

3. **Update**: If the length of the current list is greater than `max_len`, the program updates `max_len` to the length of the current list and updates `max_list` to the current list. This ensures that `max_len` always stores the length of the longest list encountered so far, and `max_list` stores the longest list itself.

4. **Return**: After iterating over all lists, the program returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`. This tuple provides the length of the longest list and the longest list itself, as required by the problem description.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

* An empty input list: In this case, `max_len` remains 0, and `max_list` remains an empty list, which is the expected output.
* A list containing only one sublist: The program correctly identifies this sublist as the longest and returns its length and the sublist itself.
* A list containing multiple sublists of varying lengths: The program correctly identifies the longest sublist and returns its length and the sublist itself.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases, making it correct.
