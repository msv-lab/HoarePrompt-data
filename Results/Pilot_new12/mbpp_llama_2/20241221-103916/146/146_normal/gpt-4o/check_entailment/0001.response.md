Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates over each list in the input list of lists and checks if the length of the current list is greater than the maximum length found so far. If it is, the function updates the maximum length and the corresponding list.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

1. Empty input list: The function will return an empty list and a length of 0, which is correct.
2. Input list containing only one list: The function will return the length and the list itself, which is correct.
3. Input list containing multiple lists with the same maximum length: The function will return the length and the first list it encounters with that length, which is correct according to the problem description.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correct behavior of the function. Since we cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected, the program is considered correct.
