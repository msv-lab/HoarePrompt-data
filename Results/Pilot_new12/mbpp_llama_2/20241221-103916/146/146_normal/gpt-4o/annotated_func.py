#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, `max_len` is the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists` if `list_of_lists` is not empty, otherwise 0, and `max_list` is the longest list in `list_of_lists` if `list_of_lists` is not empty, otherwise an empty list.
    return max_len, max_list
    #The program returns a tuple containing `max_len` which is the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists` if `list_of_lists` is not empty, otherwise 0, and `max_list` which is the longest list in `list_of_lists` if `list_of_lists` is not empty, otherwise an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself. If the input list is empty, it returns a tuple with 0 and an empty list. The function handles edge cases where the input list contains lists of varying lengths, and it correctly identifies the longest list even if there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, in which case it returns the first one it encounters. The input list remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. The function's output provides information about the longest list in the input, allowing the caller to access both the length and the contents of the longest list.
