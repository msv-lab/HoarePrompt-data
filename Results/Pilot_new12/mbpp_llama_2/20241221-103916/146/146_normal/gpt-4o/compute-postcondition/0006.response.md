Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 list, `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`. If the length of `lst` is greater than the original `max_len` (which is 0), then `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst` and `max_list` is updated to `lst`. Otherwise, `max_len` remains 0 and `max_list` remains an empty list.***
