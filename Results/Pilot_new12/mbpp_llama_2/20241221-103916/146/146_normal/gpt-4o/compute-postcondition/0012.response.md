To solve this problem, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. The initial state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 3 lists, and `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`.
2. The code is: `max_len = len(lst)`.
   - This code assigns the length of `lst` (which is the third list in `list_of_lists`) to a new variable named `max_len`.
   - The value of `max_len` is now directly tied to the length of `lst`.
   - The states of `list_of_lists` and `lst` themselves are not changed; only a new variable `max_len` is introduced, holding the length of `lst`.

Given this analysis, we can conclude the following about the output state:

- `list_of_lists` remains a list of lists with at least 3 lists.
- `lst` remains the third list in `list_of_lists`.
- A new variable `max_len` is introduced, which holds the value equal to the length of `lst`.

Therefore, the output state, including all information from the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed and updating the values of variables that have been changed by the code, is:

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`.**
