Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself. If the input list is empty, it returns a tuple with 0 and an empty list. The function handles edge cases where the input list contains lists of varying lengths, and it correctly identifies the longest list even if there are multiple lists with the same maximum length, in which case it returns the first one it encounters. The input list remains unchanged throughout the function's execution. The function's output provides information about the longest list in the input, allowing the caller to access both the length and the contents of the longest list.**
