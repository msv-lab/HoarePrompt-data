The value of `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. The states of the other variables are not affected. `lst` is still the third list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_len` is still equal to the length of `lst`. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, and `max_list` is equal to `lst`.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 lists, `lst` is the third list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, and `max_list` is equal to `lst`**
