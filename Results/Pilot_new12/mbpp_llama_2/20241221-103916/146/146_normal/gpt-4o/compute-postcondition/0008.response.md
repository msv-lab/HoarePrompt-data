The code assigns the length of `lst` to `max_len`. The value of `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`. 

The states of `list_of_lists` and `lst` are not affected. 
`max_len` is now equal to the number of elements in `lst`. 
The initial state of `max_list` is not defined, but based on the problem description it might have some relation with the `max_len` that has been calculated, however, no update has been done to `max_list` so far.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is the number of elements in `lst`, `max_list` is still to be updated based on `max_len`.**
