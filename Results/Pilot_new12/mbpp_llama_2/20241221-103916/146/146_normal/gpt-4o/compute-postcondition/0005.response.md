The code assigns `max_list` the value of `lst`. The initial state of `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`. The states of `list_of_lists` and `max_len` are not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 list, `max_len` is equal to the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the first list in `list_of_lists`, `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`**
