Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`. If the length of `lst` is greater than the original `max_len`, then `max_len` is updated to the number of elements in `lst` and `max_list` is updated to `lst`. Otherwise, `max_len` and `max_list` retain their original values.***
