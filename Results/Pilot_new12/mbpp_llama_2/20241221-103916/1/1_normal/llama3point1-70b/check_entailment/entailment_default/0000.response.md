Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided performs the function as described in the problem statement, which is to find the shared elements from two given lists. The function `func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2)` uses the set intersection operation (`&`) to find the common unique elements between `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` and returns them as a tuple.

The output hints also align with the code's functionality, stating that the function returns a tuple of unique common elements, does not modify the original lists, and that it implicitly converts the input lists to sets, removing duplicates and not preserving the original order of elements.

Given that we assume valid input (i.e., the inputs are lists with hashable elements), the code handles all potential cases as described. It correctly returns an empty tuple when there are no common elements, and it does not include any explicit error checking for input type or validity, which is in line with the assumption of valid input.

The function's behavior, as described by the output hints and implemented in the code, matches the problem description of finding shared elements between two lists, considering the constraints and assumptions provided. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case under the given assumptions.
