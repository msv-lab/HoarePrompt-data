Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the function to find the shared elements from the given two lists. The function uses set intersection to find the common elements between the two input lists, which is an efficient approach. The use of sets also automatically removes any duplicate elements within each list.

The function handles cases where there are no common elements by returning an empty tuple, which is as expected. Additionally, the function does not modify the original input lists, which is also as specified in the problem description.

Although the function does not preserve the original order of elements from the input lists, this is not a requirement specified in the problem description. The function also assumes that all elements within the lists are hashable, as required by the set data structure, but this is a reasonable assumption given the context of the problem.

The output hints provided agree with the code's behavior, and there are no obvious edge cases that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to be correct for every potential case.
