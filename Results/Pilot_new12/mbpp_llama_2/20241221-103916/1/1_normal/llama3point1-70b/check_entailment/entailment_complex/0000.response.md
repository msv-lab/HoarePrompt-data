Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks for a function to find the shared elements from two given lists. The provided function, `func_1`, takes two lists as input, converts them to sets (which removes any duplicate elements within each list), finds the intersection of these sets (which gives the elements common to both lists), and returns this intersection as a tuple.

The function's behavior aligns with the problem description in the following ways:

1. **Finding Shared Elements**: By using the set intersection operation (`&`), the function correctly identifies elements that are present in both input lists. This directly addresses the requirement to find shared elements.

2. **Returning Unique Elements**: Since sets automatically eliminate duplicate values, any element that appears multiple times in one or both of the input lists will only appear once in the result. The conversion of the resulting set back to a tuple maintains this uniqueness.

3. **Handling No Common Elements**: If there are no elements common to both lists, the set intersection will be an empty set, which when converted to a tuple, results in an empty tuple. This behavior is consistent with the expectation for handling cases with no common elements.

4. **Not Modifying Original Lists**: The function uses set operations, which do not modify the original lists. This is in line with the problem's implicit expectation that the original input should not be altered.

5. **Assumption of Valid Input**: Given the problem statement's assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., two lists), the function does not include error checking for invalid inputs. This assumption allows the function to focus solely on finding the shared elements without concern for handling non-list inputs or other potential errors.

In summary, the program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement: it finds and returns the unique shared elements between two input lists without modifying the lists, under the assumption of valid input.
