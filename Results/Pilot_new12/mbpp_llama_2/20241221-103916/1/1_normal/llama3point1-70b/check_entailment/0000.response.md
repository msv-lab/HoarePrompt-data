Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two input lists. It uses the set intersection operation (`&`) to achieve this. The function first converts the input tuples to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements. Then, it applies the set intersection operation to find the common elements between the two sets. Finally, it converts the resulting set back to a tuple and returns it.

This function works correctly for all possible input cases, including:

- When the input lists have common elements, the function returns the shared elements as a tuple.
- When the input lists do not have any common elements, the function returns an empty tuple.
- When the input lists contain duplicate elements, the function still returns the shared elements correctly, since sets automatically remove duplicates.

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 3, 2), (2, 3, 4))`, the function will return `(2, 3)`, which are the shared elements between the two input lists. If we call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))`, the function will return `()`, indicating that there are no shared elements between the two input lists.

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all possible input cases.
