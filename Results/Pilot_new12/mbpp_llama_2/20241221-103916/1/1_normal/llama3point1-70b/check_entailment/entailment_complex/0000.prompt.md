You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are lists.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple of unique elements common to both test_tup1 and test_tup2 lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are expected to be lists, and returns a tuple containing unique elements that are common to both input lists. The function does not modify the original input lists. It handles cases where there are no common elements by returning an empty tuple. It also implicitly converts the input lists to sets, which means it removes any duplicate elements within each list before finding the intersection, resulting in a tuple with unique common elements. Additionally, it does not preserve the original order of elements from the input lists, as the set intersection operation does not maintain element order. The function does not include any error checking to verify that the inputs are indeed lists, and it assumes that all elements within the lists are hashable, as required by the set data structure.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
