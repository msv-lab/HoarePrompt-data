Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists. In this case, the lists are represented as tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`). The function works by converting each tuple into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements within each set, and then performing a set intersection operation (`&`) to find the elements common to both sets. The result is returned as a tuple.

Here's why this function is correct for every potential case:

1. **Handling Shared Elements**: If there are elements common to both tuples, the set intersection will correctly identify these and return them. For example, if `test_tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `test_tup2 = (2, 3, 4)`, the function will return `(2, 3)`, which are the shared elements.

2. **Handling No Shared Elements**: If there are no elements common to both tuples, the set intersection will return an empty set, which is then converted to an empty tuple. For instance, if `test_tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `test_tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`, the function will return `()`, correctly indicating there are no shared elements.

3. **Handling Duplicate Elements**: Since the function converts the tuples to sets, any duplicate elements within a tuple are automatically removed before the set intersection is performed. This means the function correctly handles tuples with duplicates. For example, if `test_tup1 = (1, 2, 2, 3)` and `test_tup2 = (2, 3, 4)`, the function will return `(2, 3)`, which is the correct set of shared elements without duplicates.

4. **Handling Empty Tuples**: If either or both of the input tuples are empty, the function will still work correctly. The set intersection of an empty set with any set is an empty set. So, if `test_tup1 = ()` and `test_tup2 = (1, 2, 3)`, or if both tuples are empty, the function will return `()`, which is the expected result.

Given that this function handles shared elements, no shared elements, duplicate elements, and empty tuples correctly, and it aligns with the problem description of finding shared elements from two lists (tuples in this implementation), it is considered correct for all potential cases.
