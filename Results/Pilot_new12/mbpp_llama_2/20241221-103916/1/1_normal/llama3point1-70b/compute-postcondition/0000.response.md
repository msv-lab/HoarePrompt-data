To determine the output state, let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

Given:
- `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are lists.

Code:
```python
return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
```

This code does the following:
1. Converts `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` into sets. A set in Python is an unordered collection of unique elements.
2. Finds the intersection of the two sets using the `&` operator. This intersection includes only the elements that are common to both sets.
3. Converts the resulting set back into a tuple.
4. Returns this tuple.

Since `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are described as lists but the operation involves converting them into sets (which automatically removes any duplicate elements) and then finding their intersection, the output will be a tuple containing the unique elements that are common to both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple of unique elements common to both test_tup1 and test_tup2 lists.**
