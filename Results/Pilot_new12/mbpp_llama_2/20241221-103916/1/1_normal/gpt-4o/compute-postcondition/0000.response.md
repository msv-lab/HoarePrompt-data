The code calculates the common elements between `list1` and `list2` using the set intersection operation `&`. 

The `set(list1)` and `set(list2)` expressions convert the input lists into sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements. The `&` operator then returns a new set containing only the elements that are present in both sets.

The result of this operation is assigned to the `common_elements` variable.

Output State: **`list1` is a list, `list2` is a list, `common_elements` is a set of elements common to `list1` and `list2`, equal to `set(list1) & set(list2)`**
