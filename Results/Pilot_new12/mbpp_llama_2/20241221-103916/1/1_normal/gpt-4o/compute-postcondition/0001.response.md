To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

Given that `common_elements` is a set of elements common to `list1` and `list2`, equal to `set(list1) & set(list2)`, this means `common_elements` contains unique elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`.

The code snippet `return tuple(sorted(common_elements))` does the following:
1. `sorted(common_elements)`: This sorts the elements in `common_elements` in ascending order. Since `common_elements` is a set, its elements are first converted into a list (or another sortable data structure) before being sorted.
2. `tuple(...)`: The sorted list of common elements is then converted into a tuple.

Therefore, the program returns a tuple containing all the elements that are common to `list1` and `list2`, with these elements sorted in ascending order.

Output State: **The program returns a tuple of elements common to `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order.**
