Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment that the program is correct. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input and returns a tuple of the shared elements from the two lists, sorted in ascending order. The use of sets automatically eliminates any duplicate elements, and the sorting ensures that the result is in a consistent order.

The output hints confirm that the function handles various cases correctly, such as:

* Removing duplicate elements by converting the input lists to sets
* Returning an empty tuple if `list1` and `list2` have no common elements
* Handling unsorted input lists by sorting the common elements before returning them
* Not modifying the original input lists, as it only returns a new tuple containing the common elements

The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the program, covering different scenarios such as lists with multiple shared elements, overlapping and non-overlapping elements, and elements in different orders.

I maintain the original assessment because the program meets the problem description, and the output hints support the correctness of the program. The code is well-structured, and the use of sets and sorting ensures that the result is accurate and consistent.

Final: **True**
