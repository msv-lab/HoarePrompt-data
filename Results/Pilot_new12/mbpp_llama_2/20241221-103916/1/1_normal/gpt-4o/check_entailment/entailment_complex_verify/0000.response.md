The original assessment of the program appears to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly finds the shared elements from two given lists by converting the input lists to sets, finding their intersection, and returning the common elements as a tuple sorted in ascending order.

The annotated version of the code supports this assessment, providing additional details on the state of the program at different points. It confirms that the function accepts two lists, removes duplicates by converting them to sets, finds the common elements, and returns them as a sorted tuple.

The key points that justify the correctness of the program are:

1. **Duplicate Handling**: The function correctly handles duplicate elements in the input lists by converting them to sets, which automatically removes duplicates.
2. **Unsorted Input Lists**: The function correctly handles unsorted input lists by sorting the common elements before returning them.
3. **No Common Elements**: The function correctly handles cases where the input lists have no common elements, returning an empty tuple.
4. **Original Lists Unmodified**: The function does not modify the original input lists, ensuring that the original data remains unchanged.
5. **Sorted Output**: The function returns the common elements in a sorted tuple, which matches the problem's requirement for sorted output.

The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both support the conclusion that the function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality. There is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is incorrect, and the annotations provide further clarification on the program's behavior.

Final: **True**
