You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the shared elements from the given two lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 4, 3, 7)) == (3, 4)
assert func_1((11, 12, 14, 13), (17, 15, 14, 13)) == (13, 14)

def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input and returns a tuple of the shared elements from the two lists. The function uses the set intersection operation (`&`) to find the common elements between the two sets. The result is then sorted and returned as a tuple.

The program is correct because it handles all potential cases as described in the problem description. It correctly finds the shared elements between two lists, regardless of the order or number of elements in the lists. The use of sets automatically eliminates any duplicate elements, and the sorting ensures that the result is in a consistent order.

The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the program, covering different scenarios such as:

* Lists with multiple shared elements
* Lists with overlapping and non-overlapping elements
* Lists with elements in different orders

After reviewing the code and considering various potential cases, I couldn't find any scenario where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists, and returns a tuple of elements common to `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order. The function handles duplicate elements by removing them, as it converts the input lists to sets before finding common elements. If `list1` and `list2` have no common elements, the function will return an empty tuple. The function also handles unsorted input lists, as it sorts the common elements before returning them. Additionally, the function does not modify the original input lists, as it only returns a new tuple containing the common elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
