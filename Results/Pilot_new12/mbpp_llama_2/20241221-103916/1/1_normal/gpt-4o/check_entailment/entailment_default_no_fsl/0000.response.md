Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements a function to find the shared elements from two given lists. It converts the input lists to sets, finds the common elements using the intersection operator (&), and returns them as a sorted tuple. This approach ensures that duplicate elements are removed and the common elements are returned in ascending order. 

The function also handles unsorted input lists and does not modify the original input lists. The output hints agree with the code's functionality, and the provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness for various test cases.

Since the problem description does not specify any constraints on the input lists (e.g., empty lists, lists with non-numeric elements), and assuming that the input will be valid, the code correctly implements the required functionality for every potential case. 

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and problem description, the function is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
