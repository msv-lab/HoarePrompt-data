Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly find the shared elements from two given lists. It converts the input lists to sets, finds their intersection using the `&` operator, and returns the common elements as a tuple sorted in ascending order. 

This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Lists with duplicate elements: Since sets automatically eliminate duplicates, the function will only consider unique elements.
- Lists with elements in different orders: The function sorts the common elements before returning them, so the order of elements in the input lists does not affect the result.
- Lists with no common elements: In such cases, the function will correctly return an empty tuple.
- Empty lists: The function will also correctly handle empty lists and return an empty tuple if there are no common elements.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function, as they cover various scenarios, including lists with common elements in different positions and lists with no common elements.

Overall, based on the analysis and the provided unit tests, it appears that the function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality.
