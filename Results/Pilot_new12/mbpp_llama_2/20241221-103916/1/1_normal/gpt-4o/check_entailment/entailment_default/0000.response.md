Correctness: **True**

The code defines a function `func_1` that finds the shared elements from two given lists. The function converts the input lists to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements. It then finds the intersection of the two sets using the `&` operator, which gives the elements common to both sets. The common elements are sorted in ascending order using the `sorted` function and returned as a tuple.

The output hints agree with the code and describe the functionality correctly. The function handles duplicate elements by removing them, unsorted input lists by sorting the common elements, and does not modify the original input lists. If the input lists have no common elements, the function returns an empty tuple.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, the test `assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)` shows that the function correctly identifies the common elements `(4, 5)` and returns them in sorted order.

Since we assume that the input will be valid, we don't need to consider cases where the input lists are empty or not lists. The function will work correctly for any valid input lists. Therefore, the code does what the problem description says for every potential case, and the correctness is **True**.
