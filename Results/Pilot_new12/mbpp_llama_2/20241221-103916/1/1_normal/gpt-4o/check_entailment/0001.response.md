Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input and returns a tuple of the shared elements from the two lists. The function uses the set intersection operation (`&`) to find the common elements between the two sets. The result is then sorted and returned as a tuple.

The program is correct because it handles all potential cases as described in the problem description. It correctly finds the shared elements between two lists, regardless of the order or number of elements in the lists. The use of sets automatically eliminates any duplicate elements, and the sorting ensures that the result is in a consistent order.

The provided unit tests also validate the correctness of the program, covering different scenarios such as:

* Lists with multiple shared elements
* Lists with overlapping and non-overlapping elements
* Lists with elements in different orders

After reviewing the code and considering various potential cases, I couldn't find any scenario where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
