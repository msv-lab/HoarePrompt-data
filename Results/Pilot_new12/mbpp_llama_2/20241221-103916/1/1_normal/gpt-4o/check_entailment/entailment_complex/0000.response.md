Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to find the shared elements from two given lists, and the program does exactly that.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. It converts the input lists to sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements.
2. It uses the `&` operator to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives the elements common to both lists.
3. It converts the resulting set back to a tuple and sorts it in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
4. It returns the tuple of common elements.

The program handles various scenarios correctly, including:

* Duplicate elements: By converting the lists to sets, duplicate elements are automatically removed.
* Unsorted input lists: The program sorts the common elements before returning them, so the output is always in ascending order.
* No common elements: If the lists have no common elements, the program returns an empty tuple.
* Different data types: Since the program uses sets, it can handle lists of any data type that can be hashed, such as integers, floats, strings, etc.

Overall, the program correctly finds the shared elements from two given lists, sorted in ascending order, and returns them as a tuple.
