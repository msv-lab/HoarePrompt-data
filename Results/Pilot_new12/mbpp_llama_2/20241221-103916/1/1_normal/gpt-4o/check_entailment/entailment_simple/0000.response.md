Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the shared elements from two given lists. Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Conversion to sets**: The function converts the input lists `list1` and `list2` to sets using the `set()` function. This is an efficient way to find common elements because sets in Python have an average time complexity of O(1) for lookups.

2. **Finding common elements**: The `&` operator is used to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives a new set containing only the elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`.

3. **Sorting and returning as a tuple**: The common elements are then sorted in ascending order using the `sorted()` function, and the result is returned as a tuple.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different input cases. For example, the test `assert func_1((3, 4, 5, 6), (5, 7, 4, 10)) == (4, 5)` shows that the function correctly identifies the common elements `(4, 5)` and returns them in sorted order.

Since the function works as expected for all potential cases, it is correct according to the problem description. The assumption that the input will be valid and not cause any errors in the program also holds, as we are only evaluating the correctness of the function based on the provided problem description and unit tests.
