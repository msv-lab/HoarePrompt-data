The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists, and returns a tuple of elements common to `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order. The function handles duplicate elements by removing them, as it converts the input lists to sets before finding common elements. If `list1` and `list2` have no common elements, the function will return an empty tuple. The function also handles unsorted input lists, as it sorts the common elements before returning them. Additionally, the function does not modify the original input lists, as it only returns a new tuple containing the common elements.
