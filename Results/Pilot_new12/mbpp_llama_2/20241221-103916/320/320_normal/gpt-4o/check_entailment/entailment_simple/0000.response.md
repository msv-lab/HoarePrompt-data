Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why it works for every potential case:

1. It first creates a set of unique numbers from the input list `nums` using `set(nums)`. This removes any duplicate numbers from the list.
2. It then sorts this set of unique numbers in ascending order using `sorted()`.
3. If the length of the sorted set of unique numbers is more than 1, it returns the second smallest number, which is at index 1 (`unique_nums[1]`).
4. If the length of the sorted set of unique numbers is not more than 1, it means there is only one unique number in the list, so it returns `None`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

- If the list has more than one distinct number, it returns the second smallest number.
- If the list has only one distinct number, it returns `None`.

The given unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function:

- `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2` because -2 is the second smallest number in the list after removing duplicates and sorting.
- `func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5` because -0.5 is the second smallest unique number in the list.
- `func_1([2, 2]) == None` and `func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None` because there is only one unique number in the list, so there is no second smallest number.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases as expected.
