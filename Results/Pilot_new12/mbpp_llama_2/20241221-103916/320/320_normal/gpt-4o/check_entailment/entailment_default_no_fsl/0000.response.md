Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. It first removes duplicates from the input list by converting it to a set, then sorts the unique numbers in ascending order. If there are at least two distinct integers in the list, it returns the second smallest unique integer; otherwise, it returns None.

The unit tests provided also support this conclusion. They cover cases where the list contains negative numbers, duplicate numbers, and less than two distinct integers. In all these cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

The function is handling edge cases correctly. For example, when the list contains less than two distinct integers (as in the cases of `[2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 2]`), the function correctly returns None. This is because there is no second smallest unique integer in these cases.

The output hints also align with the code's behavior, describing how the function accepts a list of integers, removes duplicates, sorts them, and returns the second smallest unique integer if it exists, or None otherwise. 

Therefore, based on the provided problem description, code, and output hints, it appears that the function correctly implements the required functionality for every potential case, assuming valid input.
