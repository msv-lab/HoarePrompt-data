Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it effectively finds the second smallest number in a list. It first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, then sorts the unique numbers. If there are more than one unique number, it returns the second smallest number (at index 1 in the sorted list). If there is only one unique number, it returns None.

This approach handles edge cases such as lists with duplicate numbers, lists with negative numbers, and lists with fewer than two unique numbers. The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness in these cases. For example, in the test `assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2`, the function correctly identifies -2 as the second smallest number. In the test `assert func_1([2, 2]) == None`, the function correctly returns None because there is only one unique number.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the required functionality. Without being able to find a counterexample, it's reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
