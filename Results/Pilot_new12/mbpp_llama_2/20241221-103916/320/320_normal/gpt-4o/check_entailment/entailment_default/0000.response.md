Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the functionality to find the second smallest number in a list, as per the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown:

1. The function accepts a list of integers as input and removes duplicates by converting the list to a set.
2. It then sorts the unique integers in ascending order using the `sorted` function.
3. If the list contains at least two distinct integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer by indexing `unique_nums` at position `1` (since indexing in Python starts at `0`).
4. If the list contains less than two distinct integers, it returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest unique integer.

All the provided unit tests seem to be correctly handled by the function:

- `func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2` returns the second smallest unique integer.
- `func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5` returns the second smallest unique integer.
- `func_1([2, 2]) == None` and `func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None` both return `None` as there is no second smallest unique integer.

The code correctly handles all the potential cases, assuming valid input as specified in the problem description. The output hints also align with the code's behavior, further supporting the correctness of the implementation.
