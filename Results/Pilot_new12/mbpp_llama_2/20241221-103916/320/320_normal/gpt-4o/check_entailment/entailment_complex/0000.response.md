To verify the program, we need to check if it correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description.

The problem description asks for a function to find the second smallest number in a list. The function should return `None` if the list contains less than two distinct integers.

The provided annotated program uses the following steps to solve the problem:

1. It converts the input list to a set, which removes duplicates, and stores it in `unique_nums`.
2. It sorts `unique_nums` in ascending order.
3. If `unique_nums` contains more than one element, it returns the second smallest number (at index 1). Otherwise, it returns `None`.

This approach correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

- The program correctly removes duplicates from the input list by converting it to a set.
- It sorts the unique numbers in ascending order, which is necessary to find the second smallest number.
- It correctly handles the case where the list contains less than two distinct integers by returning `None` in such cases.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- The first test case `assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2` checks if the function correctly returns the second smallest number when there are multiple distinct integers.
- The second test case `assert func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5` checks if the function correctly handles the presence of duplicate numbers and returns the second smallest unique number.
- The third and fourth test cases `assert func_1([2, 2]) == None` and `assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None` check if the function correctly returns `None` when there is only one distinct integer in the list.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
