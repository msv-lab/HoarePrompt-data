The function accepts a list of integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the unique integers in ascending order, and returns the second smallest unique integer if at least two distinct integers exist in the list. If the list contains less than two distinct integers, the function returns None, indicating that there is no second smallest unique integer. The input list remains unchanged.
