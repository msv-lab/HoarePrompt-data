The code creates a new variable `unique_nums` which is assigned the value of a set of `nums` converted to a list and sorted. The set of `nums` removes any duplicate elements, and the sorted function sorts the remaining elements in ascending order. 

The initial state specifies that `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements. This means that the set of `nums` will have at least two elements, and the sorted function will sort these elements in ascending order.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from `nums`**
