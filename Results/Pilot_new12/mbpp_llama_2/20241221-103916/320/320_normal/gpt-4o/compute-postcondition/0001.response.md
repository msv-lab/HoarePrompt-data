To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state tells us that `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, and `unique_nums` is a sorted list of unique integers from `nums`. This means `unique_nums` will also have at least two elements because it is derived from `nums` and contains only unique integers.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
```

Given that `unique_nums` is a sorted list and has at least two distinct elements (because `nums` has at least two distinct elements), `len(unique_nums)` will always be greater than 1. Therefore, the condition `len(unique_nums) > 1` will always be `True`, and the code will return `unique_nums[1]`.

`unique_nums[1]` refers to the second element in the sorted list `unique_nums`. Since `unique_nums` is sorted, this means `unique_nums[1]` is the second smallest unique integer in `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.**
