#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input, removes duplicates, sorts the unique integers in ascending order, and returns the second smallest unique integer if at least two distinct integers exist in the list. If the list contains less than two distinct integers, the function returns None, indicating that there is no second smallest unique integer. The input list remains unchanged.
