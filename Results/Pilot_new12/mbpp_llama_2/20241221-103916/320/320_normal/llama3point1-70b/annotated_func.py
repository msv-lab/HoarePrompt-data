#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of distinct integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `nums` is a list of distinct integers with at least two elements, `unique_nums` is equal to `nums`, and the length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest integer in the list of distinct integers `unique_nums` (which is equal to `nums`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, removes duplicates, and checks if the resulting list has at least two unique elements. If not, it returns None. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest integer in the list of unique integers. The function handles edge cases where the input list may contain duplicate integers and returns None when the list has less than two unique elements. The state of the program after execution is that the input list remains unchanged, and the function returns either None or the second smallest integer.
