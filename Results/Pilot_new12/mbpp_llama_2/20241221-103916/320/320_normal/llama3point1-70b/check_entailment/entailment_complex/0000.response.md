Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description because it correctly finds the second smallest number in a list of distinct integers with at least two elements. 

Here are the key points that justify the correctness of the program:

1. **Removal of duplicates:** The program uses a set (`unique_nums = list(set(nums))`) to remove duplicates from the input list, which is in line with the problem description.

2. **Handling of edge cases:** The program checks if the resulting list has at least two unique elements (`if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :`) and returns `None` if not, thus handling edge cases.

3. **Finding the second smallest integer:** The program sorts the list of unique integers (`sorted(unique_nums)`) and returns the second smallest integer (`[1]`), which meets the problem description.

Since the program handles all potential cases (removal of duplicates, edge cases, and finding the second smallest integer) as specified in the problem description, it is correct. 

The program does not need to handle invalid inputs (like an empty list or a non-list input) because, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the annotated code, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
