You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program provided correctly implements a function to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. It first creates a list of unique numbers from the input list using `set(nums)`. This is necessary because if the input list has duplicate numbers, we want to consider each number only once.

2. It checks if the list has less than 2 unique numbers. If it does, the function returns `None` because there is no second smallest number in this case.

3. If the list has at least 2 unique numbers, the function sorts the list of unique numbers and returns the second smallest number, which is the number at index 1 (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`).

This implementation covers all possible cases:

- If the list has no duplicates, the function correctly finds the second smallest number.
- If the list has duplicates, the function correctly ignores the duplicates and finds the second smallest unique number.
- If the list has less than 2 unique numbers, the function correctly returns `None`.
- If the list is empty, the function correctly returns `None` (because `set(nums)` will be an empty set and `sorted(unique_nums)` will be an empty list).

Overall, the program is correct and will work as expected for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of distinct integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `nums` is a list of distinct integers with at least two elements, `unique_nums` is equal to `nums`, and the length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest integer in the list of distinct integers `unique_nums` (which is equal to `nums`)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, removes duplicates, and checks if the resulting list has at least two unique elements. If not, it returns None. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest integer in the list of unique integers. The function handles edge cases where the input list may contain duplicate integers and returns None when the list has less than two unique elements. The state of the program after execution is that the input list remains unchanged, and the function returns either None or the second smallest integer.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
