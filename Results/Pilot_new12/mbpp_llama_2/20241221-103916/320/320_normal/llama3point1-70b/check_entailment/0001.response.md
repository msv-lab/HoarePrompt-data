Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. The function first removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set and then back to a list (`unique_nums = list(set(nums))`). This is necessary because the problem statement asks for the second smallest unique number.

2. It then checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If it is, the function returns `None`, because there is no second smallest number in this case. This handles the edge cases where the list has less than two unique elements.

3. If `unique_nums` has two or more elements, the function sorts the list and returns the second element (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`). This correctly finds the second smallest unique number in the list.

The function correctly handles all potential cases, including empty lists, lists with a single element, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with two or more unique elements. It also correctly handles the case where there is no second smallest number (i.e., when the list has less than two unique elements). 

For example, if the input is `[4, 2, 9, 6, 5, 1, 8, 3, 7]`, the function will correctly return `2`. If the input is `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`, the function will correctly return `None`. Therefore, the function meets the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.
