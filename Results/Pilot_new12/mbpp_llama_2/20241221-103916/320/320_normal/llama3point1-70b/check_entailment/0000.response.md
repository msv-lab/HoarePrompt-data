Correctness: **True**.

The program provided correctly implements a function to find the second smallest number in a list. Here's why:

1. It first creates a list of unique numbers from the input list using `set(nums)`. This is necessary because if the input list has duplicate numbers, we want to consider each number only once.

2. It checks if the list has less than 2 unique numbers. If it does, the function returns `None` because there is no second smallest number in this case.

3. If the list has at least 2 unique numbers, the function sorts the list of unique numbers and returns the second smallest number, which is the number at index 1 (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`).

This implementation covers all possible cases:

- If the list has no duplicates, the function correctly finds the second smallest number.
- If the list has duplicates, the function correctly ignores the duplicates and finds the second smallest unique number.
- If the list has less than 2 unique numbers, the function correctly returns `None`.
- If the list is empty, the function correctly returns `None` (because `set(nums)` will be an empty set and `sorted(unique_nums)` will be an empty list).

Overall, the program is correct and will work as expected for all possible inputs.
