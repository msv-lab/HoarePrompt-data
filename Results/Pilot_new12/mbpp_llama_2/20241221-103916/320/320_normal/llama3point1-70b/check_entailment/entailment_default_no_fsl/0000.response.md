Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and then back to a list, checks if there are at least two unique integers, and returns the second smallest integer if the condition is met. Otherwise, it returns `None`.

The output hints provided agree with the code's functionality. The function handles edge cases where the input list may contain duplicate integers and returns `None` when the list has less than two unique elements. The state of the program after execution is that the input list remains unchanged, and the function returns either `None` or the second smallest integer.

The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, assuming valid input. It removes duplicates, checks for at least two unique elements, and returns the second smallest integer or `None` accordingly. Since the problem description does not specify handling invalid inputs (such as non-list inputs or lists with non-integer values), and we assume the user will always provide a valid input, the code is considered correct.
