The code `unique_nums = list(set(nums))` creates a new list called `unique_nums` which contains the unique elements of the list `nums`. Since `nums` is a list of distinct integers, `unique_nums` will be equal to `nums`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`nums` is a list of distinct integers with at least two elements, `unique_nums` is equal to `nums`**
