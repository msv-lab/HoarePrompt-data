The `unique_nums` is equal to `nums` and its length is greater than or equal to 2. Since `nums` is a list of distinct integers, `unique_nums` will also be a list of distinct integers. The code `sorted(unique_nums)[1]` will return the second smallest integer in the `unique_nums` list. 

Output State: **The program returns the second smallest integer in the list of distinct integers `unique_nums` (which is equal to `nums`)**
