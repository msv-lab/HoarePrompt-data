The function accepts three lists of comparable elements as input, combines them into a single list, sorts the combined list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The input lists (list1, list2, list3) remain unchanged. The function handles lists containing integers, floats, or strings, and it does not distinguish between these types as long as the elements within the combined list can be compared. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it assumes that the inputs are indeed lists and that the elements within these lists can be compared. If the inputs are not lists or if the lists contain uncomparable elements, the function may raise an exception. The function returns a new sorted list and does not modify the original lists. It includes all elements from the input lists in the output, including duplicates if any exist across the input lists.
