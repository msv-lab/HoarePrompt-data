Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists as input and returns a single sorted list. The function uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the combined list of elements from the three input lists.

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Sorting**: The `sorted` function is used to sort the combined list in ascending order, which is the expected behavior for a sorting function.

2. **List Concatenation**: The `+` operator is used to concatenate the three input lists into a single list, which is then sorted.

3. **Example Cases**: The function works correctly for various example cases, such as:
   - Empty lists: `func_1([], [], [])` returns `[]`
   - Lists with duplicate elements: `func_1([1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4])` returns `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Lists with negative numbers: `func_1([-1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 2])` returns `[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`
   - Lists with non-integer elements: `func_1(['a', 'b'], ['b', 'c'], ['c', 'd'])` returns `['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd']`

Since the program works correctly for all possible cases and does not have any missing logic or edge cases, it is considered correct.
