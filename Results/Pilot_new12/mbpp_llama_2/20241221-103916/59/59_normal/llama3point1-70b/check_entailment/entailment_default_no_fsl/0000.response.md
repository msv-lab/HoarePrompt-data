Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the function to merge three lists into a single sorted list. It uses Python's built-in `sorted()` function and list concatenation (`+`) to combine the input lists and sort the combined list in ascending order.

The function handles lists containing integers, floats, or strings, as long as the elements within the combined list can be compared. This means that the function will work correctly as long as the input lists contain elements of the same type or elements that can be compared (e.g., integers and floats).

The function does not modify the original lists and returns a new sorted list, including duplicates if they exist across the input lists. This aligns with the problem description and the output hints provided.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or contains uncomparable elements. Therefore, the code provided meets the requirements of the problem description and will work correctly for every potential case, given valid input.
