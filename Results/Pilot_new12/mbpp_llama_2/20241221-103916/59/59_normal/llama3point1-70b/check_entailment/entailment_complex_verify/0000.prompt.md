You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function, `func_1`, merges three lists into a single sorted list. Here's why it is correct:

- It correctly concatenates the three input lists using the `+` operator, resulting in a single list containing all elements from the input lists.
- It then uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort this combined list in ascending order.
- This approach works for any input lists, regardless of their lengths or the types of elements they contain (as long as the elements are comparable).
- It handles the case where one or more of the input lists are empty, as the `sorted` function will simply sort the non-empty list(s).
- It also correctly handles lists containing duplicate elements, as the `sorted` function is stable and will maintain the relative order of equal elements.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases, including lists with different lengths, empty lists, and lists containing duplicate or non-comparable elements, it is considered correct. The function meets the problem description's requirements for every potential case, so no counterexample can be found where the program does not work as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of elements that can be compared, such as integers, floats, or strings.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all elements from list1, list2, and list3 in ascending order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three lists of comparable elements as input, combines them into a single list, sorts the combined list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The input lists (list1, list2, list3) remain unchanged. The function handles lists containing integers, floats, or strings, and it does not distinguish between these types as long as the elements within the combined list can be compared. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it assumes that the inputs are indeed lists and that the elements within these lists can be compared. If the inputs are not lists or if the lists contain uncomparable elements, the function may raise an exception. The function returns a new sorted list and does not modify the original lists. It includes all elements from the input lists in the output, including duplicates if any exist across the input lists.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
