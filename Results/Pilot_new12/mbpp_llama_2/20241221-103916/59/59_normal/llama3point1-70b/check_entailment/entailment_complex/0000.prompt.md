You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of elements that can be compared, such as integers, floats, or strings.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all elements from list1, list2, and list3 in ascending order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three lists of comparable elements as input, combines them into a single list, sorts the combined list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The input lists (list1, list2, list3) remain unchanged. The function handles lists containing integers, floats, or strings, and it does not distinguish between these types as long as the elements within the combined list can be compared. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it assumes that the inputs are indeed lists and that the elements within these lists can be compared. If the inputs are not lists or if the lists contain uncomparable elements, the function may raise an exception. The function returns a new sorted list and does not modify the original lists. It includes all elements from the input lists in the output, including duplicates if any exist across the input lists.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
