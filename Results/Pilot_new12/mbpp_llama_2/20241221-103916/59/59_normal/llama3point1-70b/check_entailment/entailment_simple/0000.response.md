Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input and returns a single sorted list containing all elements from the three input lists.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function concatenates the three input lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` into a single list using the `+` operator.
2. The `sorted` function is then applied to this concatenated list, which sorts its elements in ascending order.
3. The sorted list is then returned by the function.

This approach works for any type of elements that can be compared, such as integers, floats, or strings, which is in line with the problem description.

For example, if we call the function with the following lists:

```python
list1 = [1, 3, 5]
list2 = [2, 4, 6]
list3 = [0, 7, 8]
```

The function will return:

```
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

Which is the expected sorted list containing all elements from the three input lists.

Since the program correctly implements the required functionality for any valid input, it meets the problem description, and its correctness is **True**.
