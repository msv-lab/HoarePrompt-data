You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists as input and returns a single sorted list. The function uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the combined list of elements from the three input lists.

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Here are a few reasons why:

1. **Sorting**: The `sorted` function is used to sort the combined list in ascending order, which is the expected behavior for a sorting function.

2. **List Concatenation**: The `+` operator is used to concatenate the three input lists into a single list, which is then sorted.

3. **Example Cases**: The function works correctly for various example cases, such as:
   - Empty lists: `func_1([], [], [])` returns `[]`
   - Lists with duplicate elements: `func_1([1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4])` returns `[1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4]`
   - Lists with negative numbers: `func_1([-1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 2])` returns `[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2]`
   - Lists with non-integer elements: `func_1(['a', 'b'], ['b', 'c'], ['c', 'd'])` returns `['a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'd']`

Since the program works correctly for all possible cases and does not have any missing logic or edge cases, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three lists of comparable elements as input, combines them into a single list, sorts the combined list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The input lists (list1, list2, list3) remain unchanged. The function handles lists containing integers, floats, or strings, and it does not distinguish between these types as long as the elements within the combined list can be compared. The function does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it assumes that the inputs are indeed lists and that the elements within these lists can be compared. If the inputs are not lists or if the lists contain uncomparable elements, the function may raise an exception. The function returns a new sorted list and does not modify the original lists. It includes all elements from the input lists in the output, including duplicates if any exist across the input lists.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
