Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists of comparable elements as input, combines them into a single list, sorts the combined list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts three lists, which matches the problem description's requirement of merging three lists.

2. **Combining Lists**: The function combines the input lists using the `+` operator, which is a valid way to concatenate lists in Python. The resulting list contains all elements from the input lists, including duplicates if any exist.

3. **Sorting**: The `sorted()` function is used to sort the combined list in ascending order, which meets the problem description's requirement of returning a sorted list.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns a new sorted list without modifying the original input lists, which aligns with the problem description.

5. **Element Types**: The function handles lists containing integers, floats, or strings by relying on Python's built-in comparison operators. As long as the elements within the combined list can be compared, the function will work correctly, which meets the problem description's requirement.

6. **Assumption of Valid Input**: As per the problem statement, it is assumed that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the function's lack of error checking does not affect its correctness.

In summary, the program correctly implements the function as described in the problem description, making it a correct solution.
