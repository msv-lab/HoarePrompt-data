Correctness: **True**.

The provided function, `func_1`, merges three lists into a single sorted list. Here's why it is correct:

- It correctly concatenates the three input lists using the `+` operator, resulting in a single list containing all elements from the input lists.
- It then uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort this combined list in ascending order.
- This approach works for any input lists, regardless of their lengths or the types of elements they contain (as long as the elements are comparable).
- It handles the case where one or more of the input lists are empty, as the `sorted` function will simply sort the non-empty list(s).
- It also correctly handles lists containing duplicate elements, as the `sorted` function is stable and will maintain the relative order of equal elements.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases, including lists with different lengths, empty lists, and lists containing duplicate or non-comparable elements, it is considered correct. The function meets the problem description's requirements for every potential case, so no counterexample can be found where the program does not work as expected.
