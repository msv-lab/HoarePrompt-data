Correctness: **True**.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that merges three input lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) into a single sorted list. The function uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which sorts the elements of the list in ascending order. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the input lists into a single list.

The code agrees with the problem description and the output hints. The function handles lists containing integers, floats, or strings, and it does not distinguish between these types as long as the elements within the combined list can be compared. The function returns a new sorted list and does not modify the original lists.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a list or contains uncomparable elements. The function will work correctly for all valid inputs, and it will include all elements from the input lists in the output, including duplicates if any exist across the input lists.

The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, and they do not reveal any potential issues with the code. Therefore, we can conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
