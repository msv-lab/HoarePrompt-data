The code combines list1, list2, and list3 into one list and sorts it. 
Since list1, list2, and list3 are lists of elements that can be compared, such as integers, floats, or strings, the sorted list will be in ascending order.
The program returns this sorted combined list.
Output State: **The program returns a sorted list containing all elements from list1, list2, and list3 in ascending order**
