#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of elements that can be compared, and all elements are of the same data type.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #The program returns a sorted list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in ascending order, where all elements are of the same data type.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) of comparable elements of the same data type, combines them into a single list, sorts the combined list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The function does not modify the original input lists. It handles edge cases where any or all of the input lists may be empty, and it assumes that all elements across the input lists are of the same data type and are comparable. If the input lists contain elements that are not comparable or are of different data types, the function may raise an error during the sorting process. Upon conclusion, the program's state is such that the original input lists remain unchanged, and the function returns a new sorted list containing all elements from the input lists, provided that the elements are comparable and of the same data type.
