To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. 

- `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of elements that can be compared, with all elements being of the same data type.
- `combined_list` is equal to `list1 + list2 + list3`, which means it contains all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.
- `sorted_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in ascending order.

The code snippet provided is `return sorted_list`. This means the program will return the `sorted_list`, which includes all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, sorted in ascending order.

Given this information, the output state can be determined as follows:

Output State: **The program returns a sorted list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in ascending order, where all elements are of the same data type.**
