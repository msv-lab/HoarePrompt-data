The code `sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)` sorts the elements of `combined_list` in ascending order and assigns the result to `sorted_list`. The value of `combined_list` is equal to `list1 + list2 + list3`, which means it contains all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. 

Since `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of elements that can be compared and are of the same data type, the sorting operation is valid. 

Output State: **`list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of elements that can be compared, all elements are of the same data type; `combined_list` is equal to `list1 + list2 + list3`; `sorted_list` is a sorted list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in ascending order.**
