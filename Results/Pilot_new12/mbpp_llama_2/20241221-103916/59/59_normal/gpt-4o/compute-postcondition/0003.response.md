The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. These parameters are lists that contain elements of the same data type, allowing for comparison. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list that combines all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in ascending order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of comparable elements of the same data type and return a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts three lists of comparable elements of the same data type and returns a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order.**
