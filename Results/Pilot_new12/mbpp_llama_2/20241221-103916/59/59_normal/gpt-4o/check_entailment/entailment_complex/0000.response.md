Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Accepts three lists**: The function `func_1` accepts three lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) as input.
2. **Combines the lists**: The function combines the three input lists into a single list `combined_list` using the `+` operator.
3. **Sorts the combined list**: The function sorts the combined list in ascending order using the built-in `sorted` function and assigns it to `sorted_list`.
4. **Returns the sorted list**: The function returns the sorted list `sorted_list`.
5. **Does not modify the original input lists**: Since the function uses the `+` operator to combine the lists and the `sorted` function to sort the combined list, it does not modify the original input lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`.
6. **Handles edge cases**: The function handles edge cases where any or all of the input lists may be empty, since the `+` operator can handle empty lists and the `sorted` function can handle empty lists as well.
7. **Assumes comparable elements of the same data type**: The function assumes that all elements across the input lists are of the same data type and are comparable, which is a valid assumption according to the problem description.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description, and therefore, it is correct.
