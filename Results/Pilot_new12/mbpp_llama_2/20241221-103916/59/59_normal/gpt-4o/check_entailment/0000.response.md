Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to merge three lists into a single sorted list. It does this by first combining the three input lists into one using the `+` operator, and then sorting the combined list using the built-in `sorted` function.

This approach ensures that the output list is always sorted in ascending order, regardless of the order of elements in the input lists. The function handles duplicate elements correctly, as demonstrated in the provided unit tests, where duplicate values from different lists are properly sorted and placed next to each other in the output list.

Moreover, the function should work correctly for a wide range of inputs, including:

- Lists with negative numbers
- Lists with floating-point numbers
- Empty lists
- Lists with a single element

In all these cases, the function will correctly merge the lists and return a sorted output. Since we cannot find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the description, we conclude that the program is correct.
