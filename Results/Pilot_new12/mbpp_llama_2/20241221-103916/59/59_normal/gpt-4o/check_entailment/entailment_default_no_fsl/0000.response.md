Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a Python function named `func_1` that takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) as input and returns a new sorted list containing all elements from the input lists. The function first combines the input lists into a single list `combined_list` using the `+` operator and then sorts the combined list using the built-in `sorted()` function. The sorted list is then returned by the function.

The problem description asks for a function that merges three lists into a single sorted list. The provided code correctly implements this functionality. The code handles edge cases where any or all of the input lists may be empty because the `+` operator can concatenate empty lists, and the `sorted()` function can sort an empty list.

The code does not modify the original input lists because it creates a new list `combined_list` and sorts a copy of it using the `sorted()` function, which returns a new sorted list.

The code assumes that all elements across the input lists are of the same data type and are comparable, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description. If the input lists contain elements that are not comparable or are of different data types, the `sorted()` function may raise an error, as mentioned in the output hints. However, this is not a correctness issue because the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases.

The provided examples demonstrate that the code works correctly for different input scenarios. Therefore, the code is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
