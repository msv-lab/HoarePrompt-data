Correctness: **True**

The code provided for the `func_1` function merges three input lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) into a single list, sorts the combined list in ascending order, and returns the sorted list. The function correctly handles edge cases where any or all of the input lists may be empty and assumes that all elements across the input lists are of the same data type and are comparable. 

The function operates as follows:

1. It combines `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` into a single list `combined_list` using the `+` operator, which concatenates the lists.
2. It sorts the `combined_list` in ascending order using the `sorted()` function and assigns the result to `sorted_list`.
3. It returns `sorted_list`, which contains all elements from the input lists, sorted in ascending order.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code accurately implements the required functionality. The use of the `sorted()` function ensures that the combined list is sorted correctly, and the function handles the merging of lists and sorting without modifying the original input lists. 

Since we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., the input lists are of the same data type and contain comparable elements), the function will work correctly for all potential cases as per the problem description. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios.
