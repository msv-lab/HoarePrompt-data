Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The problem asks for a function that merges three lists into a single sorted list. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly that.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function takes three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) as input.
2. It combines these lists into a single list (`combined_list`) using the `+` operator, which concatenates the lists.
3. The `sorted()` function is then applied to the `combined_list` to sort its elements in ascending order.
4. The sorted list is returned as the result.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Lists with duplicate elements: The `sorted()` function will place duplicate elements next to each other in the sorted list.
* Lists with elements of the same data type: The program assumes that all elements are of the same data type, which is a valid assumption according to the problem description.
* Lists with different lengths: The `+` operator can handle lists of different lengths, and the `sorted()` function will sort the combined list correctly.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the program works correctly for various input cases. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
