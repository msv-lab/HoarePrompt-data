Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it successfully merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list using the `+` operator, and then sorts the combined list using the built-in `sorted()` function in Python.

The `sorted()` function in Python uses the Timsort algorithm, which has a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n) and is suitable for sorting lists of varying sizes. The function also handles duplicate elements correctly, as demonstrated in the provided unit tests.

I have analyzed the code and could not find any potential case where the program does not follow the problem description. The code handles lists of different lengths, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with varying ranges of numbers. The unit tests provided also cover various scenarios, and the function produces the expected output in all cases.

Therefore, based on the provided code and unit tests, I conclude that the program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
