Correctness: **True**

The program appears to be correct because it seems to be implementing the property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients in the expansion of (1 + 1)^n is equal to 2^(n-1). 

This property can be understood by considering the binomial expansion of (1 + 1)^n. When expanding this expression, each term can be represented as a binomial coefficient multiplied by 1 raised to a certain power and 1 raised to another power. For even index binomial coefficients, we add these coefficients together. 

The formula 2^(n-1) correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients in the binomial expansion of (1 + 1)^n. 

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(4) == 8`, `assert func_1(6) == 32`, and `assert func_1(2) == 2`, demonstrate this property and validate the correctness of the function.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the given unit tests, the program seems to be correct. It always does what the problem description says, which is to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients given a positive integer `n`.
