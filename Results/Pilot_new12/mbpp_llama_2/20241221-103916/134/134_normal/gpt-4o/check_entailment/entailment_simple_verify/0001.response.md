The original assessment is that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer `n`. The assessment is based on the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients in the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` is indeed `2^(n-1)`.

Looking at the annotated version of the code, we see that the function `func_1(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns `2 ** (n - 1)`. This aligns with the mathematical property mentioned earlier. The annotations also confirm that the input `n` is a positive integer, which is in line with the problem description.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(4) == 8`, `assert func_1(6) == 32`, and `assert func_1(2) == 2`, further validate the correctness of the function.

Given the mathematical property, the alignment of the code with this property, and the validation through unit tests, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment is incorrect. The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment by providing a clear understanding of the program's behavior.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
