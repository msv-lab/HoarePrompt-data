Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The function simply returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is a mathematical property where the sum of even index binomial coefficients in a binomial expansion is equal to `2^(n-1)`.

This property can be understood by considering the binomial expansion of `(1 + 1)^n`, which is `2^n`. When we expand this, the coefficients of the even powers of 1 are the even index binomial coefficients, and the coefficients of the odd powers of 1 are the odd index binomial coefficients. Since `(1 + (-1))^n` equals 0 for any positive `n`, the sum of the even index coefficients must be equal to the sum of the odd index coefficients. Therefore, the sum of the even index binomial coefficients is `2^(n-1)`.

The provided unit tests also support this property, as `func_1(4)` returns `8`, `func_1(6)` returns `32`, and `func_1(2)` returns `2`, which are all correct according to the mathematical property. After analyzing the code and considering potential cases, it appears that the function works correctly for all positive integers `n`.
