Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer `n`. The function uses the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients in the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` is `2^(n-1)`. 

This property can be derived from the binomial theorem, which states that `(a + b)^n = ∑(k=0 to n) (n choose k) * a^(n-k) * b^k`. When `a = 1` and `b = 1`, the expansion becomes `2^n = ∑(k=0 to n) (n choose k)`. The even index binomial coefficients are those where `k` is even.

Using the properties of binomial coefficients and the fact that `(1 + x)^n` and `(1 - x)^n` have the same coefficients for even powers of `x`, but opposite coefficients for odd powers of `x`, we can derive that the sum of even index binomial coefficients is `2^(n-1)`.

The provided function `func_1(n)` directly calculates this sum using the formula `2 ** (n - 1)`, which matches the mathematical property. Therefore, the function is correct and works as expected for all positive integer inputs `n`. 

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(4) == 8`, `assert func_1(6) == 32`, and `assert func_1(2) == 2`, also validate the correctness of the function. Since no counterexample can be found, the program is correct.
