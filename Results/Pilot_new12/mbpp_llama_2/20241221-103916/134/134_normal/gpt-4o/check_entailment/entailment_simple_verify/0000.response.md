The original assessment is based on the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients in a binomial expansion is equal to `2^(n-1)`. This property is correctly applied in the provided function `func_1(n)`.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function takes a positive integer `n` as input and returns `2` raised to the power of `n-1`, which aligns with the mathematical property.

Upon reviewing the annotations and the original assessment, it's clear that the original assessment is accurate. The function correctly implements the mathematical property, and the provided unit tests support this property.

The assumption that the input will be a valid positive integer is reasonable, as it's stated in the problem description that the function should take a positive integer `n` as input. Therefore, it's not necessary to handle invalid inputs in this case.

Based on the evidence from the annotations and the original assessment, the program's correctness is confirmed.

Final: **True**
