Correctness: **True**.

The code provided calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n. The function uses the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients of the nth row in Pascal's triangle is 2^(n-1). This property can be proven using the Binomial Theorem and the fact that the sum of all binomial coefficients of the nth row is 2^n.

The code implements this property by simply returning 2 raised to the power of n-1, which is a direct calculation of the desired sum. The provided unit tests also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns the result of 2 raised to the power of n-1, which is consistent with the mathematical property being implemented. Since we assume that the input will be a valid positive integer, the function will always return the correct result.

Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
