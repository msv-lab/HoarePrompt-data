To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code provided.

The problem description asks for a Python function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer n.

The original assessment concludes that the provided function `func_1(n)` is correct, citing the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients in the expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` is indeed `2^(n-1)`. This property is derived from the binomial theorem and the behavior of binomial coefficients when expanding `(1 + x)^n` and `(1 - x)^n`. The function directly implements this property using the formula `2 ** (n - 1)`.

The annotated version of the code describes the state of the program at different points. Before the function call, `n` is a positive integer. The function returns `2` raised to the power of `n-1`, which matches the mathematical property mentioned. The annotated code also notes that the function does not perform error checking for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, but since we assume the input will always be valid (a positive integer), this does not affect the correctness assessment.

Given the mathematical property and its implementation in the function, the original assessment's conclusion that the function is correct appears to be accurate. The function directly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients using a formula that is mathematically sound, as explained in the original assessment. The unit tests provided further support the correctness of the function by validating its output for different inputs.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the program is correct as it accurately implements the required functionality based on a valid mathematical property.

Final: **True**
