Correctness: **True**

The problem description asks to write a Python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. However, it's known that the sum of even index binomial coefficients of the nth row in Pascal's triangle is equal to 2^(n-1). The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates this sum by returning 2 raised to the power of `n-1`. The unit tests provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different values of n. 

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we don't need to worry about cases where the input is not a positive integer. The function will correctly calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients for all valid inputs. 

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements.
