Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements of the given problem description. The problem description asks for a function that takes in a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The function `func_1(n)` returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, which is equivalent to the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

This can be explained by the following mathematical concept: 
For any positive integer `n`, the sum of the binomial coefficients of the form `nCk` where `k` is even is equal to `2 ** (n - 1)`. This is because the binomial expansion of `(1 + 1)^n` and `(1 - 1)^n` can be used to derive this result.

Since `func_1(n)` returns `2 ** (n - 1)`, it correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and always returns the correct result for every potential case.

The unit tests provided, `assert func_1(4) == 8`, `assert func_1(6) == 32`, and `assert func_1(2) == 2`, also demonstrate the correctness of the function. All these tests pass because the function correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for the given inputs. 

Therefore, the program is correct and does what the problem description asks for every potential case.
