#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of `n-1`, where `n` is a positive integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the result of 2 raised to the power of `n-1`. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, so it will return incorrect results or throw an error for these cases. The function's return value is deterministic and does not modify the input variable `n`. After the function concludes, the program's state is updated with the returned value, which is the calculated power of 2.
