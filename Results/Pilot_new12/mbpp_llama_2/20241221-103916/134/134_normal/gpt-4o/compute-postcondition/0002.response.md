Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the result of 2 raised to the power of `n-1`. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, so it will return incorrect results or throw an error for these cases. The function's return value is deterministic and does not modify the input variable `n`. After the function concludes, the program's state is updated with the returned value, which is the calculated power of 2.**
