The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer, and returns the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`. The function performs this calculation by iterating over all integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive), checks if each integer `i` is even, and if so, adds `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum. The function handles all non-negative integers `n` and returns the calculated sum. Note that the function does not validate if `n` is indeed a non-negative integer, so it assumes the input is valid. The function does not modify the input `n` and only returns the calculated sum, leaving the original input unchanged. The result of the function is determined solely by the input `n` and the defined mathematical operations within the function.
