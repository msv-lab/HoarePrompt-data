#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `sum` is the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`, and `i` is `n`.
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even i from 0 to n, where n is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer, and returns the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`. The function performs this calculation by iterating over all integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive), checks if each integer `i` is even, and if so, adds `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum. The function handles all non-negative integers `n` and returns the calculated sum. Note that the function does not validate if `n` is indeed a non-negative integer, so it assumes the input is valid. The function does not modify the input `n` and only returns the calculated sum, leaving the original input unchanged. The result of the function is determined solely by the input `n` and the defined mathematical operations within the function.
