Correctness: **True**

The code provided calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The function `func_1(n)` correctly implements this by iterating over all integers from 0 to `n` (inclusive), checking if each integer `i` is even, and if so, adding `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function handles all non-negative integers `n` and returns the calculated sum without modifying the input `n`. The function assumes that the input `n` is valid, i.e., a non-negative integer.

The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. It does not contain any apparent errors or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results.

The function uses the `math.comb(n, i)` function to calculate the binomial coefficients, which is the correct way to calculate them. It also checks if `i` is even using the condition `i % 2 == 0`, which is the correct way to check for even numbers.

Overall, the code provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description, and therefore, I conclude that the correctness is **True**.
