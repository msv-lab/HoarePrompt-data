The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

Upon reviewing the problem description, the code, and the output hints, it appears that the original assessment is mostly accurate but with a slight discrepancy. The original assessment states that the function accepts a "positive integer n," but the output hints mention that the function accepts a "non-negative integer" and handles this case correctly.

The Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients by iterating over all possible binomial coefficients for `n` (from 0 to `n`), checking if the current index `i` is even, and adding the corresponding binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.

The output hints support the correctness of the function, noting that it handles all non-negative integers `n` and returns the calculated sum without modifying the input `n`. The result of the function is determined solely by the input `n` and the defined mathematical operations within the function.

However, it's worth noting that the original problem description specifies that `n` should be a "positive integer," whereas the function and output hints indicate that `n` can be any non-negative integer, including 0.

Considering this minor discrepancy, if we assume that the input will always be a valid non-negative integer (as per the output hints), the function is indeed correct. But if we strictly adhere to the original problem description requiring a "positive integer," the function might be considered incorrect because it also handles the case when `n` is 0.

Given that the output hints clarify the function's behavior for non-negative integers and assuming valid input, the function is correct in the context provided.

Final: **True**
