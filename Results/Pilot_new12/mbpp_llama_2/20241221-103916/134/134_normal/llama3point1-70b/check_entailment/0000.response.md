Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

The function uses the `math.comb(n, i)` function to calculate the binomial coefficient of `n` choose `i`. It then checks if the index `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. If the index is even, it adds the binomial coefficient to the sum.

This function works correctly for all positive integers `n` because it correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The loop iterates over all possible indices `i` from 0 to `n`, and the `math.comb(n, i)` function correctly calculates the binomial coefficient for each index.

There are no edge cases where the function does not work as expected. The function handles the cases where `n` is 0, 1, or any larger positive integer correctly. 

For example, when `n` is 5, the function correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients as follows:
- `math.comb(5, 0)` = 1 (even index)
- `math.comb(5, 2)` = 10 (even index)
- `math.comb(5, 4)` = 5 (even index)

The sum of these coefficients is 1 + 10 + 5 = 16, which is the correct result.

Therefore, the function `func_1(n)` is correct and works as expected for all positive integers `n`.
