To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to understand what the problem description requires and compare it with what the program actually does.

The problem description asks for a function that takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` does the following:

1. Initializes a variable `sum` to 0.
2. Loops through all indices `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive).
3. For each `i`, checks if `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`).
4. If `i` is even, adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the `sum`.
5. Returns the `sum` after looping through all indices.

This program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for several reasons:

- It iterates over all indices `i` from 0 to `n`, covering all possible positions where binomial coefficients could be calculated.
- It checks each index to see if it's even, which aligns with the problem's requirement to only consider even indices.
- It calculates the binomial coefficient for each even index `i` using `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the sum, which directly addresses the need to sum these coefficients.
- It handles the input as specified (assuming it's a positive integer) and doesn't include error handling for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, as per the problem statement's assumptions about input validity.

However, the problem description specifies that `n` is a positive integer, but the function will also work correctly for `n = 0` because `math.comb(0, 0)` is defined and equals 1, and there are no other indices to consider in that case. This does not contradict the problem description since the function still correctly handles all positive integers as required.

Given these considerations, the program does exactly what the problem description asks for every potential case under the assumption that the input will always be a positive integer.

Correctness: **True**
