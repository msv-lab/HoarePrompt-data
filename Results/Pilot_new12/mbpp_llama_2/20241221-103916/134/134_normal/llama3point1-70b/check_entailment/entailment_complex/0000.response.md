Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that takes a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The function `func_1` does exactly this:

1. It initializes a variable `sum` to 0, which will be used to store the sum of the binomial coefficients.
2. It iterates over all integers `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the `sum`.
4. After the loop finishes, it returns the calculated `sum`, which is the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices.

The function assumes that the input `n` is a valid positive integer, as stated in the problem description. Since we assume that the input will always be valid, we do not need to consider cases where `n` is negative, zero, or not an integer.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, and it correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for any given positive integer `n`.
