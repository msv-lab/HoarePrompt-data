Based on the provided problem description, code, original assessment, and output hints, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

The problem description asks for a function that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The provided code, `func_1(n)`, accurately implements this functionality. It iterates over all possible indices `i` from 0 to `n`, checks if the index `i` is even, and if so, adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.

The original assessment correctly notes that the function works correctly for all positive integers `n` because it correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The assessment also mentions that there are no edge cases where the function does not work as expected.

The output hints provided further support the correctness of the program. They accurately describe the function's behavior, stating that it accepts a parameter `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer, and returns the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`. The hints also note that the function assumes the input is valid, which is a reasonable assumption given the problem description.

One potential issue is that the problem description specifically asks for a positive integer `n`, while the output hints and the code itself allow for non-negative integers (including 0). However, the code still produces the correct result for `n = 0`, which is `math.comb(0, 0) = 1`. Therefore, this does not affect the overall correctness of the program.

In conclusion, based on the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, I believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
