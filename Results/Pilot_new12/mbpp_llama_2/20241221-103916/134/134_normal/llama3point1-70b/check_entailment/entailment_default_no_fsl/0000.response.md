Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the problem description states that the input `n` should be a positive integer, but the provided code and output hints indicate that the function can handle non-negative integers (i.e., including 0). This means that the code does not correctly implement the problem description's constraint on the input being a positive integer.

For example, if `n = 0`, the function will return `1`, which is mathematically correct but does not align with the problem description's requirement that `n` be a positive integer. Similarly, if `n` is a negative integer, the function will raise an error, which again does not align with the problem description's requirement.

To fix this, the code should include input validation to ensure that `n` is a positive integer before performing the calculation. Without such validation, the code does not accurately implement the problem description, and its correctness is limited to non-negative integer inputs. 

This program works correctly for all the positive integer cases but it still does not follow the problem description because it can handle cases that are not described in the problem description like non-negative integers.
