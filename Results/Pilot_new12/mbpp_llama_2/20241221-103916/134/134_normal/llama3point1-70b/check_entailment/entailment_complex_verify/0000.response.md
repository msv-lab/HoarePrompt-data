Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, I will assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires a function that takes a positive integer `n` and returns the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

The original assessment claims that the function `func_1(n)` is correct and works as expected for all positive integers `n`. The assessment provides a clear explanation of how the function calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients and handles different cases.

The annotated version of the code confirms the original assessment. It describes the state of the program before and after the function call, which is consistent with the expected behavior. The annotations also highlight that the function assumes the input `n` is a non-negative integer and does not perform any validation.

However, the problem description specifically mentions that the input `n` is a positive integer, whereas the annotated version and the original assessment mention that `n` is a non-negative integer. This discrepancy could potentially lead to a false result if `n` is 0, since the sum of even index binomial coefficients for `n=0` is 1, which is a valid result.

Despite this minor discrepancy, the function still produces the correct result for all positive integers `n`. The function does not handle the case where `n` is negative, but this is not a requirement according to the problem description.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct, with the understanding that the input `n` is indeed a positive integer as specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
