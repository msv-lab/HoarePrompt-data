Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` appears to correctly calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

Here is why:
- It iterates over all possible binomial coefficients for `n` (from 0 to `n`) using a for loop.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.
- The function `math.comb(n, i)` correctly calculates the binomial coefficient for the given `n` and `i`.
- The function returns the sum of the even index binomial coefficients.

This implementation aligns with the problem description and should work correctly for all positive integer inputs `n`. 

No potential case has been found where the program does not work as expected, and the provided code seems to handle all edge cases correctly. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
