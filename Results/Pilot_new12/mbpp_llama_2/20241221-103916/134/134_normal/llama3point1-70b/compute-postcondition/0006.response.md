To calculate the result, we first need to understand what `math.comb(n, i)` does. This function calculates the number of ways to choose `i` items from `n` items without repetition and without order, which is equivalent to the binomial coefficient "n choose i", calculated as `n! / (i! * (n-i)!)`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, and `i` is 1, `math.comb(n, i)` simplifies to `n! / (1! * (n-1)!)`, which further simplifies to `n`. 

Thus, `sum += math.comb(n, i)` is equivalent to `sum += n`. 

Since the initial state specifies that there is no change in `sum`, and `n` is a positive integer, after the operation, `sum` will be increased by the value of `n`.

The states of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 1, `sum` is increased by `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 1, `sum` is equal to its original value plus `n`**
