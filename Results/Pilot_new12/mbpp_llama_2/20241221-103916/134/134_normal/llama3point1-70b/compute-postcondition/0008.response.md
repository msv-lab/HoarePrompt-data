According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. Since `i` is now 2, the condition `i % 2 == 0` is true. However, the value of `sum` is not relevant to the loop condition. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n + 1`, so `n` must be at least 2 for `i` to be 2, but since `n` is already at least 1 and `i` is 2, `n` can be 1 and `i` is the last iteration or `n` is greater than 1 for more iterations, but to execute one more time `n` must be at least 2 for `i` to be less than `n+1` when `i` is 2.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `i` is 2**
