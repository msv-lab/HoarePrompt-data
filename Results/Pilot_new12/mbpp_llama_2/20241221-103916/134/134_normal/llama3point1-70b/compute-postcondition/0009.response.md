To calculate the output state, we need to consider the initial state and the given Python code snippet. The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `i` is 2. The code snippet is: `sum += math.comb(n, i)`. 

The `math.comb(n, i)` function calculates the number of ways to choose `i` items from `n` items without repetition and without order. This is equivalent to calculating the binomial coefficient `n! / (i! * (n-i)!)`. 

Given `i` is 2, we are calculating the sum of combinations of `n` items taken 2 at a time.

However, the initial state does not specify the value of `sum` before the code execution. Therefore, we can only express the change in `sum` relative to its original value.

So, `sum` is increased by `math.comb(n, 2)`, which is `n! / (2! * (n-2)!)` = `(n * (n-1)) / 2`. The states of the other variables (`n` and `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `i` is 2, `sum` is increased by `n * (n-1) / 2`**
