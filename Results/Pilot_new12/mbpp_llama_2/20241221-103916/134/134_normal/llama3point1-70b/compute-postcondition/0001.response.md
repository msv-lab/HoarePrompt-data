According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, the loop will definitely execute. The loop will iterate from `0` to `n` (inclusive), so `i` will start from `0`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
