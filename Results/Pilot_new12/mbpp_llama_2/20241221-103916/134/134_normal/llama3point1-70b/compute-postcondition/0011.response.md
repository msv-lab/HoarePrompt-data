To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(n + 1):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        sum += math.comb(n, i)
```
This loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n` (inclusive), and for each even `i`, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the `sum`.

Let's consider the possible values of `i` and their corresponding effects on the `sum`:

* When `i` is 0, `math.comb(n, 0)` is always 1, so `sum` becomes 1.
* When `i` is even and greater than 0, `math.comb(n, i)` is added to `sum`.
* When `i` is odd, the `if` condition is not met, and `sum` remains unchanged.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `sum` will contain the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`.

The `i` variable will have the value `n`, since it is the last value in the range.

The `n` variable remains unchanged throughout the loop, so its original value is preserved.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 0), the `sum` will remain 0, since the loop will not iterate at all.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `sum` is the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`, and `i` is `n`.**
