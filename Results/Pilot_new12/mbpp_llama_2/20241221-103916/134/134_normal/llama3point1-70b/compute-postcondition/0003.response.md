The code `sum += math.comb(n, i)` calculates the combination of `n` and `i` using the `math.comb` function and adds it to the current value of `sum`. 

Since `i` is 0 and `n` is a positive integer, `math.comb(n, i)` is equal to `math.comb(n, 0)`, which is 1 because there is only one way to choose zero items from a set of `n` items. 

Therefore, the value of `sum` becomes `sum + 1`, which is `0 + 1`, resulting in `sum` being 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 0**
