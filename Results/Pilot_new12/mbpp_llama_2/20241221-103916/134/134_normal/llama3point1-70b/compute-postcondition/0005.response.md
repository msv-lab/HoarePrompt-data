According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `n + 1`, which means `n` must be at least 1 for `i` to be 1 and still execute the loop. Since `i` is now 1 (an odd number), according to the given information, there is no change in `sum` as the condition only updates `sum` when `i` is even.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `i` is 1, there is no change in `sum`**
