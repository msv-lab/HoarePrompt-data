#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `s` is a string, and 'z' is not present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the character 'z' is present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters. The function will return `True` if 'z' is found in this substring and `False` otherwise. The input string `s` is not modified by the function. The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings and strings with less than 3 characters, in which case it will return `False` because there are no characters to check between the first and last characters. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so if a non-string input is provided, the function may throw an error when trying to access the string's characters.
