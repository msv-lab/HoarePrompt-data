Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` checks if the string `s` contains the character 'z' at any position except the start and end of the string. The function uses Python's string slicing feature (`s[1:-1]`) to exclude the first and last characters of the string and then checks if 'z' is present in the resulting substring using the `in` operator.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function takes a string `s` as input.
2. It uses `s[1:-1]` to create a substring that excludes the first and last characters of `s`.
3. It checks if 'z' is present in this substring using the `in` operator.
4. If 'z' is found, the function returns `True`, indicating that 'z' is present in the string at a position other than the start or end.
5. If 'z' is not found, the function returns `False`, indicating that 'z' is either not present in the string or is present only at the start or end.

The function handles all possible cases correctly:

- If 'z' is present at a position other than the start or end, it returns `True`.
- If 'z' is present only at the start or end, it returns `False`.
- If 'z' is not present in the string, it returns `False`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the function's correctness for different scenarios. Overall, the program accurately implements the behavior described in the problem statement.
