You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True
assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False
assert func_1('  lang  .') == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `s` is a string, and 'z' is not present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether the character 'z' is present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters. The function will return `True` if 'z' is found in this substring and `False` otherwise. The input string `s` is not modified by the function. The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings and strings with less than 3 characters, in which case it will return `False` because there are no characters to check between the first and last characters. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so if a non-string input is provided, the function may throw an error when trying to access the string's characters.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
