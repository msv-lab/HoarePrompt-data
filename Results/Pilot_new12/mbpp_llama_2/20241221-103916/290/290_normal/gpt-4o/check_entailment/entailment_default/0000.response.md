Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code checks if the character 'z' is present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters. The function `func_1` uses Python's string slicing feature to exclude the first and last characters of the string (`s[1:-1]`) and checks if 'z' is present in this substring using the `in` operator. The function handles strings of any length, including empty strings and strings with less than 3 characters, in which case it will return `False` because there are no characters to check between the first and last characters.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function. The function behaves as expected for the test cases:

- 'pythonzabc.' returns `True` because 'z' is present in the substring excluding the first and last characters.
- 'zxyabc.' returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string.
- '  lang .' returns `False` because 'z' is not present in the string.

Given the problem description and the code, it appears that the function correctly implements the required behavior for all potential cases, assuming valid input (i.e., a string).
