Correctness: **True**

The code provided checks if the string 's' contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The function `func_1` uses Python's string slicing feature to exclude the first and last characters of the string (`s[1:-1]`) and checks if 'z' is present in the resulting substring.

The function correctly handles the following cases:

- When 'z' is present somewhere in the middle of the string, it returns `True`.
- When 'z' is present at the start or end of the string, it returns `False`.
- When 'z' is not present at all in the string, it returns `False`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) cover different scenarios, including the presence of 'z' in the middle of the string, at the start of the string, and the absence of 'z' in the string.

Since the code accurately implements the described functionality and handles all potential cases, it can be considered correct.
