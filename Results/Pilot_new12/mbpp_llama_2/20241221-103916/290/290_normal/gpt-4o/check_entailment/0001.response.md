Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word. This is achieved by slicing the string from the second character to the second last character (`s[1:-1]`) and checking if 'z' is present in this slice.

The function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly returns `True` when 'z' is present in the middle of the string, and `False` when 'z' is not present or is present at the start or end of the string. The function also handles strings with multiple words, special characters, and strings with leading or trailing spaces.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the middle of the string, `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string, and `func_1('  lang .')` returns `False` because 'z' is not present in the string.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
