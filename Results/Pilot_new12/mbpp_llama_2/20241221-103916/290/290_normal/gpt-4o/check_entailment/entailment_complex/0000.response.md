Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function that checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The function `func_1` does exactly this by checking if 'z' is present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters using the condition `('z' in s[1:-1])`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Handling 'z' at the start and end**: The program correctly excludes the first and last characters of the string by using `s[1:-1]`. This ensures that 'z' is not counted if it appears at the start or end of the string.
2. **Checking for 'z' in the substring**: The program checks if 'z' is present in the substring using the `in` operator. If 'z' is found, the function returns `True`.
3. **Returning False if 'z' is not found**: If 'z' is not found in the substring, the function returns `False`.

The program handles strings of any length, including empty strings and strings with less than 3 characters, as specified in the annotations. In these cases, the function will return `False` because there are no characters to check between the first and last characters.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality and meets the problem description.
