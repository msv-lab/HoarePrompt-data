Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. It checks if the character 'z' is present in the substring of the input string `s`, excluding the first and last characters. The function handles strings of any length and returns `True` if 'z' is found in the specified substring and `False` otherwise.

The code works correctly for all potential cases, including empty strings and strings with less than 3 characters, in which case it returns `False` because there are no characters to check between the first and last characters. The provided assertions demonstrate the function's correctness for various inputs.

For example, `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the substring excluding the first and last characters. Similarly, `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string, and `func_1('  lang .')` returns `False` because 'z' is not present in the substring.

The output hints consistently describe the function's behavior, and there are no apparent cases where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is considered correct.
