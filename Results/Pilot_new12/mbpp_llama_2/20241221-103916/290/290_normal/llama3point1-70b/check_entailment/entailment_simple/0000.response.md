Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

*   The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and splits it into words using the `split` method.
*   It then iterates over each word in the list of words.
*   For each word, it checks if the word has a length greater than 1 and if the character 'z' is present in the middle characters (i.e., excluding the first and last characters) using the condition `len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]`.
*   If it finds a word that satisfies this condition, it immediately returns `True`.
*   If it iterates over all words and doesn't find any word with 'z' in its middle characters, it returns `False`.

This behavior matches the problem description, which requires the function to check if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The function correctly handles the case where a word may have 'z' at the start or end by checking `word[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters.

The function assumes valid input, as specified in the problem description, so it doesn't need to handle cases like empty strings, non-string inputs, or words with non-character characters. Under the assumption that the input will be valid, the function behaves as expected and correctly checks for 'z' in the middle characters of each word in the input string.
