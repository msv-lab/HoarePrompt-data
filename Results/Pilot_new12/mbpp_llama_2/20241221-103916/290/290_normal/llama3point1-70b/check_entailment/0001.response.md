Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks if a string contains 'z' at any position except at the start and end of the words. The function `func_1(s)` splits the input string `s` into individual words and iterates through each word. It checks if the length of the word is more than one character and if 'z' is present in the word excluding the first and last characters.

This condition ensures that 'z' is not at the start or end of the word, meeting the requirements of the problem description. The function returns `True` as soon as it finds a word with 'z' in the middle and `False` if no such word is found after checking all words.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:

* Empty strings: The function will return `False` for an empty string because there are no words to check.
* Single character words: The function will not consider single character words because of the condition `len(word) > 1`.
* Words with 'z' at the start or end: The function correctly excludes 'z' at the start and end of the words by using `word[1:-1]`.
* Multiple words: The function checks each word individually, ensuring that it correctly handles strings with multiple words.

Given the thoroughness of the function in covering different potential cases and its adherence to the problem description, the program is considered correct.
