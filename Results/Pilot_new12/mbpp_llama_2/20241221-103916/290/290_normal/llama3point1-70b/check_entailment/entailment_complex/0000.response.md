Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks if a string contains 'z' in the middle characters of any word, excluding the start and end of each word. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The function splits the input string into a list of words using the `split()` method.
2. It then iterates over each word in the list. For each word, it checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 and if 'z' is present in the middle characters of the word (i.e., `word[1:-1]`).
3. If 'z' is found in the middle characters of any word, the function immediately returns `True`.
4. If no 'z' is found in the middle characters of any word after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

The program handles edge cases correctly, such as empty strings, single-character words, and words with 'z' at the start or end. The function assumes that the input will always be a string, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality, and it does what the problem description says for every potential case.
