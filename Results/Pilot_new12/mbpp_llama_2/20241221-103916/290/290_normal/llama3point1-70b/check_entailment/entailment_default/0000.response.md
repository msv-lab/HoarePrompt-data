Correctness: **True**

The code appears to correctly follow the problem description, checking if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word. 

The function `func_1` splits the input string into words and checks each word for the presence of 'z' in its middle characters. If a word contains 'z' in its middle characters, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. 

This logic aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to check if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. The code handles edge cases where the input string is empty or contains single-character words, which is also in line with the output hints. 

For example, if the input string is "hello zzz world", the function will return `True` because 'z' is present in the middle of the word "zzz". If the input string is "hello zoo world", the function will also return `True` because 'z' is present in the middle of the word "zoo". If the input string is "hello z world", the function will return `True` because 'z' is present in the middle of the word "z" (even though it's a single-character word). 

In all these cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Since the function handles the potential cases and agrees with the output hints, we can conclude that it is correct.
