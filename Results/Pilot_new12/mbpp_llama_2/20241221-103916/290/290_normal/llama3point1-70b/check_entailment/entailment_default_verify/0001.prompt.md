You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks if a string contains 'z' at any position except at the start and end of the words. The function `func_1(s)` splits the input string `s` into individual words and iterates through each word. It checks if the length of the word is more than one character and if 'z' is present in the word excluding the first and last characters.

This condition ensures that 'z' is not at the start or end of the word, meeting the requirements of the problem description. The function returns `True` as soon as it finds a word with 'z' in the middle and `False` if no such word is found after checking all words.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:

* Empty strings: The function will return `False` for an empty string because there are no words to check.
* Single character words: The function will not consider single character words because of the condition `len(word) > 1`.
* Words with 'z' at the start or end: The function correctly excludes 'z' at the start and end of the words by using `word[1:-1]`.
* Multiple words: The function checks each word individually, ensuring that it correctly handles strings with multiple words.

Given the thoroughness of the function in covering different potential cases and its adherence to the problem description, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input, splits it into a list of words, and checks each word for the presence of 'z' in its middle characters. If any word contains 'z' in its middle characters, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. The original string `s` remains unchanged throughout the process. The function handles edge cases where the input string is empty or contains single-character words, and it correctly identifies the presence of 'z' in multi-character words. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it assumes that the input will always be a string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
