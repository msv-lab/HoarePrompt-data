You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word, by splitting the string into words and iterating over each word. It checks if the word has more than one character and if 'z' is present in any character position except the first and last. If such a word is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The function handles all potential cases correctly:

* It checks each word individually, ensuring that 'z' is not at the start or end of the word.
* It ignores one-character words, as 'z' cannot be in the middle of a one-character word.
* It only returns True when it finds a word that meets the condition, and False otherwise.

Since I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the description, the program is correct. It correctly checks for the presence of 'z' in the middle of words, excluding 'z' at the start and end of words, and handles all edge cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input, splits it into a list of words, and checks each word for the presence of 'z' in its middle characters. If any word contains 'z' in its middle characters, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. The original string `s` remains unchanged throughout the process. The function handles edge cases where the input string is empty or contains single-character words, and it correctly identifies the presence of 'z' in multi-character words. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it assumes that the input will always be a string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
