According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. If the list has at least 1 word, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `s` is a string and `words` is a list of words from string `s`. For the loop to be executed, the list `words` must have at least 1 word and `word` is the first word in the list.

State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of words from string `s` that must have at least 1 word, `word` is the first word in the list**
