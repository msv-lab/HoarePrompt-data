The code splits the string `s` into a list of words using the `split()` method, which splits a string into a list where each word is a list item. The result is assigned to the variable `words`. 

The state of the variable `s` is not affected, so it remains a string. The variable `words` is assigned the value of the list of words from the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of words from string `s`**
