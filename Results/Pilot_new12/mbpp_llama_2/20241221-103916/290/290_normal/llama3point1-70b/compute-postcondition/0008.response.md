According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. If the list has at least 3 words, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `words` has at least 2 words, `word` is the second word in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 words and the `word` is the third word in the list.
State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list of words from string `s` that must have at least 3 words, `word` is the third word in the list**
