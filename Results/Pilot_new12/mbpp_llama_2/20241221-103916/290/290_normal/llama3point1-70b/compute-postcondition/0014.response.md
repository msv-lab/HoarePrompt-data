Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` as input, splits it into a list of words, and checks each word for the presence of 'z' in its middle characters. If any word contains 'z' in its middle characters, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`. The original string `s` remains unchanged throughout the process. The function handles edge cases where the input string is empty or contains single-character words, and it correctly identifies the presence of 'z' in multi-character words. The function does not perform any error checking on the input type, so it assumes that the input will always be a string.**
