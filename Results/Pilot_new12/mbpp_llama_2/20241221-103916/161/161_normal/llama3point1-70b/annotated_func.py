#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `a` is the (n-1)th term of the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth term of the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth term of the Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the following cases: 
- If `n` is 0, it returns 2. 
- If `n` is 1, it returns 1. 
- If `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, it returns the `n`th term of a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1. 
The function does not modify the input variable `n` and only returns a calculated value based on `n`. 
The function handles all non-negative integer inputs, including edge cases where `n` equals 0 or 1, and does not have any known missing logic for the specified input range. 
After the function concludes, its final state is that it has returned one of these calculated values based on the input `n`, with no side effects on external state.
