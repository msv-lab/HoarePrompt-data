The code swaps the values of `a` and `b` and also updates the value of `b` to be the sum of the original `a` and `b`. 

Initially, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4. After the execution of the code, `a` becomes 4 (the original value of `b`) and `b` becomes 3 + 4 = 7.

The states of the other variables (`n` and `_`) are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7, `_` is 4.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7, `_` is 4**
