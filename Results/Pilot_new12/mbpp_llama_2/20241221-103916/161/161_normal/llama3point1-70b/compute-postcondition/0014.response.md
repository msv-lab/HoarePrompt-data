To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. 

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1.
- `a` is the (n-1)th term of the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1.
- `b` is the nth term of the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1.

The Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1 would be: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76,...

Since `a` is the (n-1)th term and `b` is the nth term, and considering the sequence provided, `b` would be the term that comes after `a` in this sequence.

The code returns `b`, which means we are looking for the nth term of this specific Fibonacci-like sequence.

Output State: **The program returns the nth term of the Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.**
