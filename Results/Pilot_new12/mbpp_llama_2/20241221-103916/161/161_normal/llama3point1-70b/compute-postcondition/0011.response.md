According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, which means the loop has already executed for `_` equal to 2 and 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 to include `_` equal to 4 in the range. The values of `a` and `b` do not affect the loop condition.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 4**
