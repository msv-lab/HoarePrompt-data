The code executes the line `a, b = b, a + b`. This means that the value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which is 1, and the value of `b` becomes the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`, which is 2 + 1 = 3. The value of `n` and `_` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 2**
