According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate from 2 to `n` (inclusive), so for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer and not equal to 1, this condition is already met. However, to ensure the loop executes as intended, we need to acknowledge that `_` (a common variable name for a "throwaway" variable) will take on the values from 2 to `n` during each iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `_` is 2**
