The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the value of `n`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return a value based on the following conditions: 
Case_1: returns 2, 
Case_2: returns 1, 
Case_3: returns the nth term of the Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1, for `n` greater than 1.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns either 2, 1, or the nth term of a Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1 for n greater than 1.**
