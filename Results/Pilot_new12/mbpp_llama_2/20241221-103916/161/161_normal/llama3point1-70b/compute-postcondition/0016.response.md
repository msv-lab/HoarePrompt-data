Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the following cases: 
- If `n` is 0, it returns 2. 
- If `n` is 1, it returns 1. 
- If `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, it returns the `n`th term of a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1. 
The function does not modify the input variable `n` and only returns a calculated value based on `n`. 
The function handles all non-negative integer inputs, including edge cases where `n` equals 0 or 1, and does not have any known missing logic for the specified input range. 
After the function concludes, its final state is that it has returned one of these calculated values based on the input `n`, with no side effects on external state.**
