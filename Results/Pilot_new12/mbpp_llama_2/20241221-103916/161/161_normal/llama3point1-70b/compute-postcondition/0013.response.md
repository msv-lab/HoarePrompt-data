To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for _ in range(2, n + 1):
    a, b = b, a + b
```
The loop initializes with `n` as a positive integer and not equal to 1, `a` as 2, and `b` as 1.

From the output states after a few iterations, we observe:

- After 1 iteration, `a` is 1, `b` is 3.
- After 2 iterations, `a` is 3, `b` is 4.
- After 3 iterations, `a` is 4, `b` is 7.

Notice that `a` and `b` seem to be following a pattern where `a` becomes the previous value of `b`, and `b` becomes the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`. This pattern resembles the Fibonacci sequence but starting with different initial values (2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1).

Given the nature of the loop, it will execute from 2 to `n` (inclusive), meaning it will run `n - 1` times because it starts from 2. The values of `a` and `b` after the loop finishes will depend on the number of iterations, which is determined by `n`.

If `n` is 2, the loop executes once, resulting in `a` being 1 and `b` being 3, as observed.

For `n > 2`, `a` and `b` will continue to update according to the Fibonacci-like sequence. The final values of `a` and `b` after the loop will be the `(n-1)`th and `n`th terms of this sequence, respectively, considering the initial terms as `a=2` (first term) and `b=1` (second term) before the loop starts.

Thus, after all iterations, `a` will hold the `(n-1)`th term of this sequence, and `b` will hold the `n`th term.

Given the original values and how the loop updates `a` and `b`, the output state after all iterations can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `a` is the (n-1)th term of the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth term of the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1.**
