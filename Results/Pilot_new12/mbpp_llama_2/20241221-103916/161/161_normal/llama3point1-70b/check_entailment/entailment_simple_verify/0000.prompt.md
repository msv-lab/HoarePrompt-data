You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The implementation provided uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number, which is efficient for large values of n.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Base Cases**: The function correctly handles the base cases when `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1, respectively, as these are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

2. **Iterative Calculation**: For `n > 1`, the function initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1). It then iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), updating `a` and `b` in each iteration to hold the last two calculated Lucas numbers. This is done using the recurrence relation of the Lucas sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

3. **Return Value**: After the loop finishes, `b` holds the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned by the function.

Considering various potential cases:

- **Small Values of n**: The function correctly returns the first few Lucas numbers (2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11,...) for small values of `n`.
- **Large Values of n**: The iterative approach ensures that the function can handle large values of `n` without running into recursion depth issues or significant performance degradation.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge case where `n` is 0 or 1 correctly, returning 2 and 1, respectively.

Given the implementation and the analysis above, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases. It correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number according to the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `a` is the (n-1)th term of the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth term of the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth term of the Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1, where n is a positive integer greater than 1.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
