You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The implementation provided uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number, which is efficient for large values of n.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Base Cases**: The function correctly handles the base cases when `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1, respectively, as these are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

2. **Iterative Calculation**: For `n > 1`, the function initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1). It then iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), updating `a` and `b` in each iteration to hold the last two calculated Lucas numbers. This is done using the recurrence relation of the Lucas sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

3. **Return Value**: After the loop finishes, `b` holds the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned by the function.

Considering various potential cases:

- **Small Values of n**: The function correctly returns the first few Lucas numbers (2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11,...) for small values of `n`.
- **Large Values of n**: The iterative approach ensures that the function can handle large values of `n` without running into recursion depth issues or significant performance degradation.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge case where `n` is 0 or 1 correctly, returning 2 and 1, respectively.

Given the implementation and the analysis above, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases. It correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number according to the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the following cases: 
- If `n` is 0, it returns 2. 
- If `n` is 1, it returns 1. 
- If `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, it returns the `n`th term of a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1. 
The function does not modify the input variable `n` and only returns a calculated value based on `n`. 
The function handles all non-negative integer inputs, including edge cases where `n` equals 0 or 1, and does not have any known missing logic for the specified input range. 
After the function concludes, its final state is that it has returned one of these calculated values based on the input `n`, with no side effects on external state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
