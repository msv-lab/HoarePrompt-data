Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a correct implementation of a function to find the n'th Lucas number. 

The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting values (2 and 1 instead of 1 and 1). The function `func_1(n)` correctly handles the base cases where n is 0 or 1, and then iteratively calculates the n'th Lucas number using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.

The loop starts from 2 and goes up to n (inclusive), and in each iteration, it updates the values of `a` and `b` to the next two numbers in the sequence. Finally, it returns the value of `b`, which is the n'th Lucas number.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles positive integers as input and returns the corresponding Lucas number. 

For example, `func_1(0)` returns 2, `func_1(1)` returns 1, `func_1(2)` returns 3, `func_1(3)` returns 4, and so on, which are the correct values for the Lucas sequence. 

Therefore, the program is correct, and I believe it will work correctly for all positive integer inputs.
