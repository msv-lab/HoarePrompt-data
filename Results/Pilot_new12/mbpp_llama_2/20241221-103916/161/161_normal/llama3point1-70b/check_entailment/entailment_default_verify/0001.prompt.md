You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a correct implementation of a function to find the n'th Lucas number. 

The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting values (2 and 1 instead of 1 and 1). The function `func_1(n)` correctly handles the base cases where n is 0 or 1, and then iteratively calculates the n'th Lucas number using a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.

The loop starts from 2 and goes up to n (inclusive), and in each iteration, it updates the values of `a` and `b` to the next two numbers in the sequence. Finally, it returns the value of `b`, which is the n'th Lucas number.

I have not found any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles positive integers as input and returns the corresponding Lucas number. 

For example, `func_1(0)` returns 2, `func_1(1)` returns 1, `func_1(2)` returns 3, `func_1(3)` returns 4, and so on, which are the correct values for the Lucas sequence. 

Therefore, the program is correct, and I believe it will work correctly for all positive integer inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on the following cases: 
- If `n` is 0, it returns 2. 
- If `n` is 1, it returns 1. 
- If `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, it returns the `n`th term of a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1. 
The function does not modify the input variable `n` and only returns a calculated value based on `n`. 
The function handles all non-negative integer inputs, including edge cases where `n` equals 0 or 1, and does not have any known missing logic for the specified input range. 
After the function concludes, its final state is that it has returned one of these calculated values based on the input `n`, with no side effects on external state.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
