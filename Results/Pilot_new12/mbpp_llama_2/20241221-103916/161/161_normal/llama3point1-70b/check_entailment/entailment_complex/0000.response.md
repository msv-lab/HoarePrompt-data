Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with a different starting point. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, while the Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1. 

The program correctly handles all non-negative integer inputs as follows:

- If `n` is 0, it returns 2, which is the first number in the Lucas sequence.
- If `n` is 1, it returns 1, which is the second number in the Lucas sequence.
- If `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, it calculates the `n`th term of the Lucas sequence using a loop, starting with 2 and 1.

The program does not modify the input variable `n` and only returns a calculated value based on `n`. The function handles all non-negative integer inputs, including edge cases where `n` equals 0 or 1.

The key aspect of the program that meets the problem description is the loop that calculates the `n`th term of the Lucas sequence. This loop uses the previously calculated terms to calculate the next term, just like in the Fibonacci sequence. However, it starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1, as required by the Lucas sequence.

Overall, the program correctly calculates the `n`th Lucas number for any non-negative integer `n`, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.
