Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The implementation provided uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number, which is efficient for large values of n.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Base Cases**: The function correctly handles the base cases when `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1, respectively, as these are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

2. **Iterative Calculation**: For `n > 1`, the function initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1). It then iterates from 2 to `n` (inclusive), updating `a` and `b` in each iteration to hold the last two calculated Lucas numbers. This is done using the recurrence relation of the Lucas sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

3. **Return Value**: After the loop finishes, `b` holds the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned by the function.

Considering various potential cases:

- **Small Values of n**: The function correctly returns the first few Lucas numbers (2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11,...) for small values of `n`.
- **Large Values of n**: The iterative approach ensures that the function can handle large values of `n` without running into recursion depth issues or significant performance degradation.
- **Edge Cases**: The function handles the edge case where `n` is 0 or 1 correctly, returning 2 and 1, respectively.

Given the implementation and the analysis above, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases. It correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number according to the provided problem description.
