Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate. Here's why:

1. **Problem Description Matching**: The program is designed to find the n'th Lucas number, which is a sequence similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The provided code implements this correctly, initializing the sequence with 2 and 1 and calculating subsequent numbers as the sum of the previous two.

2. **Correct Base Cases**: The program correctly handles the base cases for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, returning 2 and 1, respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

3. **Iterative Calculation Logic**: The iterative approach used in the program to calculate the n'th Lucas number for `n > 1` is sound. It updates the variables `a` and `b` in each iteration to hold the last two calculated Lucas numbers, using the recurrence relation of the Lucas sequence.

4. **Output Hints Alignment**: The output hints provided align with the program's functionality. They describe the program's behavior for different values of `n`, including edge cases (`n = 0` or `n = 1`) and positive integers greater than 1, which matches the program's implementation.

5. **Assumption of Valid Input**: Since we assume the input will always be a non-negative integer and the program handles this input range correctly without any known missing logic, the program's correctness is further supported.

Given this analysis, the original assessment that the program is correct is justified. The program accurately implements the logic for finding the n'th Lucas number, handles edge cases properly, and aligns with the provided output hints.

Final: **True**
