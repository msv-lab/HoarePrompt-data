Correctness: **True**

The code provided implements a function to find the n'th Lucas number, which is a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1. The function correctly handles the base cases where n is 0 or 1, and it uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number for n greater than 1.

The function uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach, where it initializes the first two numbers in the sequence (a and b) and then iteratively updates them to calculate the next number in the sequence. This approach ensures that the function has a time complexity of O(n) and a space complexity of O(1), making it efficient for large inputs.

The output hints provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for different values of n, and there are no known missing logic or edge cases that the function does not handle. The function also does not modify the input variable n and only returns a calculated value based on n, which is in line with the problem description.

Overall, the code provided correctly implements the function to find the n'th Lucas number, and it handles all non-negative integer inputs as required by the problem description.
