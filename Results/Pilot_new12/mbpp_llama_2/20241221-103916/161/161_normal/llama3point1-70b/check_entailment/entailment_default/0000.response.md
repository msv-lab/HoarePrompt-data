Correctness: **True**

The code appears to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1(n)` calculates the `n`th Lucas number, which is a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1. 

The function correctly handles the base cases when `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For `n` greater than 1, it calculates the `n`th term of the sequence using a loop that iteratively updates the values of `a` and `b` to the next two numbers in the sequence.

The output hints agree with the code and confirm that it handles all non-negative integer inputs correctly, including edge cases where `n` equals 0 or 1. The function does not have any known missing logic for the specified input range, and its final state is that it has returned one of the calculated values based on the input `n`, with no side effects on external state.

Since the Lucas sequence is defined as: 
L(0) = 2, 
L(1) = 1, 
L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1,
the function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the `n`th Lucas number for all non-negative integer inputs.
