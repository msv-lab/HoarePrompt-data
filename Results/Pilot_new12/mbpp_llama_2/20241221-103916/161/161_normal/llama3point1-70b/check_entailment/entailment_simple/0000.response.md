Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The function correctly implements this sequence.

Here's a breakdown of why the function meets the problem description:

1. **Base Cases**: The function correctly handles the base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1`, returning 2 and 1, respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.

2. **Recursive Formula**: For `n > 1`, the function uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number. It initializes `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1) and then iteratively updates `a` and `b` using the formula `a, b = b, a + b`. This formula is equivalent to the recursive definition of the Lucas sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms.

3. **Return Value**: After the loop finishes, `b` holds the n'th Lucas number, which the function then returns.

Given that the input `n` is a non-negative integer, the function will always return the correct n'th Lucas number, as per the problem description. The function's logic directly implements the definition of the Lucas sequence, ensuring that it produces the correct output for every valid input.
