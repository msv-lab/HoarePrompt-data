According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (inclusive). If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, `n` is greater than 1 and `_` is 3. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 4, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 4.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 4**
