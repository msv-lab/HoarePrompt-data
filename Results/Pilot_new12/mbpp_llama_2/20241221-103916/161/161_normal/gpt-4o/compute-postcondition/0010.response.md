The code simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3. After executing the code, `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which is 3, and `b` becomes the sum of the old `a` and the old `b`, which is 1 + 3 = 4.

The state of `n` and `_` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 3**
