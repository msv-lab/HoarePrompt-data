Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a value based on the following conditions: if `n` is 0, it returns 2; if `n` is 1, it returns 1; for any other positive integer `n`, it calculates and returns the `n`th number in a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1, where each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This covers all potential cases, including edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1, and ensures that the function behaves consistently for all non-negative integers.**
