The code `a, b = b, a + b` swaps the values of `a` and `b` and then updates `b` to be the sum of the original `a` and `b`. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. 

After executing the code, `a` becomes the original value of `b`, which is 1, and `b` becomes the sum of the original `a` and `b`, which is 2 + 1 = 3.

The value of `n` and `_` are not affected by this code. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer not equal to 1, and `_` remains 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 2**
