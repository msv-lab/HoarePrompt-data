According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, which implies `n` is at least 2, so the loop can execute. The loop variable `_` is a throwaway variable, so its value doesn't matter. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `_` is 2**
