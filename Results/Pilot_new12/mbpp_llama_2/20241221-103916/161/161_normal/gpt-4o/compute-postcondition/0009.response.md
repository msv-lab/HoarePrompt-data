According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `_` and `n`. If `_` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2, `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1, so `_` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 3**
