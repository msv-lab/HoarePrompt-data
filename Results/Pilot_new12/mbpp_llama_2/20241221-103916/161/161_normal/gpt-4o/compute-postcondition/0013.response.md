To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is:
```python
for _ in range(2, n + 1):
    a, b = b, a + b
```
Given that `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is initially 2, and `b` is initially 1.

The output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times show a pattern where `a` and `b` are updated based on the previous values of `a` and `b`. Specifically, `a` becomes the old `b`, and `b` becomes the sum of the old `a` and `b`. This is a characteristic of the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. However, in this case, it starts with 2 and 1.

Given that the loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n`, and considering the updates of `a` and `b`, we can infer the following:

- If `n` is 2, the loop will execute once, resulting in `a` being 1 and `b` being 3, as seen in the output state after 1 iteration.
- For any `n` greater than 2, `a` and `b` will continue to be updated according to the Fibonacci-like sequence.

However, to find the general output state after all iterations, we need to understand the pattern and how `a` and `b` relate to `n` after the loop finishes.

In a standard Fibonacci sequence, if we were starting from 0 and 1, the nth Fibonacci number would be the sum of the two preceding ones. Here, we're starting from 2 and 1, so we need to adjust our understanding accordingly.

The key observation is that after the loop finishes, `a` and `b` will hold the values of the `(n-1)`th and `n`th numbers in this modified Fibonacci sequence, respectively, considering the sequence starts with 2 and 1.

Thus, after all iterations, `a` will be the `(n-1)`th number in the sequence that starts with 2 and 1, and `b` will be the `n`th number in the same sequence.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is the `(n-1)`th number in the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the `n`th number in the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1.**
