The code `a, b = b, a + b` simultaneously assigns the value of `b` to `a` and the value of `a + b` to `b`. 

Given the initial state: `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 4.

After executing the code:
- `a` becomes the old value of `b`, which is 4.
- `b` becomes the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`, which is 3 + 4 = 7.

The value of `n` and `_` remains unchanged as they are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 4, `b` is 7, `_` is 4**
