To calculate the output state, let's first understand the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1. In a standard Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1. However, in this case, we start with 2 and 1. So, the sequence would be 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76, and so on.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1.
- `a` is the `(n-1)`th number in this sequence.
- `b` is the `n`th number in this sequence.

The sequence starts as follows:
1. 2 (1st number)
2. 1 (2nd number)
3. 3 (3rd number, because 2 + 1 = 3)
4. 4 (4th number, because 1 + 3 = 4)
5. 7 (5th number, because 3 + 4 = 7)
6. 11 (6th number, because 4 + 7 = 11)
7. 18 (7th number, because 7 + 11 = 18)
8. 29 (8th number, because 11 + 18 = 29)
9. 47 (9th number, because 18 + 29 = 47)
10. 76 (10th number, because 29 + 47 = 76)

And so on.

Since `n` is not equal to 1 and is a positive integer, the smallest value of `n` we consider is 2, which would make `a` the 1st number in the sequence (2) and `b` the 2nd number (1). However, for any `n` greater than 2, `b` will be a number in the sequence that follows the standard Fibonacci-like pattern starting from the 3rd number (3) onwards.

The program returns `b`, which is the `n`th number in the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1.

Output State: **The program returns the nth number in a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1.**
