The original assessment states that the provided program seems to correctly implement the function to find the n'th Lucas number. The output hints support this assessment, as they describe the function's behavior in a way that matches the problem description and the code.

The output hints specify that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the `n`th number in a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1, where each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This is exactly what the Lucas sequence is defined as.

The provided code implements this behavior correctly. It handles the base cases `n == 0` and `n == 1` correctly, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For `n > 1`, it uses a loop to iteratively calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers, which is the definition of the Lucas sequence.

The unit tests provided also confirm that the function is working correctly for different values of n. The output hints do not provide any new information that would contradict the original assessment.

Therefore, I believe the original assessment is accurate, and the program correctly implements the function to find the n'th Lucas number.

Final: **True**
