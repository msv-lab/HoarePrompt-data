The original assessment of the program's correctness seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` is designed to calculate the n'th Lucas number, which is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with different starting values (2 and 1). The function correctly initializes the base cases and uses a loop to iteratively calculate the n'th number in the sequence.

The annotated version of the code provides further insight into the program's behavior and supports the original assessment. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at different points, including the base cases and the state after the for loop has been executed. The annotations confirm that the function returns the correct value for the n'th Lucas number.

The key point that supports the original assessment is the state of the program after the for loop has been executed. The annotations correctly state that `a` is the `(n-1)`th number in the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1, and `b` is the `n`th number in the sequence. This confirms that the function is correctly calculating the n'th Lucas number.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
