Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements a function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but starts with 2 and 1 instead of 1 and 1. The function first checks for the base cases where n is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For any other positive integer n, it initializes the first two numbers in the sequence (a and b) as 2 and 1 and then iteratively calculates the next number in the sequence as the sum of the previous two (a + b). The loop runs from 2 to n (inclusive), ensuring that the function returns the correct n'th Lucas number.

The output hints agree with the code and cover all potential cases, including edge cases where n is 0 or 1. The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function for specific values of n. Therefore, based on the code, output hints, and unit tests, it appears that the function correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number for every potential case.
