Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting values: 2 and 1. The function `func_1` correctly initializes the first two numbers in the sequence (2 and 1) and then uses a loop to calculate the n'th number.

The base cases are handled correctly: when `n` is 0, the function returns 2, and when `n` is 1, the function returns 1. For `n` greater than 1, the function uses a loop to iteratively calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers.

The loop runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive), which ensures that the function calculates the correct n'th Lucas number. The use of tuple assignment `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` is a clever way to update the values of `a` and `b` in each iteration, which makes the code concise and efficient.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. Since I couldn't find any potential case where the program doesn't work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
