Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is defined as a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 2 and 1. The provided code uses a recursive approach with a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number, which makes it efficient for large values of n.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

- It correctly handles the base cases `n == 0` and `n == 1`, returning 2 and 1 respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.
- For `n > 1`, it uses a loop to iteratively calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers, which is the definition of the Lucas sequence.
- The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(9) == 76` and `assert func_1(4) == 7`, also confirm that the function is working correctly for different values of n.

Overall, the code seems to be correctly implemented, and it should work as expected for all non-negative integer inputs.
