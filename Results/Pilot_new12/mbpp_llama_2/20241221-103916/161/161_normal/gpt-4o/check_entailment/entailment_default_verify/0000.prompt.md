You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the function to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is defined as a series of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 2 and 1. The provided code uses a recursive approach with a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number, which makes it efficient for large values of n.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

- It correctly handles the base cases `n == 0` and `n == 1`, returning 2 and 1 respectively, which are the first two numbers in the Lucas sequence.
- For `n > 1`, it uses a loop to iteratively calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers, which is the definition of the Lucas sequence.
- The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(9) == 76` and `assert func_1(4) == 7`, also confirm that the function is working correctly for different values of n.

Overall, the code seems to be correctly implemented, and it should work as expected for all non-negative integer inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a value based on the following conditions: if `n` is 0, it returns 2; if `n` is 1, it returns 1; for any other positive integer `n`, it calculates and returns the `n`th number in a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1, where each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This covers all potential cases, including edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1, and ensures that the function behaves consistently for all non-negative integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
