Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the n'th Lucas number, and the provided function does exactly that. 

The Lucas sequence is a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The function correctly handles the base cases where n is 0 or 1, and for any other positive integer n, it calculates and returns the n'th number in the Lucas sequence.

The function uses a for loop to iterate from 2 to n, and in each iteration, it updates the values of a and b to the next two numbers in the sequence. After the loop finishes, b holds the n'th number in the sequence, which is then returned.

The function also correctly handles the edge cases where n is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively, as defined by the Lucas sequence.

Additionally, the provided unit tests confirm that the function works correctly for different inputs, which further supports the conclusion that the program is correct.

In summary, the program correctly implements the Lucas sequence and meets the problem description, so the correctness is **True**.
