You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but with different starting values: 2 and 1. The function `func_1` correctly initializes the first two numbers in the sequence (2 and 1) and then uses a loop to calculate the n'th number.

The base cases are handled correctly: when `n` is 0, the function returns 2, and when `n` is 1, the function returns 1. For `n` greater than 1, the function uses a loop to iteratively calculate the next number in the sequence by adding the previous two numbers.

The loop runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive), which ensures that the function calculates the correct n'th Lucas number. The use of tuple assignment `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` is a clever way to update the values of `a` and `b` in each iteration, which makes the code concise and efficient.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. Since I couldn't find any potential case where the program doesn't work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is the `(n-1)`th number in the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the `n`th number in the Fibonacci-like sequence starting with 2 and 1.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth number in a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns a value based on the following conditions: if `n` is 0, it returns 2; if `n` is 1, it returns 1; for any other positive integer `n`, it calculates and returns the `n`th number in a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1, where each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. This covers all potential cases, including edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1, and ensures that the function behaves consistently for all non-negative integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
