## Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct because it follows the problem description to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1. 

The program correctly handles the base cases for n = 0 and n = 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For n > 1, it uses a loop to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The loop starts from 2 and iterates up to n, updating the values of `a` and `b` to hold the (n-1)'th and n'th Lucas numbers respectively.

After the loop finishes, the program returns `b`, which is the n'th Lucas number. This matches the problem description, which asks to find the n'th Lucas number.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(9) == 76` and `assert func_1(4) == 7`, also confirm that the function is working correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
