Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the function to find the n'th Lucas number. The problem description states that the function should return the n'th number in a Fibonacci-like sequence that starts with 2 and 1, where each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. The code implements this using a loop that iterates from 2 to n, calculating the next number in the sequence as the sum of the previous two.

The code handles the edge cases correctly, returning 2 when n is 0 and 1 when n is 1. For any other positive integer n, it correctly calculates and returns the n'th number in the sequence. The provided unit tests also support this, showing that the function returns the correct values for n = 3, 4, and 9.

The output hints also agree with the code, describing the function's behavior as expected. There are no apparent cases where the function does not work correctly, and the code appears to cover all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
