#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the 'numbers' list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input, filters out the odd integers, and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. It handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and does not modify the original input list. If the input list contains non-integer values, the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to apply the modulo operation. The returned list will be empty if the input list does not contain any even integers, and will contain all even integers from the input list otherwise.
