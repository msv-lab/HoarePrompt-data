You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == [2, 4]
assert func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]) == [4, 6, 8, 0]
assert func_1([8, 12, 15, 19]) == [8, 12]

def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `numbers` and checks each number `num` to see if it is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. If the number is even, it is included in the output list.

The function correctly handles various input cases, including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with zero. The unit tests provided also validate the function's behavior for different inputs.

After analyzing the function and considering potential edge cases, such as:

* An empty list: `func_1([])` returns an empty list `[]`, which is correct.
* A list with negative numbers: `func_1([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2])` returns `[-2, 0, 2]`, which is correct.
* A list with floating-point numbers: `func_1([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])` returns `[2.0, 4.0]`, which is correct.

Since the function correctly handles these cases and there are no apparent edge cases that it does not handle, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers as input, filters out the odd integers, and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. It handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and does not modify the original input list. If the input list contains non-integer values, the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to apply the modulo operation. The returned list will be empty if the input list does not contain any even integers, and will contain all even integers from the input list otherwise.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
