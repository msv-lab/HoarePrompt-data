Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `numbers` and checks each number `num` to see if it is even by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. If the number is even, it is included in the output list.

The function correctly handles various input cases, including lists with both even and odd numbers, lists with only even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with zero. The unit tests provided also validate the function's behavior for different inputs.

After analyzing the function and considering potential edge cases, such as:

* An empty list: `func_1([])` returns an empty list `[]`, which is correct.
* A list with negative numbers: `func_1([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2])` returns `[-2, 0, 2]`, which is correct.
* A list with floating-point numbers: `func_1([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0])` returns `[2.0, 4.0]`, which is correct.

Since the function correctly handles these cases and there are no apparent edge cases that it does not handle, the program is considered correct.
