Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correct based on the problem description. It filters a list of numbers to return only the even numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list, applying the modulo operation (`num % 2 == 0`) to check if the number is even. If the number is even, it is included in the new list.

The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function accepts a list of integers, filters out the odd integers, and returns a new list containing only the even integers. The hints mention potential issues, such as raising a TypeError if the input list contains non-integer values, but since we assume that the input will be valid, this does not affect the correctness of the function.

The function handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and does not modify the original input list, as stated in the output hints. The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function, demonstrating its ability to filter even numbers from lists.

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the problem description, and no potential case was found where the program does not work as expected.
