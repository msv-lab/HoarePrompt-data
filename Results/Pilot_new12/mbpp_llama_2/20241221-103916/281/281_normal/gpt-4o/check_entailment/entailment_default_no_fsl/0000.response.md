Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements a function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list and checks each number to see if it is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`). If a number is even, it is included in the new list; otherwise, it is skipped.

The output hints provided agree with the code's functionality, stating that it handles lists of any size, does not modify the original input list, and returns an empty list if there are no even integers in the input list.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases, including lists with both even and odd numbers, and lists with only even or only odd numbers.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a list of integers), the code does not need to handle cases where the input is not a list or contains non-integer values. Under these assumptions, the code works correctly for every potential case and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
