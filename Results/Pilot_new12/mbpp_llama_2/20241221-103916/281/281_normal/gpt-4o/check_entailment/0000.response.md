Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to be correct in finding even numbers from a list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`. It checks if a number is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`), and if it is, the number is included in the output list. 

The function handles various input cases as demonstrated by the provided unit tests, including lists with both even and odd numbers, and it correctly identifies the even numbers in these lists. Additionally, the function works with edge cases such as the inclusion of zero, which is an even number.

Without being able to identify a specific case where the function does not work as expected, it is reasonable to conclude that the function is correct for all potential input cases. The use of the modulo operator is a standard approach for determining if a number is even, and the list comprehension is a concise and efficient way to create the output list. Overall, the function appears to satisfy the problem description for every potential case.
