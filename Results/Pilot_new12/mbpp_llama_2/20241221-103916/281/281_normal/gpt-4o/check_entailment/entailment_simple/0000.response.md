The provided Python function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of even numbers from the input list. 

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

* The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`.
* For each number, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`). If this condition is true, the number is even and is included in the output list.
* The function returns a list of all even numbers found in the input list.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios:

* `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[2, 4]`, which are the even numbers in the input list.
* `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1])` returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, which are the even numbers in the input list.
* `func_1([8, 12, 15, 19])` returns `[8, 12]`, which are the even numbers in the input list.

Since the function correctly identifies and returns the even numbers from the input list in all cases, it meets the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
