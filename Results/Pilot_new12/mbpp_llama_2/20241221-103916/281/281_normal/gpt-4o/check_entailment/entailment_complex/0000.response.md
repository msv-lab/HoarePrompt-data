Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly filters out the odd integers from the input list `numbers` and returns a new list containing only the even integers. Here's why:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list.
2. For each number, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`). This condition is true for even numbers and false for odd numbers.
3. If the condition is true, the number is included in the new list.
4. The function returns the new list containing only the even integers.

The function also meets the requirements specified in the comments:

* It handles lists of any size, including empty lists.
* It does not modify the original input list.
* If the input list contains non-integer values, the function will raise a TypeError when attempting to apply the modulo operation (although this is not explicitly handled, it is a natural consequence of the Python interpreter).
* The returned list will be empty if the input list does not contain any even integers, and will contain all even integers from the input list otherwise.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a list of integers), the function will always produce the correct output. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the function's correctness for various input scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
