The original assessment concludes that the provided Python function `func_1` is correct in finding even numbers from a list of numbers, based on the provided unit tests and the standard approach of using the modulo operator to determine if a number is even. This assessment appears to be accurate, as the function correctly handles various input cases and edge cases, such as the inclusion of zero.

The output hints provided further support the correctness of the function. They confirm that the function accepts a list of integers, filters out odd integers, and returns a new list containing only even integers, without modifying the original input list. The hints also mention the function's behavior in cases where the input list contains non-integer values, which is consistent with the expected behavior of the modulo operation.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the function appears to meet all requirements. It correctly identifies even numbers in a list, handles lists of any size, and does not modify the original input list. Therefore, the original assessment of **True** is maintained.

The reasoning behind maintaining the original assessment is that the function's implementation is consistent with the problem description, and the provided output hints further confirm its correctness. The function's behavior in various scenarios, including its handling of edge cases and non-integer values, is well-documented and consistent with expectations.

Final: **True**
