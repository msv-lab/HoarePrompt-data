Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python function, `func_1`, filters out odd numbers from a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list, checks if the number is even by using the modulus operator (`%`), and includes it in the output list if it is even. 

This approach correctly handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and it does not modify the original input list. The function also returns a new list as expected, which can be an empty list if no even numbers were found in the input.

It is assumed that the input will be a valid list of integers, and the function will work correctly under these conditions. The output hints agree with the code, providing additional details about the function's behavior, such as throwing an error for non-integer values, not performing error checking, and handling lists of any size.

Overall, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and it is expected to work correctly for all valid input cases.
