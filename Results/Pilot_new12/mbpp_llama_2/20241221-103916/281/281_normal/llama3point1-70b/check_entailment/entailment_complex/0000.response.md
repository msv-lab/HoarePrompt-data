Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, filters out the odd numbers, and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It correctly identifies even numbers using the modulus operator (`num % 2 == 0`).
2. It returns a list of even integers, which can be empty if no even numbers were found in the input.
3. The program does not modify the original input list, as it creates a new list using a list comprehension.
4. The function handles lists of any size, including empty lists, without any issues.

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a list of integers), the program does not need to perform error checking or handling for non-integer or non-list inputs. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description and the assumptions made about the input.
