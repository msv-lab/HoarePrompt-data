You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to filter out even numbers from a list of numbers. It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`. For each number, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), which is the mathematical definition of an even number. If the condition is met, the number is included in the output list.

This function correctly handles various potential cases:

1. **Empty List**: If an empty list is passed to the function, it will return an empty list, which is the expected result because there are no numbers (even or odd) in an empty list.
2. **List with Only Even Numbers**: If all numbers in the list are even, the function will return a list containing all these even numbers, which aligns with the problem description.
3. **List with Only Odd Numbers**: If the list contains only odd numbers, the function will return an empty list, as there are no even numbers to return, which is also correct.
4. **List with Both Even and Odd Numbers**: The function will correctly filter out the odd numbers and return a list of the even numbers from the input list.
5. **List Containing Zero**: Zero is an even number, and the function will correctly include it in the output list if it is present in the input list.

Since the function behaves as expected in all these scenarios and correctly identifies even numbers from a list according to the problem description, without any known exceptions or edge cases where it fails, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the 'numbers' list


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
