Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to filter out even numbers from a list of numbers. It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `numbers`. For each number, it checks if the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`), which is the mathematical definition of an even number. If the condition is met, the number is included in the output list.

This function correctly handles various potential cases:

1. **Empty List**: If an empty list is passed to the function, it will return an empty list, which is the expected result because there are no numbers (even or odd) in an empty list.
2. **List with Only Even Numbers**: If all numbers in the list are even, the function will return a list containing all these even numbers, which aligns with the problem description.
3. **List with Only Odd Numbers**: If the list contains only odd numbers, the function will return an empty list, as there are no even numbers to return, which is also correct.
4. **List with Both Even and Odd Numbers**: The function will correctly filter out the odd numbers and return a list of the even numbers from the input list.
5. **List Containing Zero**: Zero is an even number, and the function will correctly include it in the output list if it is present in the input list.

Since the function behaves as expected in all these scenarios and correctly identifies even numbers from a list according to the problem description, without any known exceptions or edge cases where it fails, it is considered correct.
