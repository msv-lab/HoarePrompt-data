The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to take a list of numbers as input and return a list of even numbers from that input list. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number `num` in the input list `numbers`.
2. For each number, it checks the condition `num % 2 == 0`. In Python, the modulo operator `%` returns the remainder of the division of the number before it by the number after it. So, `num % 2 == 0` is true if and only if `num` is even (because an even number divided by 2 leaves no remainder).
3. If the condition is true (i.e., the number is even), the number is included in the new list being created by the list comprehension.
4. Once all numbers in the input list have been checked, the function returns the new list containing only the even numbers.

Given this explanation, it's clear that the function `func_1` does exactly what the problem description asks for: it takes a list of numbers and returns a list of even numbers from that list.

Therefore, **Correctness: True**.

This conclusion is based on the assumption that the input will always be a valid list of integers, as specified in the problem statement. The function does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs (like non-integer values, non-list inputs, etc.), but such cases are explicitly excluded from consideration by the problem statement.
