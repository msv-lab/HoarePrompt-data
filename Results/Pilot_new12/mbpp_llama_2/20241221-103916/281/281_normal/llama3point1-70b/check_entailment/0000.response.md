Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements a function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `numbers` and returns a new list containing only the numbers for which the remainder when divided by 2 is 0 (i.e., even numbers). This logic is correct and covers all potential cases, including:

* Empty input list: The function returns an empty list, which is the correct result.
* List with only even numbers: The function returns the input list, which is the correct result.
* List with only odd numbers: The function returns an empty list, which is the correct result.
* List with a mix of even and odd numbers: The function returns a list containing only the even numbers, which is the correct result.

The program handles all possible input cases correctly and does not contain any missing logic or edge cases that would cause it to produce incorrect results. Therefore, the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
