#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the 'numbers' list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input, filters out the odd numbers, and returns a new list containing only the even integers from the original list. It handles lists of any size, including empty lists, and does not modify the original input list. If the input list contains non-integer values, the function will throw an error when attempting to perform the modulus operation. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-integer or non-list inputs, and it assumes that all elements in the input list are integers. The final state of the program after execution is the return of a list of even integers, which can be an empty list if no even numbers were found in the input.
