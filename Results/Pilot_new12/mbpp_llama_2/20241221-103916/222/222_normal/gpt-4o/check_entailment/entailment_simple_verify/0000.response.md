The original assessment of the program's correctness is **False**, and this assessment holds true after considering the annotated version of the code and the problem description. 

The problem requires the removal of lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided function `func_1` simply removes all lowercase characters, not just substrings. This can be seen in the function's implementation, where it uses a list comprehension to filter out characters that are not uppercase, effectively removing all lowercase characters.

The annotated version of the code supports this observation, as it notes that the program returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. This indicates that the function does not preserve the original string's structure, removing all lowercase characters rather than just lowercase substrings.

For instance, given the input string "HELloWORld", the function would return "HELWOR" instead of "HELWORld", which is the expected output if only the lowercase substring "lo" was removed. This discrepancy highlights the program's failure to meet the problem's requirements.

The provided unit tests also support this assessment, as they only cover cases where the function removes individual lowercase characters, rather than substrings. 

Given this analysis, the conclusion is that the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.

Final: **False**
