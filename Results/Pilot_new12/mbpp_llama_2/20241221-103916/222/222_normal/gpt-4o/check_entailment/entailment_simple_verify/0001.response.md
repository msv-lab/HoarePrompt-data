To assess the correctness of the provided Python function `func_1`, we need to understand the problem description and the original assessment, and then evaluate the function based on these.

The problem description asks for a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the original assessment and the provided code interpret this as removing all lowercase characters, not specifically substrings. 

The original assessment concludes that the function is correct with a correctness status of **True**. This assessment is based on the interpretation that the function should remove all lowercase characters from the string, effectively treating individual lowercase characters as substrings of length 1. The provided unit tests (`assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'`, `assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'`, `assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'`) support this interpretation, as they demonstrate the removal of lowercase characters from the input strings.

The annotated version of the code reinforces this interpretation. The annotation states that the program returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`, which is consistent with the approach of removing lowercase characters.

Given this analysis, if we strictly follow the problem description's potential ambiguity and the functionality implemented by `func_1`, it appears that the original assessment aligns with the functionality provided by the code. However, the crucial point here is how one interprets "remove lowercase substrings." If the task implies removing sequences of lowercase characters (which could be more than one character), the current implementation still meets a practical interpretation where single-character substrings are also considered.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the original assessment seems accurate under the interpretation that removing "lowercase substrings" can be reasonably understood as removing all lowercase characters, considering each character as a potential substring of length 1.

Final: **True**
