Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. 

The problem description asks for a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string. This can be interpreted as removing all lowercase characters, since a single lowercase character is also a substring.

The provided function `func_1` uses list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s`. It checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper` method, and if it is, includes it in the resulting string. All lowercase characters are effectively removed, which aligns with the problem description.

The unit tests provided also confirm this interpretation, as they test the function with strings containing both uppercase and lowercase characters and verify that the function correctly returns a string with only the uppercase characters.

Therefore, the program is correct, as it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
