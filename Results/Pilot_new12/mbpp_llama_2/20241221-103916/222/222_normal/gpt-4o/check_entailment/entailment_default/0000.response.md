Correctness: **False**.

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It removes all lowercase characters from the string, but it also removes digits and special characters. The problem description only asks to remove lowercase substrings, not all lowercase characters. For example, if the input string is 'aBcDe', the function should return 'B', but it does not handle cases where the lowercase characters appear in a sequence (substring) correctly. 

Another example is if the input string is 'abCD', the function should return 'CD' because 'ab' is a lowercase substring, but it does not return the correct result because it removes individual characters, not substrings.

The unit tests provided do not cover all edge cases and do not provide enough information to confirm the correctness of the function. However, based on the problem description, we can conclude that the function does not meet the requirements. 

A correct function should scan the string to find sequences of lowercase characters and remove those sequences, not individual characters.
