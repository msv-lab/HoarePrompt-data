The original Assessment claims that the provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, it removes all lowercase characters.

Upon re-examining the problem description, the code, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment. The function `func_1` does indeed remove all lowercase characters from the input string, rather than removing lowercase substrings. The output hints confirm that the function filters out any lowercase characters, which is not equivalent to removing lowercase substrings.

The key insight here is that removing lowercase substrings would involve identifying sequences of lowercase characters and removing them as a whole, whereas the provided function removes individual lowercase characters.

For example, given the input string "HELloWORld", the function would return "HELWORLD", which is not correct according to the problem description. A correct implementation would return "HELWORld", as the entire substring "lo" should be removed, not just the individual characters.

The output hints do not provide any evidence to contradict the original assessment. In fact, they confirm that the function behaves as described in the original assessment, filtering out individual lowercase characters rather than removing lowercase substrings.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment.

Final: **False**
