Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, it removes all lowercase characters. The function uses a list comprehension to filter out characters that are not uppercase, effectively removing all lowercase characters, not just substrings.

A correct implementation would involve identifying and removing sequences of lowercase characters. For example, given the input string "HELloWORld", a correct output would be "HELWORld", not "HELWOR". 

The provided unit tests also do not cover cases where the function should remove a substring of lowercase characters, rather than individual characters. 

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements as described, making it incorrect.
