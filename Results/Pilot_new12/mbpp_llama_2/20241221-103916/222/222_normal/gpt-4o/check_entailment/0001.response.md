Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. It utilizes a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the string `s` and checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper` method. If the character is uppercase, it is included in the new list, which is then joined into a string.

This function works correctly for all potential cases because it correctly identifies and removes lowercase characters, effectively removing lowercase substrings. The unit tests provided also validate its correctness by comparing the output of the function with the expected output for different inputs.

The function's logic is straightforward and does not contain any missing edge cases that would cause it to fail. It handles strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, strings with only uppercase or lowercase characters, and empty strings (although this last case is not explicitly tested, it would still return an empty string, which is the expected result).

In summary, the function `func_1` correctly removes lowercase substrings from a given string, making it a correct implementation according to the provided problem description.
