The function accepts a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`, effectively filtering out any lowercase characters, digits, or special characters. The function handles all possible input strings, including empty strings, strings with no uppercase characters, and strings containing a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters. If the input string `s` is empty, the function returns an empty string. If the input string `s` contains no uppercase characters, the function returns an empty string. The original input string `s` remains unchanged, and the function does not have any side effects. The returned string contains the uppercase characters in the same order as they appeared in the original string `s`.
