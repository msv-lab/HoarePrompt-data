The code is appending the third character of string `s` to `result`. The initial state provides that `s` is a string with at least 3 characters and `char` is the third character in `s`. 

The value of `result` is increased by `char`, which is the third character in `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `s`, `result` is increased by the third character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `s`, `result` is the original value of `result` plus the third character of `s`**
