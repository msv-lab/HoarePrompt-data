According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must have at least 3 characters and `char` is the third character in `s`.
State: **`s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `s`**
