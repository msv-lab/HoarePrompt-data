To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and the impact of the given code on it.

Initial State: `s` is a string with at least 2 characters, and `char` is the second character in the string `s`.

Given Code: `result += char`

The code is adding the value of `char` (which is the second character of string `s`) to `result`. 

However, we need to note that the initial state does not specify the value of `result` before this operation. Assuming `result` is initially a string (since we're concatenating a character to it, and in Python, `+=` with strings means concatenation), after the operation, `result` will be the initial value of `result` plus the second character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the string `s`, `result` is the initial value of `result` plus `char` (or the second character of `s`)**. 

However, without knowing the initial value of `result`, we cannot simplify further. If we assume `result` was initially an empty string or any specific string, we could simplify it to `result` being that initial string plus the second character of `s`. But since the problem doesn't specify `result`'s initial value, we leave it as is.
