The code Appends the value of `char` to `result`. The previous value of `result` was an empty string, and the value of `char` is the first character in the string `s`, which is an uppercase letter. 

So, `result` becomes an empty string plus the first character of `s`, which is the same as the first character of `s`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `result` is a string containing the first character of `s`, and `char` is the first character in the string `s`, and the current value of `char` is an uppercase letter.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `result` is equal to the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character in the string `s` and is an uppercase letter**
