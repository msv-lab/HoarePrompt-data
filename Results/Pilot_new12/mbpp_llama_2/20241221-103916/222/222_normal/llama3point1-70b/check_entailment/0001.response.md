Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1(s)`, takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that includes only the uppercase characters from the original string. It iterates over each character in the input string, checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method, and if so, appends it to the `result` string.

This solution correctly implements the problem description, which asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. By removing all lowercase characters, it effectively removes any substrings that consist of lowercase characters, as there will be no lowercase characters left in the resulting string to form any substrings.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the function will return "HW", which is correct since it has removed all lowercase characters, thus removing any potential lowercase substrings.

The function handles all possible cases correctly, including:

- Strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters.
- Strings consisting entirely of uppercase characters (it returns the original string).
- Strings consisting entirely of lowercase characters (it returns an empty string, which is correct since all lowercase characters, and thus any substrings formed by them, are removed).
- Empty strings (it returns an empty string, which is correct as there are no characters to process).

Given that the function correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description, it is considered correct.
