Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided program removes individual lowercase characters, not substrings.

In other words, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HW", which is not the expected result if the goal is to remove lowercase substrings. The expected result in this case would be "HW" as well, because "ello" and "orld" are lowercase substrings, but if the input string is "HeLloWorLd", the program will return "HWL", not "HW" as it should if it was removing lowercase substrings.

This discrepancy arises because the program checks each character individually, rather than checking sequences of characters for being all lowercase. Therefore, it does not fulfill the task specified in the problem description. 

For example, consider the string "aAbc". This string contains a lowercase substring "a" and a mix of both lowercase and uppercase characters "bc" and also an uppercase character "A" with the letter "b" and "c" being lowercase. The expected output should be "Abc" if only standalone lowercase characters "a" are removed, but if all lowercase substrings are removed it should be "A". However, the provided function will return "A", which is correct for the specific case of removing all lowercase characters, but incorrect in the context of the task as specified, because it does not consider sequences of lowercase characters that are interspersed with uppercase characters. 

The correct program should identify sequences of lowercase characters within the string and remove them entirely, which the given function does not do. It only removes individual lowercase characters, not substrings.
