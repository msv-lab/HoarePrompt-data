You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires the removal of lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided program removes all lowercase characters individually, not substrings. 

For example, given the string "aBcDe", the program will return "BDE", which is correct. But for the string "Hello world", if we consider "world" as a lowercase substring, the program will return "H", because it removes each lowercase character individually, not the entire substring "world". 

To fix this, the function should iterate over the string and check if a substring is entirely lowercase, then remove that substring. The provided function does not achieve this, so it is incorrect. 

Here's a counterexample: if the input string is "Hello world", the expected output should be "Hello ", but the function will return "H". This shows that the function does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the input string.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from `s`. If the input string `s` is empty, the function returns an empty string. If the input string `s` contains no uppercase characters, the function also returns an empty string. The original string `s` remains unchanged. The function handles strings with any combination of uppercase and lowercase characters, and it does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input will always be a string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
