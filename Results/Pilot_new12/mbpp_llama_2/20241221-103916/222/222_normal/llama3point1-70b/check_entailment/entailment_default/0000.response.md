Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided appears to correctly remove lowercase substrings from a given string. It iterates over each character in the string, and if the character is an uppercase letter (checked using the `isupper()` method), it appends it to the result string. If the character is lowercase, it is skipped, effectively removing it from the resulting string. 

This approach handles all potential cases as described in the problem description:
- It handles strings with any combination of uppercase and lowercase characters.
- It correctly returns an empty string when the input string is empty or contains no uppercase characters.
- The original string remains unchanged, as the function creates a new string to store the result.
- It does not attempt to remove substrings per se but rather filters out lowercase characters, which aligns with the interpretation of "removing lowercase substrings" as removing all lowercase characters (since substrings are sequences of characters).

Given the assumptions that the input will always be a string and that the task focuses on filtering out lowercase characters (as an interpretation of "removing lowercase substrings"), the code seems to fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
