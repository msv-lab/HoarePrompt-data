Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires the removal of lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided program removes all lowercase characters individually, not substrings. 

For example, given the string "aBcDe", the program will return "BDE", which is correct. But for the string "Hello world", if we consider "world" as a lowercase substring, the program will return "H", because it removes each lowercase character individually, not the entire substring "world". 

To fix this, the function should iterate over the string and check if a substring is entirely lowercase, then remove that substring. The provided function does not achieve this, so it is incorrect. 

Here's a counterexample: if the input string is "Hello world", the expected output should be "Hello ", but the function will return "H". This shows that the function does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the input string.
