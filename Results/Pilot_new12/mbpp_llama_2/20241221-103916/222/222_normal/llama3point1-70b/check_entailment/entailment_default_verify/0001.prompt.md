You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1(s)`, takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that includes only the uppercase characters from the original string. It iterates over each character in the input string, checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method, and if so, appends it to the `result` string.

This solution correctly implements the problem description, which asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. By removing all lowercase characters, it effectively removes any substrings that consist of lowercase characters, as there will be no lowercase characters left in the resulting string to form any substrings.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the function will return "HW", which is correct since it has removed all lowercase characters, thus removing any potential lowercase substrings.

The function handles all possible cases correctly, including:

- Strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters.
- Strings consisting entirely of uppercase characters (it returns the original string).
- Strings consisting entirely of lowercase characters (it returns an empty string, which is correct since all lowercase characters, and thus any substrings formed by them, are removed).
- Empty strings (it returns an empty string, which is correct as there are no characters to process).

Given that the function correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from `s`. If the input string `s` is empty, the function returns an empty string. If the input string `s` contains no uppercase characters, the function also returns an empty string. The original string `s` remains unchanged. The function handles strings with any combination of uppercase and lowercase characters, and it does not perform any error checking on the input, so it assumes that the input will always be a string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
