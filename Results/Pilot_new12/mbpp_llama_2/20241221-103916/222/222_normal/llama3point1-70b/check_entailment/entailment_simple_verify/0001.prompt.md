You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1(s)`, takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that includes only the uppercase characters from the original string. It iterates over each character in the input string, checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method, and if so, appends it to the `result` string.

This solution correctly implements the problem description, which asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. By removing all lowercase characters, it effectively removes any substrings that consist of lowercase characters, as there will be no lowercase characters left in the resulting string to form any substrings.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the function will return "HW", which is correct since it has removed all lowercase characters, thus removing any potential lowercase substrings.

The function handles all possible cases correctly, including:

- Strings with a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters.
- Strings consisting entirely of uppercase characters (it returns the original string).
- Strings consisting entirely of lowercase characters (it returns an empty string, which is correct since all lowercase characters, and thus any substrings formed by them, are removed).
- Empty strings (it returns an empty string, which is correct as there are no characters to process).

Given that the function correctly handles all potential cases according to the problem description, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `char` is the last character of `s` if `s` is not empty, and `result` is a string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`.
    return result
    #The program returns a string containing all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
