Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided code simply removes all lowercase characters, not substrings. A substring is a sequence of characters within a string, so the code should check for sequences of lowercase characters and remove them, not just individual lowercase characters.

For example, if the input string is "Hello world", the code should remove the substring " world" (including the space), but it only removes the individual lowercase characters "w", "o", "r", "l", and "d", resulting in "H". 

To correctly solve the problem, the code should be modified to identify and remove sequences of lowercase characters, not just individual lowercase characters.
