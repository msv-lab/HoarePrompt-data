Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the program removes all lowercase characters, not substrings. 

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HW", but the expected output should be "HW" as well because "ello" and "orld" are considered as substrings that need to be removed, but since "hello" is not a standalone substring it should be split into individual characters to see if each one is upper or lower case. The real issue comes when we have "aBc" as an input where "a" and "c" are substrings (length 1) and they are lower case, but "B" is not a substring of lower case, so the output should be "B". 

However, the problem arises in a string like "abc" where the expected output is an empty string because "abc" is a substring of lower case characters. But in a string like "aBc" the output should be "B". 

To correctly solve this problem, we would need a more complex algorithm that checks all substrings of the string and removes them if they are entirely lowercase.

Here is a correct example of a Python function that removes all lowercase substrings from a string:

```python
def remove_lowercase_substrings(s):
    result = s
    for length in range(len(s), 0, -1):
        for i in range(len(s) - length + 1):
            substring = s[i:i+length]
            if substring.islower():
                result = result.replace(substring, '')
    return result
```
