To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

Given Initial State: `n` is a positive integer.

The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
```
This code snippet generates a list of even numbers from 2 up to `2n` (inclusive) using a list comprehension.

Here's the breakdown:
- `range(1, n + 1)` generates a sequence of numbers from 1 up to `n` (inclusive).
- For each number `i` in this sequence, `2 * i` calculates the corresponding even number.
- The resulting even numbers are collected in a list called `even_numbers`.

Thus, `even_numbers` will contain all even numbers from 2 up to `2n`, because the sequence of `i` goes from 1 to `n`, and multiplying each `i` by 2 gives the sequence of even numbers from 2 to `2n`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer, the output state is as follows:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `even_numbers` is a list containing all even numbers from 2 up to `2n`, calculated as `[2, 4, 6,..., 2n]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `even_numbers` is a list of even numbers from 2 to `2n`**
