The program returns `cube_sum` which is equal to the sum of cubes of all even numbers from 2 to `2n`. Since `n` is a positive integer, `2n` will be an even number. The cube sum is calculated as `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 +... + (2n)^3`, where all the numbers being cubed are even numbers from 2 to `2n`.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of cubes of all even numbers from 2 to 2n, where n is a positive integer**
