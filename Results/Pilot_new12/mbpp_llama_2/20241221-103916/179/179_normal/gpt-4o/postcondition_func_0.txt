The function accepts a positive integer parameter `n` and returns the sum of cubes of all even numbers from 2 to 2n. It does not modify the input parameter `n` and only performs the calculation based on the provided value. The function handles all positive integer values of `n` correctly, regardless of their magnitude. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function's behavior is undefined, as it does not include any error checking or handling for invalid inputs. The function's return value is the sum of cubes of the even numbers in the specified range, which is a single numeric value.
