Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The program generates a list of the first n even natural numbers using a list comprehension: `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This is correct because it starts from 2 (which is the first even natural number) and goes up to 2n.

2. It then calculates the cube sum of these numbers using a generator expression: `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)`. This is also correct because it raises each number to the power of 3 and sums them up.

3. The program returns the calculated cube sum, which is the desired output according to the problem description.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the correctness of the program for different inputs. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and its correctness is verified.
