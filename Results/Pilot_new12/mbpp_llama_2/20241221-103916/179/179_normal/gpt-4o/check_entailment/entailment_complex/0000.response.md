Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input, generates a list of the first `n` even numbers using a list comprehension, calculates the sum of the cubes of these numbers using a generator expression, and returns this sum.

The function correctly generates the sequence of even numbers from 2 to 2n, where n is a positive integer. For example, if n = 3, the function generates the sequence [2, 4, 6], calculates the sum of their cubes (2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288), and returns this sum.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1(2) == 72` and `assert func_1(3) == 288`, demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different inputs. The function's behavior is consistent with the problem description, and it handles all positive integer values of n correctly.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
