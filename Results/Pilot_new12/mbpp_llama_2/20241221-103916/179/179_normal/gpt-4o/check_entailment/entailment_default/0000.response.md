Correctness: **True**

The code correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first n even natural numbers. The problem description asks for the sum of cubes of the first n even natural numbers, which is achieved by generating the even numbers from 2 to 2n using a list comprehension, and then summing the cubes of these numbers using a generator expression.

The output hints confirm that the function handles all positive integer values of n correctly and returns the sum of cubes of the even numbers in the specified range. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for different values of n.

The function assumes that the input n is a positive integer, which is a valid assumption based on the problem description. The function does not include error checking or handling for invalid inputs, but this is not a requirement based on the problem statement.

In every potential case, the code correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first n even natural numbers, so I conclude that the code is correct.
