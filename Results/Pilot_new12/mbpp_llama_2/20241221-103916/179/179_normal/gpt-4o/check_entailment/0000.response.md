Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. The list comprehension `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]` generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers by multiplying each integer from 1 to `n` by 2.

2. The expression `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))` calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers. The generator expression `(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` cubes each number in the `even_numbers` list, and the built-in `sum` function adds up these cubes.

The unit tests `assert func_1(2) == 72`, `assert func_1(3) == 288`, and `assert func_1(4) == 800` demonstrate the correctness of this function for specific inputs.

For example, when `n = 2`, the even numbers are 2 and 4, and the sum of their cubes is `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`. When `n = 3`, the even numbers are 2, 4, and 6, and the sum of their cubes is `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`. When `n = 4`, the even numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8, and the sum of their cubes is `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`.

Since the function works correctly for these test cases, and its logic is sound, it should work correctly for any positive integer `n`.
