#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
    #The program returns the sum of the cubes of the even integers from 2 to 2n, where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `n`, a positive integer, and returns the sum of the cubes of the even integers from 2 to `2n`. The function does not modify the input parameter `n` and only performs a calculation based on its value. After the function concludes, the program state will be updated with the returned sum, which can be used for further processing or stored in a variable. The function handles all positive integer values of `n` without any restrictions or exceptions, and the returned sum will always be a non-negative integer. The function does not handle non-integer or non-positive values of `n`, and its behavior may be undefined in such cases.
