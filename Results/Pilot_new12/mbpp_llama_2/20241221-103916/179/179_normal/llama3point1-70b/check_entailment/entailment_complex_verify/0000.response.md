The original assessment of the program states that it correctly calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, we can see that the function indeed calculates the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive) for a given positive integer `n`.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function does not modify the input parameter `n` and only performs a calculation based on its value, which aligns with the problem description. The function handles all positive integer values of `n` without any restrictions or exceptions, and the returned sum will always be a non-negative integer.

However, we must consider the problem description, which asks for the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The code provided calculates the sum of cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n`, which is equivalent to the first `n` even natural numbers (2, 4, 6,..., 2n).

Based on this analysis, the original assessment is accurate. The function correctly implements the mathematical operation described in the problem statement, and there are no apparent edge cases that it fails to handle, given the assumption that the input will always be a valid positive integer.

Therefore, the program's correctness is confirmed by the annotated version and the problem description.

Final: **True**
