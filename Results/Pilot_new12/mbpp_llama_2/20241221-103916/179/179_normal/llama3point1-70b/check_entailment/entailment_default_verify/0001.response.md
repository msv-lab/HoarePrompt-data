To assess the correctness of the program, we must compare it to the problem description and evaluate how it aligns with the provided output hints. The problem asks for a function to calculate the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The given Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to do this by summing the cubes of even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive), which indeed corresponds to the first `n` even natural numbers.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, citing its ability to correctly calculate the cube sum for the first `n` even natural numbers, handling various cases without apparent issues. This assessment aligns with the problem description and the functionality of the provided code.

The output hints further support this assessment by detailing the function's behavior, including:
- Accepting a positive integer `n` as input.
- Returning the sum of the cubes of even integers from 2 to `2n`, which aligns with the problem description.
- Not modifying the input parameter `n`.
- Handling all positive integer values of `n` without restrictions or exceptions.
- Returning a non-negative integer sum.

However, the output hints also note that the function does not handle non-integer or non-positive values of `n`, which could potentially be a point of contention regarding the program's correctness. Yet, the problem statement and the output hints assume that the input will always be a valid positive integer, which means the program's behavior for invalid inputs is outside the scope of the problem description.

Given this information, the original assessment that the program is correct remains accurate. The program does indeed calculate the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers as requested, and the output hints provide additional context that supports this conclusion without introducing any evidence that would contradict the original assessment.

Therefore, based on the alignment between the program's functionality, the problem description, and the supporting output hints, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
