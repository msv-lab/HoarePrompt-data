Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

- The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of even numbers from 2 to `n * 2` (inclusive) with a step size of 2. This effectively generates the first `n` even natural numbers.
- For each number `i` in this range, the function calculates `i ** 3`, which is the cube of `i`.
- The `sum` function is then used to calculate the sum of these cubes.

This approach correctly implements the problem description, and there are no apparent edge cases that are not handled. For example:

- When `n` is 1, the function correctly returns the cube of the first even natural number (2^3 = 8).
- When `n` is 2, the function correctly returns the sum of the cubes of the first two even natural numbers (2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72).
- When `n` is 3, the function correctly returns the sum of the cubes of the first three even natural numbers (2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288).

In general, the function seems to work correctly for all positive integer values of `n`. Therefore, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct.
