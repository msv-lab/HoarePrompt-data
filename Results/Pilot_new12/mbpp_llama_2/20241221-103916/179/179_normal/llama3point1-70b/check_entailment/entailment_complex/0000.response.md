Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of the cubes of the even integers from 2 to 2n, which are the first n even natural numbers.

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

- The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of even numbers from 2 to 2n (inclusive), which are the first n even natural numbers.
- For each even number `i` in this range, it calculates the cube of `i` using `i ** 3`.
- The `sum` function then adds up these cubes to produce the total sum.
- The function returns this sum, which is the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers, exactly as required by the problem description.

Therefore, for every valid input (a positive integer `n`), the function will correctly calculate and return the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers, making it correct according to the problem description.
