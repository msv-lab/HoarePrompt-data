To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to understand what the problem description asks for and then see if the program meets those requirements.

The problem description is to write a Python function to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The first n even natural numbers would be 2, 4, 6,..., up to the nth even number. The nth even natural number can be represented as 2n.

The given program is:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
```
This program uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to calculate the sum of the cubes of numbers in the range from 2 to `n * 2` (inclusive), with a step of 2, which effectively generates the sequence of even numbers starting from 2.

For any positive integer `n`, the `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` will generate the first `n` even natural numbers because it starts at 2, ends at `2n` (since `n * 2` would be the `n`th even number and `+1` ensures it's included), and increments by 2 each time.

Thus, when it calculates `i ** 3` for each `i` in this range and sums these values, it effectively calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the function described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
