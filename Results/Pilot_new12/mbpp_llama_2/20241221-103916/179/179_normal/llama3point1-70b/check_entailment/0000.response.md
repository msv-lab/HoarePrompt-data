Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the range of even numbers from 2 to `n * 2` (inclusive) with a step of 2, cubes each number, and sums them up.

The function works correctly for all positive integer values of `n`. For example, if `n` is 3, the function will calculate the sum of cubes of the first 3 even natural numbers: 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

* The range `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates the first `n` even natural numbers.
* The expression `i ** 3` calculates the cube of each even number.
* The `sum` function adds up the cubes of all the even numbers.

Since the function correctly implements the mathematical operation described in the problem statement, and there are no apparent edge cases that it fails to handle, it can be concluded that the program is correct. 

To verify the function's correctness, you can test it with various inputs and compare the results with manually calculated values. For instance:

```python
print(func_1(1))  # Output: 8 (2^3)
print(func_1(2))  # Output: 8 + 64 (2^3 + 4^3)
print(func_1(3))  # Output: 8 + 64 + 216 (2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3)
```
