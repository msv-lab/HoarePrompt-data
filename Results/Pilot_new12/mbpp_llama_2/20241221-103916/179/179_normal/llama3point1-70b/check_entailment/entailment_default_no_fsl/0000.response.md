Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the even numbers from 2 to `2n` (inclusive), cubes each number using the exponentiation operator `**`, and sums up the results using the built-in `sum` function. 

The output hints agree with the code's functionality and do not indicate any missing logic or edge cases that are not handled by the code. 

Since we assume that the input will be valid (i.e., a positive integer), the function will work correctly for all such inputs. It does not need to handle non-integer or non-positive values of `n` because these are outside the assumed input domain.

For example, if `n` is 3, the function will calculate the sum of the cubes of the first 3 even natural numbers: 2, 4, and 6. The calculation will be `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`, which is the correct result. 

In general, the function will correctly calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers for any positive integer `n`.
