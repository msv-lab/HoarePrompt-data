The function accepts a list `nested_list` that may contain integers and/or other lists, which may also be nested, and returns a one-dimensional list containing all elements from the original list, effectively flattening it. The function can handle arbitrary levels of nesting and returns an empty list if the input list is empty. The input list remains unchanged as the function operates on a copy of its elements. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list inputs or non-integer, non-list elements within the input list, so its behavior may be unpredictable in such cases. After the function concludes, the input `nested_list` and its internal state remain unchanged, but the function returns a new list `flat_list` containing the flattened result.
