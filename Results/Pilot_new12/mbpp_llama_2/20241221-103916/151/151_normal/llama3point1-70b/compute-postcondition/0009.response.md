The given code is attempting to append the value of `i` to `flat_list`. However, `flat_list` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it is a list that has been initialized before this code snippet is executed.

Given that `i` is the second element of `nested_list`, `i` is appended to `flat_list`. 

The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged as the code snippet only involves appending to `flat_list`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list that must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` contains all its previous elements and the second element of `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains all its previous elements and the value of `i`**
