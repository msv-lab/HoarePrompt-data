To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given:
- `nested_list` is a list that must contain at least one element.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.
- The first element of `nested_list`, denoted as `i`, is a list.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
```

This code extends `flat_list` with the elements returned by `func_1(i)`, where `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and is a list itself. The function `func_1` is not defined in the provided information, but its purpose seems to be to process the input list `i` (which is the first element of `nested_list`) and return a list of elements that will then be added to `flat_list`.

Without the specific definition of `func_1`, we can't determine the exact elements that will be added to `flat_list`. However, we know that `flat_list` will no longer be empty after this operation because it will be extended with the return value of `func_1(i)`, which is expected to be a list.

Thus, the output state, considering the information provided, is:
- `nested_list` is a list that must contain at least one element, and its first element `i` is a list.
- `flat_list` is a list containing the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least one element with its first element `i` being a list, `flat_list` is a list extended with the return value of `func_1(i)`, which is expected to be a list of elements resulting from processing `i`.**
