The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, which may also be nested. After executing the function body, the function returns a `flat_list` which is a flattened version of the original `nested_list`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a nested list and return a one-dimensional list containing all elements from the original list, with all nested lists processed and their elements added to the result, or an empty list if the input was empty.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, a list that may contain integers and/or nested lists, and returns a one-dimensional list containing all elements from the original list.**
