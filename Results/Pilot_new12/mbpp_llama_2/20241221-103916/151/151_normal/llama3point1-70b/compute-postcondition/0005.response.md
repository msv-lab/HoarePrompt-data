The code appends the value of `i` to `flat_list`. Since `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and its type is not a list, `i` is appended to `flat_list` as is. 

The value of `nested_list` remains unchanged. The state of `i` remains the same as it is not changed by the append operation. The length of `flat_list` is now at least 1 because it had at least one element appended to it.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must contain at least one element, `flat_list` is a list containing the first element of `nested_list`, `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and the type of `i` is not a list**
