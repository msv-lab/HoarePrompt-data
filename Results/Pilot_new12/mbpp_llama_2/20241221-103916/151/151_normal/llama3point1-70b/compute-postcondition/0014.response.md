Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that contains at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` is extended by the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. If `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains all its previous elements and an additional element which is the third element of `nested_list` (`nested_list[2]`).***
