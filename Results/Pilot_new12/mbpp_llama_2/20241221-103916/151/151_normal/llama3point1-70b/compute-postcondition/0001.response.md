To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in nested_list`, which means the loop will iterate over each element in `nested_list`. 

For this loop to execute, `nested_list` must be defined and must contain at least one element. The type of elements in `nested_list` (whether they are integers or other lists) does not affect the loop's ability to start executing, as the loop iterates over the elements of `nested_list` regardless of their type.

The variable `i` will take the value of each element in `nested_list` during each iteration. Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined in the context of the loop, but once the loop begins, `i` will be the first element of `nested_list`.

The state of `flat_list` being an empty list does not affect the loop's ability to execute, as `flat_list` is not involved in the loop statement.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are that `nested_list` must contain at least one element, and `i` will be the first element of `nested_list` at the start of the loop. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list that must contain at least one element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `i` is the first element of `nested_list`**
