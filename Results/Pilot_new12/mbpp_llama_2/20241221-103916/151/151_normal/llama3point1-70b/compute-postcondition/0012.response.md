To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `nested_list` is a list that must contain at least three elements.
- `i` is the third element of `nested_list`.

The code snippet is:
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
```

This line of code extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(i)`. 

Since `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, `func_1(i)` is applied to this third element. However, the definition or behavior of `func_1` is not provided. Therefore, we can only describe the effect of this line in terms of its general function.

Given that:
- `func_1(i)` applies some function to the third element of `nested_list` (which is `i`).
- The result of `func_1(i)` is then used to extend `flat_list`.

Assuming `func_1` returns a list (or an iterable, since `extend` can work with any iterable), `flat_list` will be extended by the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.

The outcome for `nested_list` and `i` remains unchanged since this operation does not modify them directly. However, `flat_list` will now include additional elements resulting from `func_1(i)`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `nested_list` is a list that must contain at least three elements.
- `i` is the third element of `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` is extended by the result of applying `func_1` to `i`, the third element of `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` is extended by the elements returned by `func_1(i)`, where `i` equals the third element of `nested_list`.**
