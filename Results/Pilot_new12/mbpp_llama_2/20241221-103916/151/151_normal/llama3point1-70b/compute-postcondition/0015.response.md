To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, it extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(i)`, which presumably flattens the list `i` into a one-dimensional list (though the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, its purpose can be inferred from the context). If `i` is not a list (i.e., it's an integer or any other non-list type), it simply appends `i` to `flat_list`.

From the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can infer the following patterns:
- `nested_list` must contain at least as many elements as the number of iterations that have occurred.
- `i` takes on the value of the current element being processed in `nested_list`.
- `flat_list` accumulates elements from `nested_list`, either by appending individual non-list elements or by extending with the flattened versions of sublists (via `func_1(i)`).

Given these observations, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `nested_list` would have been fully traversed, meaning every element in it has been processed.
- `i` would be the last element in `nested_list`, since it takes on the value of the current element being processed, and after the loop, it would be the last one processed.
- `flat_list` would contain a flattened version of all elements in `nested_list`, including any nested lists processed by `func_1`. If `nested_list` was empty, `flat_list` would remain an empty list, as there would be no elements to process.

Therefore, considering the loop's behavior and the patterns observed from the partial output states, the output state after all iterations can be described as follows:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may have been fully or partially traversed depending on its original contents, `i` is the last element of the original `nested_list` if it is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined in this context since the loop wouldn't execute, and `flat_list` contains a flattened version of the original `nested_list`, with all nested lists having been processed by `func_1` and their elements added to `flat_list`, or remains an empty list if the original `nested_list` was empty.**
