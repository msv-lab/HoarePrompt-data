To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given that `nested_list` must contain at least one element and `i` is the first element of `nested_list`, for the loop to execute again, `nested_list` must have at least two elements. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was the first element. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should become the second element of `nested_list`. 

If the type of the new `i` (the second element of `nested_list`) is a list, then `flat_list` will be extended with the return value of `func_1(i)`, which is a list of elements resulting from processing the new `i`. 

If the type of the new `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` will contain the new `i` which is the second element of `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `nested_list`**
