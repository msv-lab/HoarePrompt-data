To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `nested_list` is a list that must contain at least two elements.
- `i` is the second element of `nested_list`.

The given code snippet is:
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
```

From the initial state and the code snippet, we understand that:
- `i` is directly related to `nested_list` as it is the second element of `nested_list`.
- The function `func_1(i)` is applied to `i`, and its return value is extended to `flat_list`.

Since the specifics of `func_1(i)` are not provided, we can only generalize its impact as follows:
- `func_1(i)` takes the second element of `nested_list` (`i`) and performs some operation on it, returning a value.
- The returned value of `func_1(i)` is then added to `flat_list` using the `extend` method.

Given that we do not know the exact nature of `func_1(i)` or the structure of `flat_list` initially, the most accurate description of the output state is:
- `nested_list` remains unchanged as it is not directly modified by the given code.
- `i` remains the second element of `nested_list`, unchanged by the given code.
- `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(i)`, meaning its contents are modified by adding the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.

Thus, the output state, considering the provided information and the changes made by the code, is:
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must contain at least two elements, `i` is the second element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` is extended by the elements returned from `func_1(i)`.**
