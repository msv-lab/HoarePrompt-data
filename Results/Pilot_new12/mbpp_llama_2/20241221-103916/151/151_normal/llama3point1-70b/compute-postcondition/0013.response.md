The code `flat_list.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the end of `flat_list`. The initial state specifies that `nested_list` is a list with at least three elements and `i` is the third element of `nested_list`. 

Since `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, we can express `i` as `nested_list[2]`. 

The state of `nested_list` and the value of `i` are not changed by this code. The only change is that `flat_list` now contains an additional element, which is the third element of `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must contain at least three elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list` (`i` = `nested_list[2]`), `flat_list` contains all its previous elements and an additional element which is the third element of `nested_list` (`nested_list[2]`)**
