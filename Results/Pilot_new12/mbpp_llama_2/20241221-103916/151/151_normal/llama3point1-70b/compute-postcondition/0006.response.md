Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that must contain at least one element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list`. If the type of `i` is a list, then `flat_list` is extended with the return value of `func_1(i)`, which is a list of elements resulting from processing `i`. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list` which is `i` and is not a list.***
