#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, which may also be nested.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))

            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list that may have been fully or partially traversed depending on its original contents, `i` is the last element of the original `nested_list` if it is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined in this context since the loop wouldn't execute, and `flat_list` contains a flattened version of the original `nested_list`, with all nested lists having been processed by `func_1` and their elements added to `flat_list`, or remains an empty list if the original `nested_list` was empty.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list` which contains a flattened version of the original `nested_list`, with all nested lists having been processed by `func_1` and their elements added to `flat_list`, or remains an empty list if the original `nested_list` was empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `nested_list` that may contain integers and/or other lists, which may also be nested, and returns a one-dimensional list containing all elements from the original list, effectively flattening it. The function can handle arbitrary levels of nesting and returns an empty list if the input list is empty. The input list remains unchanged as the function operates on a copy of its elements. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list inputs or non-integer, non-list elements within the input list, so its behavior may be unpredictable in such cases. After the function concludes, the input `nested_list` and its internal state remain unchanged, but the function returns a new list `flat_list` containing the flattened result.
