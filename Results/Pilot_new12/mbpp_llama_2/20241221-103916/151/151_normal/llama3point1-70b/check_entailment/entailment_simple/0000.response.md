Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description of flattening a given nested list structure. Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. **Base Case**: The function handles the base case where an element in the list is not a list (i.e., it's an integer or another type of object). In this case, it simply appends the element to the `flat_list`.

2. **Recursive Case**: When an element in the list is itself a list, the function calls itself recursively with that sublist as the argument. This process continues until all nested lists have been flattened.

3. **Flattening**: The `extend` method is used to add elements from the recursive call to the `flat_list`. This is the key step in flattening the list, as it ensures that elements from nested lists are added to the `flat_list` at the same level as elements from the original list.

4. **Handling Empty Lists**: The function also correctly handles empty lists. If the input list is empty, the `for` loop will not execute, and the function will return an empty list, which is the expected result for an empty input.

Since the function correctly handles all possible cases (base case, recursive case, flattening, and handling empty lists), and it assumes valid input as per the problem description, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
