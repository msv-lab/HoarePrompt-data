Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be a recursive function designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and checks each element in the input list to determine whether it's a list or a single element.

The function works as follows:

- It initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened elements.
- It iterates through each element `i` in the input `nested_list`.
- If `i` is a list (checked using `type(i) == list`), it calls itself recursively with `i` as the new input list and extends `flat_list` with the returned flattened list.
- If `i` is not a list, it appends `i` directly to `flat_list`.
- Finally, it returns the `flat_list`, which contains all elements from the original nested list but in a flattened form.

This approach correctly handles nested lists of any depth and composition. For example, given the input `[[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]], 6]`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the expected flattened version.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases of nested lists (including empty lists, single-element lists, deeply nested lists, and lists containing both numbers and further nested lists), and it follows the problem description accurately, the program is considered correct.
