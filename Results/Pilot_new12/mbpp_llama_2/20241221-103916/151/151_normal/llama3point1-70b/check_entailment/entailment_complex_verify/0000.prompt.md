You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be a recursive function designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and checks each element in the input list to determine whether it's a list or a single element.

The function works as follows:

- It initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened elements.
- It iterates through each element `i` in the input `nested_list`.
- If `i` is a list (checked using `type(i) == list`), it calls itself recursively with `i` as the new input list and extends `flat_list` with the returned flattened list.
- If `i` is not a list, it appends `i` directly to `flat_list`.
- Finally, it returns the `flat_list`, which contains all elements from the original nested list but in a flattened form.

This approach correctly handles nested lists of any depth and composition. For example, given the input `[[1, 2], [3, [4, 5]], 6]`, the function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is the expected flattened version.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases of nested lists (including empty lists, single-element lists, deeply nested lists, and lists containing both numbers and further nested lists), and it follows the problem description accurately, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, which may also be nested.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list that may have been fully or partially traversed depending on its original contents, `i` is the last element of the original `nested_list` if it is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined in this context since the loop wouldn't execute, and `flat_list` contains a flattened version of the original `nested_list`, with all nested lists having been processed by `func_1` and their elements added to `flat_list`, or remains an empty list if the original `nested_list` was empty.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list` which contains a flattened version of the original `nested_list`, with all nested lists having been processed by `func_1` and their elements added to `flat_list`, or remains an empty list if the original `nested_list` was empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `nested_list` that may contain integers and/or other lists, which may also be nested, and returns a one-dimensional list containing all elements from the original list, effectively flattening it. The function can handle arbitrary levels of nesting and returns an empty list if the input list is empty. The input list remains unchanged as the function operates on a copy of its elements. The function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list inputs or non-integer, non-list elements within the input list, so its behavior may be unpredictable in such cases. After the function concludes, the input `nested_list` and its internal state remain unchanged, but the function returns a new list `flat_list` containing the flattened result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
