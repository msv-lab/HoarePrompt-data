Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input, which may contain integers and/or other lists, and returns a one-dimensional list containing all elements from the original list, effectively flattening it.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The function handles arbitrary levels of nesting: The function uses recursion to flatten the nested list. When it encounters a sublist, it calls itself with the sublist as the new input, and extends the `flat_list` with the result.

2. The function returns an empty list if the input list is empty: If the input list is empty, the `for` loop will not execute, and the function will return the `flat_list`, which is initialized as an empty list.

3. The function does not modify the original input list: The function operates on a copy of the input list elements, and returns a new list `flat_list` containing the flattened result. The original input list remains unchanged.

4. The function handles the case when the input list contains integers and/or other lists: The function checks the type of each element in the input list. If the element is a list, it recursively calls itself with the sublist. If the element is not a list (i.e., an integer), it appends the element to the `flat_list`.

Given the assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function correctly flattens the input list according to the problem description.
