Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program successfully flattens a given nested list structure. The function `func_1` recursively iterates over the input list `nested_list`. If an element is a list, it calls itself with this sublist, effectively flattening it. If an element is not a list, it simply appends this element to the `flat_list`. This process continues until all nested lists have been flattened, resulting in a one-dimensional list containing all elements from the original list.

The output hints confirm that the function can handle arbitrary levels of nesting and returns an empty list if the input list is empty, which aligns with the problem description. The function does not modify the input list, operating on a copy of its elements instead, and returns a new list containing the flattened result, as specified.

Given that we assume the input will be valid (i.e., a list that may contain integers and/or other lists), the program is designed to handle all potential cases as described in the problem. There are no indicated edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to produce the expected output based on the description provided. Therefore, the program is considered correct for the specified task of flattening a nested list structure.
