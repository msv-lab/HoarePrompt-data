You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is a recursive function designed to flatten a given nested list structure. It works by iterating over each element in the input list. If an element is itself a list, the function calls itself with that sublist, effectively flattening it, and then extends the main list with the flattened result. If an element is not a list, it simply appends that element to the main list.

This approach correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and structure, including lists containing a mix of simple elements (like integers or strings) and sublists. The recursive nature of the function allows it to traverse the nested structure as needed, flattening it into a one-dimensional list.

For example, given the input `[1, [2, 3], [4, [5, 6]]]`, the function will correctly return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, demonstrating its ability to handle nested lists.

The program handles the base case (when the input list is empty) implicitly, as it will simply return an empty list in such a scenario, which is the correct behavior for flattening an empty list.

Since the function correctly handles all potential cases of nested list structures (including empty lists, lists with no nesting, lists with one level of nesting, lists with multiple levels of nesting, and lists containing a mix of types), and it does not contain any logical errors or omissions that would cause it to fail for any specific input, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, which may also be nested.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nested_list` is a list that may have been fully or partially traversed depending on its original contents, `i` is the last element of the original `nested_list` if it is not empty, otherwise `i` is undefined in this context since the loop wouldn't execute, and `flat_list` contains a flattened version of the original `nested_list`, with all nested lists having been processed by `func_1` and their elements added to `flat_list`, or remains an empty list if the original `nested_list` was empty.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list` which contains a flattened version of the original `nested_list`, with all nested lists having been processed by `func_1` and their elements added to `flat_list`, or remains an empty list if the original `nested_list` was empty.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
