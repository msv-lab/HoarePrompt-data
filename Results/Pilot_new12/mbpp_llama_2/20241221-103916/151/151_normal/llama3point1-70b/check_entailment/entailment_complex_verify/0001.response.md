The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The annotated version of the code confirms the original assessment by detailing the state of the program at different points, which aligns with the expected behavior of the function.

The annotated code describes the state of the program right before the function call, indicating that `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, which may also be nested. This matches the problem description's requirement for the function to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth and structure.

The annotations also describe the state of the program after the for loop has been executed, stating that `flat_list` contains a flattened version of the original `nested_list`, with all nested lists having been processed by `func_1` and their elements added to `flat_list`, or remains an empty list if the original `nested_list` was empty. This confirms that the function correctly handles the base case (when the input list is empty) and returns the expected result.

Furthermore, the annotated code specifies that the function does not perform any error checking or handling for non-list inputs or non-integer, non-list elements within the input list. However, since we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this does not affect the correctness of the program.

Therefore, based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the program is correct. The function correctly flattens a given nested list structure, handles arbitrary levels of nesting, and returns an empty list if the input list is empty, which aligns with the problem description.

Final: **True**
