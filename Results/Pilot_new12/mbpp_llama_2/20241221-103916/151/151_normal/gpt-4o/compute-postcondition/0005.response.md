The code appends the value of `item` to `flat_list`. Since `item` is the first item in `nested_list` and it is not a list (i.e., it is an integer), the value of `item` is appended to `flat_list`. 

Before the execution of the code, `flat_list` was an empty list. After the execution, `flat_list` contains the first item of `nested_list`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `nested_list` still has at least 1 item and may contain integers and/or other lists, and `item` is still the first item in `nested_list` and is an integer.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 1 item and may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list containing the first item of `nested_list`, `item` is the first item in `nested_list` and `item` is an integer**
