The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists. After executing the function body, the function returns `flat_list`, which is a list containing the flattened result of `nested_list`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, and return a flattened list where all nested lists are processed recursively and other items are preserved in their original form.

Functionality: **The function accepts a nested list, returns a flattened list with all nested lists transformed and other items preserved.**
