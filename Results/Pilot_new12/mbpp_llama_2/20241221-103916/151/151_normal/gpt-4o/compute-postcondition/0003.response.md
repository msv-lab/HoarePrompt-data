To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what `func_1(item)` does, but since its implementation is not provided, we will assume it is a function that takes a list as an argument and returns a list.

Given that `item` is a list (the first item in `nested_list`) and `flat_list` is initially an empty list, the operation `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` will extend `flat_list` with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`.

Since we don't know the exact implementation of `func_1`, we can't determine the exact elements that will be added to `flat_list`. However, we know that `item` is a list and `func_1` presumably processes this list in some way, returning a list that is then added to `flat_list`.

The impact on the program is that `flat_list`, which was initially empty, will now contain the elements returned by `func_1(item)`, whatever those may be. The state of `nested_list` and its contents, including `item`, does not change because the operation is on `flat_list` and involves a function call with `item` as an argument, not modifying `item` or `nested_list` directly.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list that must have at least 1 item and may contain integers and/or other lists, `item` is a list and is the first item in `nested_list`, `flat_list` is a list containing the result of `func_1(item)`.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 1 item and may contain integers and/or other lists, `item` is a list and is the first item in `nested_list`, `flat_list` is a list containing the result of `func_1(item)`**
