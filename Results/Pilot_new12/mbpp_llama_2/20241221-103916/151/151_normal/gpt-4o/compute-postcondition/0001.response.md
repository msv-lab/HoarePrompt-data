According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 1 item, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists and `flat_list` is an empty list. This does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nested_list` must have at least 1 item and `item` is now the first item in `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 1 item and may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first item in `nested_list`**
