You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string, 'str' has 3 or more characters
```
eturn str
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns string 'str' that has 3 or more characters **


Example2:
Initial State: `numbers` is an empty list, `total` is the sum of all positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `count` is the number of positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `average` is equal to `total / count`
```
return A
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
Output State: **The program returns average whuih is equal to total/count , where total is the sum of all positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list, `count` is the number of positive integers that were in the original `numbers` list**

Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
return n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer:
The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the program returns either 4 or 6.
Output State: **The program returns 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is 1, `y` is  greater than 3 , `z` is 0
```
retrun y+x
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
`y' is 0 and 'x' is one so the program returns  0+1=1.
Output State: **`The program returns y that is greater than 3 plus 1**

Example4:
Initial State: `count' contains the number of numbers greater than 1 in the list `numbers`, 'numbers' is a list of integers, 'total' is 0
```
retrun count
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer: 
Output State: **`The program returns the number of integers greater than 1 in list 'numbers' **


Your Task:
Initial State: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.

1. **Loop Code Analysis**: The loop iterates over each `item` in `nested_list`. If the `item` is a list, it extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)`. If the `item` is not a list (assuming it's an integer or another type of object), it appends this `item` to `flat_list`.

2. **Initial State**: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, and `flat_list` is an empty list.

3. **Output States After Some Executions**:
   - After executing once, `flat_list` contains either the first item of `nested_list` if it's an integer or the result of `func_1` applied to the first item if it's a list.
   - After executing twice, `flat_list` contains the results of processing the first two items in `nested_list`, which could be integers or lists processed by `func_1`.
   - After executing three times, `flat_list` contains the results of processing the first three items, following the same logic.

4. **Generalizing the Output State**:
   - If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `flat_list` remains an empty list.
   - If `nested_list` contains at least one item, `flat_list` will be populated with the results of processing each item in `nested_list`. 
   - For items that are lists, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`. The exact nature of `func_1` isn't specified, but it's implied to return a list or an iterable that can be extended into `flat_list`.
   - For items that are not lists (e.g., integers), `flat_list` is appended with these items directly.

Given this analysis, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the state of the variables will reflect the complete processing of `nested_list`. If `nested_list` was empty, `flat_list` remains empty. Otherwise, `flat_list` will contain a flattened version of `nested_list`, with any nested lists processed according to `func_1` and non-list items appended directly.

**Output State: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list containing the flattened result of `nested_list` where lists are processed by `func_1` and other items are appended as is.**
```
return flat_list

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate what the program returns. Any variable or value that is included in the return, describe all the information we have for it.
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
