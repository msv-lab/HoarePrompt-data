To calculate the result, we first note that `nested_list` has at least 3 items and may contain integers and/or other lists. The `item` is the third item in `nested_list`, which can be an integer or a list. `flat_list` is a list that may contain the results of `func_1(item)` for list items or the values of integer items.

Given the code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))`, we understand that `func_1(item)` will be applied to the third item of `nested_list`, and the results will be added to `flat_list`.

Since we do not know the specific implementation of `func_1`, we can only describe the impact in general terms. If `item` is an integer, `func_1(item)` will presumably return a value or a list of values based on the integer. If `item` is a list, `func_1(item)` could return a flattened version of the list, a transformed version of the list, or any other result depending on `func_1`'s implementation.

The key point is that `flat_list` will be extended by the result(s) of applying `func_1` to `item`, which is the third element of `nested_list`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list that must have at least 3 items and may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is extended by the results of applying `func_1` to the third item in `nested_list`, and `item` remains the third item in `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 3 items and may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list that contains its original items plus the results of `func_1(item)`, where `item` is the third item in `nested_list`, and `item` is the third item in `nested_list`.**
