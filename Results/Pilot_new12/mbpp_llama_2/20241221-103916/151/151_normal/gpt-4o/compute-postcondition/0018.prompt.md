You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Loop Code Analysis**: The loop iterates over each `item` in `nested_list`. If the `item` is a list, it extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)`. If the `item` is not a list (assuming it's an integer or another type of object), it appends this `item` to `flat_list`.
    #
    #2. **Initial State**: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, and `flat_list` is an empty list.
    #
    #3. **Output States After Some Executions**:
    #   - After executing once, `flat_list` contains either the first item of `nested_list` if it's an integer or the result of `func_1` applied to the first item if it's a list.
    #   - After executing twice, `flat_list` contains the results of processing the first two items in `nested_list`, which could be integers or lists processed by `func_1`.
    #   - After executing three times, `flat_list` contains the results of processing the first three items, following the same logic.
    #
    #4. **Generalizing the Output State**:
    #   - If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `flat_list` remains an empty list.
    #   - If `nested_list` contains at least one item, `flat_list` will be populated with the results of processing each item in `nested_list`. 
    #   - For items that are lists, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`. The exact nature of `func_1` isn't specified, but it's implied to return a list or an iterable that can be extended into `flat_list`.
    #   - For items that are not lists (e.g., integers), `flat_list` is appended with these items directly.
    #
    #Given this analysis, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the state of the variables will reflect the complete processing of `nested_list`. If `nested_list` was empty, `flat_list` remains empty. Otherwise, `flat_list` will contain a flattened version of `nested_list`, with any nested lists processed according to `func_1` and non-list items appended directly.
    #
    #**Output State: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list containing the flattened result of `nested_list` where lists are processed by `func_1` and other items are appended as is.**
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list`, which is a list containing the flattened result of `nested_list` where lists are processed by `func_1` and other items are appended as is, resulting in a single list that contains all the elements from `nested_list`, with any nested lists transformed according to `func_1` and other types of items preserved in their original form.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a nested list, returns a flattened list with all nested lists transformed and other items preserved.

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns `flat_list`, which is a list containing the flattened result of `nested_list` where lists are processed by `func_1` and other items are appended as is, resulting in a single list that contains all the elements from `nested_list`, with any nested lists transformed according to `func_1` and other types of items preserved in their original form.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
