To solve this problem, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.


The initial state provides the following information:
- `nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, containing integers and/or other lists.
- `flat_list` is a list that may contain results of `func_1(item)` for list items or the values of integer items.
- `item` is the second item in `nested_list`.


The code snippet is:
```python
flat_list.append(item)
```


This line of code appends the value of `item` to the end of `flat_list`. Since `item` is defined as the second item in `nested_list`, its value could be either an integer or a list, depending on the composition of `nested_list`.


Given this, the outcome of the code execution is that `flat_list` will now contain one additional element, which is the second item from `nested_list`. The nature of this item (integer or list) depends on `nested_list`'s structure.


The states of `nested_list` and the definition of `item` as the second item in `nested_list` remain unchanged, as the code only modifies `flat_list`.


Therefore, after executing the code, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `nested_list` is a list that must have at least 2 items and may contain integers and/or other lists.
- `flat_list` is a list that may contain the results of `func_1(item)` for list items or the values of integer items, and now also includes the second item from `nested_list`.
- `item` is still the second item in `nested_list`.


Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 2 items and may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list that may contain the results of `func_1(item)` for list items or the values of integer items and includes the second item from `nested_list`, `item` is the second item in `nested_list`**
