To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, containing integers and/or other lists.
- `flat_list` is a list that may contain results of `func_1(item)` for list items or the values of integer items.
- `item` is the third item in `nested_list`.

The code snippet is:
```python
flat_list.append(item)
```

This code appends the `item` (which is the third item in `nested_list`) to the end of `flat_list`.

After executing the code:
- `nested_list` still has at least 3 items and may contain integers and/or other lists. Its state does not change.
- `flat_list` now definitely contains the third item of `nested_list` as its last element, in addition to any elements it may have had before.
- `item` is still the third item in `nested_list`, and its value does not change. It is now also the last element in `flat_list`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, containing integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list containing its previous elements and the third item of `nested_list` as its last element, and `item` is the third item in `nested_list` and the last item in `flat_list`.**
