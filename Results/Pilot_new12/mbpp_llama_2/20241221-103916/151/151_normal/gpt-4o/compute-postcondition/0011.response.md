According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 3 items, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 items and the `item` is the third item in the list.
State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 3 items and may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list that may contain the results of `func_1(item)` for list items or the values of integer items, and `item` is the third item in `nested_list`**
