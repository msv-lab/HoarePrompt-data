To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.

1. **Loop Code Analysis**: The loop iterates over each `item` in `nested_list`. If the `item` is a list, it extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)`. If the `item` is not a list (assuming it's an integer or another type of object), it appends this `item` to `flat_list`.

2. **Initial State**: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, and `flat_list` is an empty list.

3. **Output States After Some Executions**:
   - After executing once, `flat_list` contains either the first item of `nested_list` if it's an integer or the result of `func_1` applied to the first item if it's a list.
   - After executing twice, `flat_list` contains the results of processing the first two items in `nested_list`, which could be integers or lists processed by `func_1`.
   - After executing three times, `flat_list` contains the results of processing the first three items, following the same logic.

4. **Generalizing the Output State**:
   - If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `flat_list` remains an empty list.
   - If `nested_list` contains at least one item, `flat_list` will be populated with the results of processing each item in `nested_list`. 
   - For items that are lists, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`. The exact nature of `func_1` isn't specified, but it's implied to return a list or an iterable that can be extended into `flat_list`.
   - For items that are not lists (e.g., integers), `flat_list` is appended with these items directly.

Given this analysis, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the state of the variables will reflect the complete processing of `nested_list`. If `nested_list` was empty, `flat_list` remains empty. Otherwise, `flat_list` will contain a flattened version of `nested_list`, with any nested lists processed according to `func_1` and non-list items appended directly.

**Output State: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list containing the flattened result of `nested_list` where lists are processed by `func_1` and other items are appended as is.**
