To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop structure.

Given:
- `nested_list` is a list that must have at least 1 item and may contain integers and/or other lists.
- `flat_list` is a list.
- `item` is the first item in `nested_list`.
- If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` contains the result of `func_1(item)`.
- If `item` is an integer, then `flat_list` contains the value of `item`.

The loop is defined as `for item in nested_list:`. This means that for the loop to execute again, `nested_list` must have more than one item since `item` would have been the first item in the previous iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `nested_list` has at least 1 item (since the loop executed at least once).
- `item` is the first item in `nested_list`.
- Depending on the type of `item`, `flat_list` has been updated accordingly.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `nested_list` must have at least 2 items (since the first item has already been processed).
- `item` must now be the second item in `nested_list`.
- The state of `flat_list` depends on the new `item`. If the new `item` is a list, it would contain the result of `func_1(item)`; if it's an integer, it would contain the value of the new `item`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 2 items and may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list that may contain the results of `func_1(item)` for list items or the values of integer items, `item` is the second item in `nested_list`**
