Postcondition: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 2 items and may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list that may contain the results of `func_1(item)` for list items or the values of integer items, and `item` is the second item in `nested_list`. If the second item in `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` has been extended with the result of `func_1(item)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` includes the second item from `nested_list`.**
