Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 3 items and may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list, and `item` is the third item in `nested_list`. If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` contains its original items plus the results of `func_1(item)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains its previous elements and the third item of `nested_list` as its last element, and `item` is also the last item in `flat_list`.***
