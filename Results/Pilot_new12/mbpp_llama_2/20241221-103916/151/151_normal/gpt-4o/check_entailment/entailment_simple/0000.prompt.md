You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]
assert func_1([[10, 20], [40], [30, 56, 25], [10, 20], [33], [40]]) == [10, 20, 40, 30, 56, 25, 10, 20, 33, 40]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Loop Code Analysis**: The loop iterates over each `item` in `nested_list`. If the `item` is a list, it extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)`. If the `item` is not a list (assuming it's an integer or another type of object), it appends this `item` to `flat_list`.
    #
    #2. **Initial State**: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, and `flat_list` is an empty list.
    #
    #3. **Output States After Some Executions**:
    #   - After executing once, `flat_list` contains either the first item of `nested_list` if it's an integer or the result of `func_1` applied to the first item if it's a list.
    #   - After executing twice, `flat_list` contains the results of processing the first two items in `nested_list`, which could be integers or lists processed by `func_1`.
    #   - After executing three times, `flat_list` contains the results of processing the first three items, following the same logic.
    #
    #4. **Generalizing the Output State**:
    #   - If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `flat_list` remains an empty list.
    #   - If `nested_list` contains at least one item, `flat_list` will be populated with the results of processing each item in `nested_list`. 
    #   - For items that are lists, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`. The exact nature of `func_1` isn't specified, but it's implied to return a list or an iterable that can be extended into `flat_list`.
    #   - For items that are not lists (e.g., integers), `flat_list` is appended with these items directly.
    #
    #Given this analysis, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the state of the variables will reflect the complete processing of `nested_list`. If `nested_list` was empty, `flat_list` remains empty. Otherwise, `flat_list` will contain a flattened version of `nested_list`, with any nested lists processed according to `func_1` and non-list items appended directly.
    #
    #**Output State: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists, `flat_list` is a list containing the flattened result of `nested_list` where lists are processed by `func_1` and other items are appended as is.**
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list`, which is a list containing the flattened result of `nested_list` where lists are processed by `func_1` and other items are appended as is, resulting in a single list that contains all the elements from `nested_list`, with any nested lists transformed according to `func_1` and other types of items preserved in their original form.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
