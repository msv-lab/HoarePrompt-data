Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. 

Here's why the program works as expected:

1. **Recursion**: The function `func_1` uses recursion to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth. When it encounters a list item, it calls itself with that list item, effectively flattening the nested structure.

2. **Base Case**: The base case for the recursion is when the function encounters an item that is not a list (assumed to be an integer based on the context). In this case, it simply appends the item to the `flat_list`.

3. **Iteration**: The function iterates over each item in the input `nested_list`, processing each item according to whether it's a list or not. This ensures that every item in the original list and its nested lists is processed.

4. **Flattening**: By extending `flat_list` with the result of recursive calls to `func_1` for list items and appending non-list items directly, the function effectively flattens the input structure into a one-dimensional list.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns `flat_list`, which contains the flattened result of the input `nested_list`, meeting the requirement of the problem description.

Given the provided assertions and the logic of the function, it's clear that the program correctly handles various scenarios of nested lists, including lists with multiple levels of nesting and lists containing both integers and other lists. 

Therefore, the program does what the problem description asks for in every potential case, assuming valid input (i.e., the input is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists).
