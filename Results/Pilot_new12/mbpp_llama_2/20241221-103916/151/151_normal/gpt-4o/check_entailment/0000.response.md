Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program is designed to flatten a nested list structure, and upon review, it appears to be correct for every potential case. The program uses recursion to traverse the nested list, and it properly handles both nested lists and individual elements.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works:

* The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input and initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened elements.
* It then iterates over each `item` in the `nested_list`.
* If the `item` is a list (checked using `isinstance(item, list)`), it recursively calls `func_1` on that `item` and extends the `flat_list` with the returned flattened list.
* If the `item` is not a list, it simply appends the `item` to the `flat_list`.
* Finally, the function returns the `flat_list`, which contains the flattened elements from the original nested list.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the program's correctness for various nested list structures. Additionally, the recursive approach used in the program allows it to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth.

Since I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
