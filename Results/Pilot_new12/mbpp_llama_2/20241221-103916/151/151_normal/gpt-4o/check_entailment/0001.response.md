Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct. It uses a recursive approach to flatten a nested list structure. The function `func_1` checks each item in the input list to see if it is a list itself. If it is, the function calls itself with that sublist, effectively flattening it, and then adds the elements of the flattened sublist to the `flat_list`. If the item is not a list, it simply appends the item to the `flat_list`.

The provided unit tests cover various cases, including nested lists with different levels of nesting and single-element lists. Upon examining the code, it seems to correctly handle all potential cases, including:

- Nested lists of varying depths
- Lists containing a mix of integers and other lists
- Single-element lists
- Empty lists (although an empty list is not explicitly tested, the function should return an empty list, which is the expected behavior)

Since the function correctly handles recursion for nested lists of any depth and the unit tests provided cover a range of scenarios without revealing any inconsistencies or failures, the program is considered correct. It correctly implements the requirement to flatten a given nested list structure.
