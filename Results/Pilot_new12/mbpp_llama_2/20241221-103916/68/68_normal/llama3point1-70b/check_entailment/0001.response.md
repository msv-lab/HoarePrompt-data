Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns its angle. The `cmath.phase` function is used to calculate this angle.

The program is correct because it handles all potential cases as described in the problem. The `cmath.phase` function is designed to work with complex numbers, and it correctly calculates the angle of a complex number in radians. 

Here are a few examples that demonstrate the correctness of the program:
- For a complex number with non-zero real and imaginary parts, the program correctly calculates the angle. For instance, `func_1(3, 4)` returns the angle of the complex number `3 + 4j`.
- For a complex number with zero imaginary part, the program returns `0` (or `2 * pi` if the real part is negative), which is the correct angle for a real number.
- For a complex number with zero real part, the program returns `pi / 2` (or `-pi / 2` if the imaginary part is negative), which is the correct angle for an imaginary number.

In all cases, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
