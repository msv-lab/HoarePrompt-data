You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the angle of a complex number. The angle of a complex number is also known as its phase or argument, and it's the counterclockwise angle between the positive real axis and the line segment joining the origin to the complex number in the complex plane.

Here are a few reasons why I think the code is correct:
1. The `cmath.phase` function is specifically designed to calculate the phase (angle) of a complex number, which matches the problem description.
2. The `complex` function is used to create a complex number from its real and imaginary parts, which is a standard way to represent complex numbers in Python.
3. There are no apparent edge cases that the code does not handle. For example, the `cmath.phase` function can handle complex numbers with zero real or imaginary part, as well as complex numbers with negative real or imaginary part.
4. The code does not perform any operations that could potentially lead to incorrect results, such as integer overflows or division by zero.

To test the code, you could try it with a few examples:
- `func_1(3, 4)` should return approximately 0.927 (since the angle of 3+4j is arctan(4/3))
- `func_1(0, 1)` should return approximately 1.5708 (since the angle of 1j is pi/2)
- `func_1(-1, 0)` should return approximately 3.1416 (since the angle of -1 is pi)

In all of these cases, the code produces the expected result. Since I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work correctly, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import cmath

#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are real numbers.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase angle in radians of the complex number `real + imag*1j`, which is a real number between -pi and pi, inclusive, representing the angle from the positive real axis to the complex number in the complex plane.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
