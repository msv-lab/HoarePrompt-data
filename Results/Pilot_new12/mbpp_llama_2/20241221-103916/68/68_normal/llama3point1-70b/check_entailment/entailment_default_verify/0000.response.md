The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function, which is the standard way to calculate the phase angle in Python.

The output hints provided also support the correctness of the program. They accurately describe the functionality of the `func_1` function, including its input parameters, return value, and handling of different cases for the real and imaginary parts of the complex number.

Upon reviewing the code and output hints, I did not find any evidence that suggests the program does not meet the problem description. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the phase angle in radians of a complex number formed by two real numbers, and it handles all possible cases where the real and imaginary parts can be any real numbers.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
