You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns its angle. The `cmath.phase` function is used to calculate this angle.

The program is correct because it handles all potential cases as described in the problem. The `cmath.phase` function is designed to work with complex numbers, and it correctly calculates the angle of a complex number in radians. 

Here are a few examples that demonstrate the correctness of the program:
- For a complex number with non-zero real and imaginary parts, the program correctly calculates the angle. For instance, `func_1(3, 4)` returns the angle of the complex number `3 + 4j`.
- For a complex number with zero imaginary part, the program returns `0` (or `2 * pi` if the real part is negative), which is the correct angle for a real number.
- For a complex number with zero real part, the program returns `pi / 2` (or `-pi / 2` if the imaginary part is negative), which is the correct angle for an imaginary number.

In all cases, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import cmath

#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are real numbers.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase angle in radians of the complex number `real + imag*1j`, which is a real number between -pi and pi, inclusive, representing the angle from the positive real axis to the complex number in the complex plane.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function computes and returns the phase angle in radians of a complex number formed by two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. It takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, and returns a single real number between -pi and pi, inclusive, representing the angle from the positive real axis to the complex number in the complex plane. The function handles all possible cases where `real` and `imag` can be any real numbers, including zero, positive, and negative values, and correctly calculates the phase angle for complex numbers in all four quadrants. The final state of the program after execution is the return of this phase angle, which can be used for further processing or analysis.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
