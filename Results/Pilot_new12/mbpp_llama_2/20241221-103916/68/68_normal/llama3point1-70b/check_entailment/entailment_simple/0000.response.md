Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem asks to write a function to get the angle of a complex number. The provided function `func_1(real, imag)` does exactly this by using the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the phase angle in radians of the complex number `real + imag*1j`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. It takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
2. It creates a complex number using the `complex()` function with the provided `real` and `imag` values.
3. It returns the phase angle of the complex number using `cmath.phase()`, which is a real number between -pi and pi, inclusive, representing the angle from the positive real axis to the complex number in the complex plane.

Since the program correctly calculates and returns the angle of a complex number, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
