Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements a function to get the angle of a complex number. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase angle of the complex number in radians.

The `cmath.phase` function returns the phase angle of a complex number, which is the angle from the positive real axis to the complex number in the complex plane. This angle is measured in radians and is in the range of -pi to pi, inclusive.

The function handles all possible cases where `real` and `imag` can be any real numbers, including zero, positive, and negative values, and correctly calculates the phase angle for complex numbers in all four quadrants.

The output hints provided also agree with the code's functionality. They mention that the function computes and returns the phase angle in radians of a complex number formed by two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, and that it handles all possible cases where `real` and `imag` can be any real numbers.

Since the code correctly implements the required functionality and handles all possible cases as described in the problem description and output hints, it is correct for every potential case.
