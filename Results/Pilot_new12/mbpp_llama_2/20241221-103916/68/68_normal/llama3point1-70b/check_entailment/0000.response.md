Correctness: **True**.

The given program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the angle of a complex number. The angle of a complex number is also known as its phase or argument, and it's the counterclockwise angle between the positive real axis and the line segment joining the origin to the complex number in the complex plane.

Here are a few reasons why I think the code is correct:
1. The `cmath.phase` function is specifically designed to calculate the phase (angle) of a complex number, which matches the problem description.
2. The `complex` function is used to create a complex number from its real and imaginary parts, which is a standard way to represent complex numbers in Python.
3. There are no apparent edge cases that the code does not handle. For example, the `cmath.phase` function can handle complex numbers with zero real or imaginary part, as well as complex numbers with negative real or imaginary part.
4. The code does not perform any operations that could potentially lead to incorrect results, such as integer overflows or division by zero.

To test the code, you could try it with a few examples:
- `func_1(3, 4)` should return approximately 0.927 (since the angle of 3+4j is arctan(4/3))
- `func_1(0, 1)` should return approximately 1.5708 (since the angle of 1j is pi/2)
- `func_1(-1, 0)` should return approximately 3.1416 (since the angle of -1 is pi)

In all of these cases, the code produces the expected result. Since I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work correctly, I conclude that the program is correct.
