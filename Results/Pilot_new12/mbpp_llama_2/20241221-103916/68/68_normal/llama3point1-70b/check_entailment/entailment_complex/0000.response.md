Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two real numbers `real` and `imag` as input, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: It creates a complex number from these inputs using the `complex(real, imag)` function.

3. **Phase Angle Calculation**: The program uses the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the phase angle in radians of the complex number. This phase angle represents the angle from the positive real axis to the complex number in the complex plane.

4. **Return Value**: The calculated phase angle is returned by the function. The phase angle is a real number between -π and π, inclusive, which aligns with the problem description.

5. **Handling of Input Values**: Although the problem doesn't explicitly mention error handling for invalid inputs, it is assumed that the input will be valid and won't cause any errors. Therefore, under the assumption of valid inputs (real numbers for `real` and `imag`), the program correctly computes and returns the phase angle for all possible cases, including complex numbers in all four quadrants.

6. **Adherence to Problem Description**: The program does what the problem description asks for: it calculates and returns the angle (phase angle) of a complex number formed by two real numbers, making it a correct implementation according to the given problem description. 

In summary, given the assumptions about valid input and the functionality described, the program is correct because it accurately calculates and returns the phase angle of a complex number as per the requirements outlined in the problem description.
