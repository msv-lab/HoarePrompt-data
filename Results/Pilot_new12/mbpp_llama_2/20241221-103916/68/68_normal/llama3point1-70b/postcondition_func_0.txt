This function computes and returns the phase angle in radians of a complex number formed by two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts, respectively. It takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, and returns a single real number between -pi and pi, inclusive, representing the angle from the positive real axis to the complex number in the complex plane. The function handles all possible cases where `real` and `imag` can be any real numbers, including zero, positive, and negative values, and correctly calculates the phase angle for complex numbers in all four quadrants. The final state of the program after execution is the return of this phase angle, which can be used for further processing or analysis.
