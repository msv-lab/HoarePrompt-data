To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the code snippet.

Given:
- `real` and `imag` are real numbers.
- `complex_num` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*1j`.

The code snippet is:
```python
return cmath.phase(complex_num)
```

This code calculates and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `complex_num`. The phase is calculated in radians and is in the range (-pi, pi].

Since `complex_num = real + imag*1j`, the phase (or angle) of this complex number can be understood in terms of its position on the complex plane, where `real` is the x-coordinate and `imag` is the y-coordinate.

The `cmath.phase()` function returns the counterclockwise angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the segment joining the origin to the complex number.

Given that `real` and `imag` are real numbers, the phase returned by `cmath.phase(complex_num)` will be an angle in radians, reflecting the position of `complex_num` relative to the positive real axis in the complex plane.

Therefore, without specific values for `real` and `imag`, we can say the program returns an angle in radians, which represents the phase of the complex number formed by `real` and `imag`.

Output State: **The program returns the phase angle in radians of the complex number `real + imag*1j`, which is a real number between -pi and pi, inclusive, representing the angle from the positive real axis to the complex number in the complex plane.**
