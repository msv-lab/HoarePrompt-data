The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, both of which are real numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns the phase angle in radians of the complex number formed by `real` and `imag`, which is a real number between -pi and pi, inclusive. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are real numbers, and returns the phase angle in radians of the complex number `real + imag*1j`.**
