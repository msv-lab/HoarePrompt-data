The code creates a new complex number `complex_num` using the `complex` function, which takes two arguments: `real` and `imag`. The `complex` function returns a complex number in the form `a + bj`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part.

Output State: **`real` and `imag` are real numbers, `complex_num` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*1j`**
