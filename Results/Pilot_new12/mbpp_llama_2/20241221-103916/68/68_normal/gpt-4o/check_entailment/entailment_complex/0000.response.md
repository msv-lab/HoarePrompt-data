Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `real + imag*1j`. 

The `cmath.phase` function in Python is used to calculate the phase (or angle) of a complex number, which exactly matches the problem description's requirement. The function correctly handles the case where the complex number is zero (i.e., both `real` and `imag` are zero), in which case it returns `0` as the phase is undefined but `cmath.phase` returns `0` for this case.

The provided unit tests also validate the function's behavior for different inputs, which further confirms that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. 

Therefore, the program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality as described in the problem description.
