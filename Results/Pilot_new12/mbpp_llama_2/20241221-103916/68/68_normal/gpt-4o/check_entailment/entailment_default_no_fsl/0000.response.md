Correctness: **True**

The provided code is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input, creates a complex number from these parts, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number using the `cmath.phase` function.

The function correctly handles the case where the complex number is zero, returning 0 as the phase, which aligns with the behavior of `cmath.phase`. The output is a floating-point number representing the phase in radians within the range `[-pi, pi]`.

Given the assumptions that the input will be valid (i.e., the inputs `real` and `imag` are numbers), the function operates as expected without needing additional error checking for non-numeric inputs. The assertions provided also demonstrate the function's correctness for various complex numbers.

The hints provided in the output description accurately reflect the function's behavior, including its handling of zero and non-zero complex numbers, and the format of its output. Therefore, based on the problem description and the code's functionality, the program is correct for every potential case under the assumption of valid input.
