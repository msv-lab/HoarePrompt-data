Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the angle of a complex number. The function takes the real and imaginary parts of the complex number as input and returns the phase angle of the complex number.

The `cmath.phase` function in Python returns the counterclockwise angle in radians from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number. This aligns with the mathematical definition of the angle of a complex number, which is the angle it makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane.

The unit tests provided also validate the correctness of the function. They check the function's output for different complex numbers and verify that the results are within the expected ranges.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I couldn't find any scenario where the function does not work as expected. The function correctly handles complex numbers with both positive and negative real and imaginary parts. The use of the `cmath.phase` function ensures that the function can handle all possible cases, including complex numbers with zero real or imaginary parts.

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided code, I conclude that the program is correct.
