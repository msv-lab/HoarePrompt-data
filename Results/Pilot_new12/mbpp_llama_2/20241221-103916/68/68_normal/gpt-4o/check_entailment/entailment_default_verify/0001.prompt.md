You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the angle of a complex number. The function takes the real and imaginary parts of the complex number as input and returns the phase angle of the complex number.

The `cmath.phase` function in Python returns the counterclockwise angle in radians from the positive real axis to the segment joining the origin to the complex number. This aligns with the mathematical definition of the angle of a complex number, which is the angle it makes with the positive real axis in the complex plane.

The unit tests provided also validate the correctness of the function. They check the function's output for different complex numbers and verify that the results are within the expected ranges.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, I couldn't find any scenario where the function does not work as expected. The function correctly handles complex numbers with both positive and negative real and imaginary parts. The use of the `cmath.phase` function ensures that the function can handle all possible cases, including complex numbers with zero real or imaginary parts.

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided code, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `real + imag*1j`. The function does not modify the input parameters `real` and `imag`. It correctly handles the case where the complex number is zero (i.e., both `real` and `imag` are zero), in which case it returns `0` as the phase is undefined but `cmath.phase` returns `0` for this case. The function assumes that the inputs `real` and `imag` are numbers and does not perform any error checking on the input types. If the inputs are not numbers, the function may raise a `TypeError`. The function's output is a single floating-point number representing the phase of the complex number in radians, in the range `[-pi, pi]`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
