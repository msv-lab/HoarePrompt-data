Correctness: **True**

The code does what the problem description says for every potential case. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. It uses the `cmath.phase` function to calculate the phase, which returns the angle in radians in the range `[-pi, pi]`.

The function handles the case where the complex number is zero (i.e., both `real` and `imag` are zero) by returning `0`, which is the expected result since `cmath.phase` returns `0` for this case.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of the function's behavior for different inputs. The function's assumptions about the input types (numbers) are also reasonable, given the problem description.

Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input is not a number or is invalid in some other way. Therefore, based on the code and output hints, it appears that the function is correct and works as expected for all valid inputs.
