Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The program defines a function `func_1` that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input, creates a complex number using these parts, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number using the `cmath.phase` function.

The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number, which is exactly what `func_1` does. The program assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., the inputs will be numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. 

The provided unit tests using `assert` statements also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. The `math.isclose` function is used to compare the results of the function with the expected values, allowing for a small relative tolerance due to floating-point precision issues.

Since the program correctly implements the function to get the angle of a complex number as specified in the problem description, it is considered correct. The program does not need to handle invalid inputs or edge cases because the problem statement assumes that the input will always be valid.
