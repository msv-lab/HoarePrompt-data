You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 1j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(2, 1j), 0.4636476090008061, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(0, 2j), 1.5707963267948966, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program provided seems to correctly calculate the angle of a complex number. The `cmath.phase` function in Python returns the phase of a complex number, which is equivalent to the angle of the complex number in the complex plane. 

In the provided unit tests, the function `func_1` correctly returns the angle of complex numbers with varying real and imaginary parts. 

For example, the complex number `0 + 1j` has an angle of `Ï€/2` radians or 1.5707963267948966 degrees, which matches the first unit test. Similarly, the complex number `2 + 1j` has an angle of approximately 0.4636476090008061 radians, which matches the second unit test.

I have tried to think of potential edge cases where the program may fail, such as:

- Complex numbers with zero real and imaginary parts (i.e., `0 + 0j`). In this case, `cmath.phase` returns `0.0`, which is a reasonable result.
- Complex numbers with very large real or imaginary parts. In this case, `cmath.phase` returns the correct angle, as the angle of a complex number only depends on the ratio of its real and imaginary parts, not their absolute values.
- Complex numbers with negative real or imaginary parts. In this case, `cmath.phase` returns the correct angle, taking into account the quadrant of the complex number.

In all of these cases, the program seems to work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `real + imag*1j`. The function does not modify the input parameters `real` and `imag`. It correctly handles the case where the complex number is zero (i.e., both `real` and `imag` are zero), in which case it returns `0` as the phase is undefined but `cmath.phase` returns `0` for this case. The function assumes that the inputs `real` and `imag` are numbers and does not perform any error checking on the input types. If the inputs are not numbers, the function may raise a `TypeError`. The function's output is a single floating-point number representing the phase of the complex number in radians, in the range `[-pi, pi]`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
