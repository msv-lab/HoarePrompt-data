Correctness: **True**.

The program provided seems to correctly calculate the angle of a complex number. The `cmath.phase` function in Python returns the phase of a complex number, which is equivalent to the angle of the complex number in the complex plane. 

In the provided unit tests, the function `func_1` correctly returns the angle of complex numbers with varying real and imaginary parts. 

For example, the complex number `0 + 1j` has an angle of `Ï€/2` radians or 1.5707963267948966 degrees, which matches the first unit test. Similarly, the complex number `2 + 1j` has an angle of approximately 0.4636476090008061 radians, which matches the second unit test.

I have tried to think of potential edge cases where the program may fail, such as:

- Complex numbers with zero real and imaginary parts (i.e., `0 + 0j`). In this case, `cmath.phase` returns `0.0`, which is a reasonable result.
- Complex numbers with very large real or imaginary parts. In this case, `cmath.phase` returns the correct angle, as the angle of a complex number only depends on the ratio of its real and imaginary parts, not their absolute values.
- Complex numbers with negative real or imaginary parts. In this case, `cmath.phase` returns the correct angle, taking into account the quadrant of the complex number.

In all of these cases, the program seems to work correctly. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
