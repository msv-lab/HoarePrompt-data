The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. After executing the function body, the function returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `real + imag*1j`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, real and imag, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number.**
