The code creates a complex number using the `complex()` function, with `real` and `imag` as its real and imaginary parts, respectively. 

`complex_number` is assigned the value of the complex number formed by `real` and `imag`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `real` and `imag` are numbers, `complex_number` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*1j`.

Output State: **`real` and `imag` are numbers, `complex_number` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*1j`**
