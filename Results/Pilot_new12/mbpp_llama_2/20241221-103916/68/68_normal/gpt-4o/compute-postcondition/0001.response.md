To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

The initial state provides us with:
- `real` and `imag` are numbers.
- `complex_number` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*1j`.

The code snippet is:
```python
return cmath.phase(complex_number)
```

This code calculates and returns the phase (angle) of the `complex_number` in radians. The `cmath.phase()` function returns the counterclockwise angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point represented by the complex number on the complex plane.

Given that `complex_number = real + imag*1j`, the phase of this complex number can be understood in terms of its real and imaginary components. The phase (or angle) is essentially the arctangent of the imaginary part divided by the real part, considering the quadrant in which the complex number lies.

Therefore, the output of `cmath.phase(complex_number)` will be an angle in radians, representing the direction of the complex number from the positive real axis on the complex plane.

Output State: **The program returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `real + imag*1j`**
