#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are numbers, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `real + imag*1j`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `real + imag*1j`. The function does not modify the input parameters `real` and `imag`. It correctly handles the case where the complex number is zero (i.e., both `real` and `imag` are zero), in which case it returns `0` as the phase is undefined but `cmath.phase` returns `0` for this case. The function assumes that the inputs `real` and `imag` are numbers and does not perform any error checking on the input types. If the inputs are not numbers, the function may raise a `TypeError`. The function's output is a single floating-point number representing the phase of the complex number in radians, in the range `[-pi, pi]`.
