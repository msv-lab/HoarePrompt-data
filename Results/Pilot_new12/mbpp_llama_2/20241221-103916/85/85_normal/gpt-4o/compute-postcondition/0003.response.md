The program returns `max_diff` which is equal to `max_val - min_val`. We know that `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr` and `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`. Since `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `max_val` and `min_val` will always be integers. The difference between `max_val` and `min_val` will also be an integer.

Output State: **The program returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `arr`.**
