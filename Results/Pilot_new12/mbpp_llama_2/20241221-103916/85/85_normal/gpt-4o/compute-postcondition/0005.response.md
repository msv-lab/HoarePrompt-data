Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers with at least two elements and returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list. It does not modify the input list. The function handles lists with duplicate minimum or maximum values correctly, as well as lists with a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers. If the input list has less than two elements, the function will raise an error when trying to find the minimum or maximum value, since the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions in Python will return the single element in a list with one element, but will raise a ValueError for an empty list. The function does not check for non-integer values in the list, so if the list contains non-integer values, the function may raise a TypeError when trying to calculate the difference between the minimum and maximum values.**
