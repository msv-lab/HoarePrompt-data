The code `max_val = max(arr)` assigns the value of the maximum integer in `arr` to `max_val`. The initial state of `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, and `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`. 

Since `max_val` is assigned the maximum value from `arr`, and `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`, both `min_val` and `max_val` are integers and are elements of `arr`. The states of `arr` and `min_val` are not changed by this code.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`**
