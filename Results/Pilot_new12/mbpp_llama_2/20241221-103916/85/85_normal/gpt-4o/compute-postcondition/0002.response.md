The code `max_diff = max_val - min_val` assigns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `arr` to the variable `max_diff`. The value of `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `min_val` is the smallest integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the largest integer in `arr`, `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`**
