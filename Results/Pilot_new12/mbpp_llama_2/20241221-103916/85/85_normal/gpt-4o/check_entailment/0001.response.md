Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The program uses the built-in `min` and `max` functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the array, and then calculates the maximum difference by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.

The program handles all potential cases correctly. For example:

* If the array contains only one element, the maximum difference is 0, which is correctly calculated by the program.
* If the array contains multiple elements, the program correctly finds the maximum and minimum values and calculates the maximum difference.
* If the array contains duplicate elements, the program correctly finds the maximum and minimum values and calculates the maximum difference.
* If the array contains negative numbers, the program correctly finds the maximum and minimum values and calculates the maximum difference.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program. The program passes all the unit tests, indicating that it works correctly for the given inputs.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It handles all potential cases correctly and passes all the unit tests.
