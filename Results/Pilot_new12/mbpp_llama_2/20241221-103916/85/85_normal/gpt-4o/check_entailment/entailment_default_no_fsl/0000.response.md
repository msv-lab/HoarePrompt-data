Correctness: **True**

The provided code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then subtracting the minimum from the maximum. This approach ensures that the function handles all possible cases correctly, including lists with duplicate minimum or maximum values, as well as lists with a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers.

The code also handles cases where the input array has at least two elements, as required by the problem description. The use of built-in `min()` and `max()` functions in Python ensures that the function can handle arrays with any combination of integers.

The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, and the provided examples demonstrate that the function works as expected. Since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we do not need to consider cases where the input array is empty or contains non-integer values.

Overall, the code is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid input arrays with at least two elements.
