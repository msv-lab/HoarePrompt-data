Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided Python function `func_1` calculates this maximum difference by first finding the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min` and `max` functions. It then calculates the difference between these two values and returns it.

The function will always return the correct result because the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array will always be the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array. This is because the maximum value is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to any other value in the array, and the minimum value is guaranteed to be less than or equal to any other value in the array.

For example, in the array `[2, 1, 5, 3]`, the maximum value is `5` and the minimum value is `1`. The difference between these two values is `4`, which is indeed the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array (e.g., `5 - 1 = 4`, `5 - 2 = 3`, `5 - 3 = 2`, etc.). 

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for different input cases. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements in the problem description.
