Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then subtracting the minimum from the maximum. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for all possible cases.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function handles lists with duplicate minimum or maximum values correctly, as well as lists with a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness:

* `assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4`: The maximum difference between any two elements in the array `(2, 1, 5, 3)` is indeed `5 - 1 = 4`.
* `assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8`: The maximum difference between any two elements in the array `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)` is indeed `9 - 1 = 8`.
* `assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2`: The maximum difference between any two elements in the array `(3, 2, 1)` is indeed `3 - 1 = 2`.

Since the function works correctly for these test cases and the output hints agree with the code, it is reasonable to conclude that the function is correct for all potential cases.
