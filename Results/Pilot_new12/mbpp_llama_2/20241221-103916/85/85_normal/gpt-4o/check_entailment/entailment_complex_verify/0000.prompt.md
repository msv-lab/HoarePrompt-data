You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly calculate the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It achieves this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min` and `max` functions, and then subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.

The function works correctly for all potential cases, including arrays with positive and negative numbers, as well as arrays with duplicate elements. The unit tests provided in the problem description demonstrate the function's correctness for several example inputs.

One key aspect of the function's correctness is that it has a time complexity of O(n) due to the `min` and `max` functions, which makes it efficient for large input arrays. Additionally, the function's logic is straightforward and easy to understand, which reduces the likelihood of errors or edge cases being overlooked.

Overall, since the function correctly implements the required logic and handles all potential cases, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers with at least two elements and returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list. It does not modify the input list. The function handles lists with duplicate minimum or maximum values correctly, as well as lists with a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers. If the input list has less than two elements, the function will raise an error when trying to find the minimum or maximum value, since the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions in Python will return the single element in a list with one element, but will raise a ValueError for an empty list. The function does not check for non-integer values in the list, so if the list contains non-integer values, the function may raise a TypeError when trying to calculate the difference between the minimum and maximum values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
