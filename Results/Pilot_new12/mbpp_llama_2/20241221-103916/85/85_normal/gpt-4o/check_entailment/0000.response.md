Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly calculate the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It achieves this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min` and `max` functions, and then subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.

The function works correctly for all potential cases, including arrays with positive and negative numbers, as well as arrays with duplicate elements. The unit tests provided in the problem description demonstrate the function's correctness for several example inputs.

One key aspect of the function's correctness is that it has a time complexity of O(n) due to the `min` and `max` functions, which makes it efficient for large input arrays. Additionally, the function's logic is straightforward and easy to understand, which reduces the likelihood of errors or edge cases being overlooked.

Overall, since the function correctly implements the required logic and handles all potential cases, it is considered correct.
