Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I have evaluated the program's behavior and reasoning.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, and I agree with this assessment. The provided Python function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min` and `max` functions, and then subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.

The output hints confirm that the function handles lists with duplicate minimum or maximum values correctly, as well as lists with a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers. Although the function does not check for non-integer values in the list, this is not a requirement specified in the problem description, and we assume that the input will be valid.

The only potential issue mentioned in the output hints is that the function will raise an error if the input list has less than two elements. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this is not a concern.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
