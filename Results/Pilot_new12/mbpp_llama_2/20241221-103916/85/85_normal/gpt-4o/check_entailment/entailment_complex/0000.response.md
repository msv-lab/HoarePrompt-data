Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided function, `func_1`, does exactly that. 

It first finds the minimum and maximum values in the array using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions. Then, it calculates the difference between these two values and returns this difference. 

This approach ensures that the function will always return the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, because the difference between the maximum and minimum values will always be the largest possible difference.

For example, given the array `[2, 1, 5, 3]`, the function will correctly return `4`, which is the difference between the maximum value `5` and the minimum value `1`.

The function handles lists with duplicate minimum or maximum values correctly, as well as lists with a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers. This is because the `min()` and `max()` functions will always return the smallest and largest values, respectively, regardless of whether there are duplicates or what the sign of the numbers is. 

In summary, the function always does what the problem description says, and it does so for every potential case, assuming the input is a valid list of integers with at least two elements.
