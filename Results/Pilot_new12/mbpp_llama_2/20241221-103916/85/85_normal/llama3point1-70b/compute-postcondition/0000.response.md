To calculate the output state, we need to consider the initial state and the given Python code snippet. 

The initial state is that `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements.

The code snippet is `return max(arr) - min(arr)`.

Given this information, `max(arr)` will return the maximum integer value in the list `arr`, and `min(arr)` will return the minimum integer value in the list `arr`. 

The program then returns the difference between these two values, which represents the range of the integers in the list `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list `arr`.**
