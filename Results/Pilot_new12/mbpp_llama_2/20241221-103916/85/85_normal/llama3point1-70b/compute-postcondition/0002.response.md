Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list. This implies that the function performs a comparison of all elements in the list to determine the minimum and maximum values, and then calculates their difference. The function does not modify the input list and does not handle potential edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element, as these scenarios would result in errors when attempting to find the minimum and maximum values. Additionally, the function assumes that the input list contains only integers, and does not account for potential errors that may occur if the list contains non-integer values. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that the input list remains unchanged, and the calculated difference between the maximum and minimum integer values is returned as the result.**
