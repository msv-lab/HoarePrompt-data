Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively, and then returns the difference between these two values.

This approach is correct because the maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. The `max` and `min` functions will correctly identify these values, even if the array contains duplicate values, negative numbers, or zero.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 5, 3, 9, 2]`, the function will correctly return `8`, which is the difference between the maximum value `9` and the minimum value `1`. Similarly, if the input array is `[-5, 0, 5]`, the function will correctly return `10`, which is the difference between the maximum value `5` and the minimum value `-5`.

In all cases, the function will correctly calculate the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, making the program correct according to the problem description.
