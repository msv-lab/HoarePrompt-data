Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does this by first finding the maximum and minimum values in the array using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions, and then subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. This approach will always yield the correct result for any valid input.

The output hints suggest that the function does not handle edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element. However, as per the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, we can consider the code to be correct as long as it works correctly for valid inputs.

Since the function is designed to find the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list, and it does so correctly for all valid inputs, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Note: If the input was supposed to handle invalid cases, the code would be incorrect because it doesn't include any error checking or handling for such cases. However, given the problem statement's assumption of valid input, the code is considered correct.
