The problem description requires the function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. This means that we need to compare each pair of elements in the array and find the maximum difference among them.

The given program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum element in the array, which is equivalent to finding the maximum difference between any two elements. The reason for this equivalence is that the maximum difference between any two elements will always occur between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program finds the maximum element in the array using the `max()` function, which guarantees that this element is the largest among all elements in the array.
2. The program finds the minimum element in the array using the `min()` function, which guarantees that this element is the smallest among all elements in the array.
3. The program calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements, which is the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array.

Since the program correctly identifies the maximum and minimum elements and calculates their difference, it will always return the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

Correctness: **True**
