You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the array, respectively, and then returns the difference between these two values.

This approach is correct because the maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always be the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array. The `max` and `min` functions will correctly identify these values, even if the array contains duplicate values, negative numbers, or zero.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 5, 3, 9, 2]`, the function will correctly return `8`, which is the difference between the maximum value `9` and the minimum value `1`. Similarly, if the input array is `[-5, 0, 5]`, the function will correctly return `10`, which is the difference between the maximum value `5` and the minimum value `-5`.

In all cases, the function will correctly calculate the maximum difference between any two elements in the array, making the program correct according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list `arr`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list. This implies that the function performs a comparison of all elements in the list to determine the minimum and maximum values, and then calculates their difference. The function does not modify the input list and does not handle potential edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element, as these scenarios would result in errors when attempting to find the minimum and maximum values. Additionally, the function assumes that the input list contains only integers, and does not account for potential errors that may occur if the list contains non-integer values. After the function concludes, the state of the program is that the input list remains unchanged, and the calculated difference between the maximum and minimum integer values is returned as the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
