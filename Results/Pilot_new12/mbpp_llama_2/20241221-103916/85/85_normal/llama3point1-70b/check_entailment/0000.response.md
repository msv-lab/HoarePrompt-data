Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function works by subtracting the minimum element in the array from the maximum element, which is the definition of the maximum difference between two elements.

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. The `max(arr)` function returns the maximum element in the array.
2. The `min(arr)` function returns the minimum element in the array.
3. The difference between the maximum and minimum elements is calculated using `max(arr) - min(arr)`.
4. This difference is returned as the result.

The function correctly handles the following cases:

* Empty arrays: This is not a problem in Python as trying to find max or min of an empty list will raise an error `ValueError: min() arg is an empty sequence`. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen in this case.
* Arrays with duplicate elements: The function will still return the correct maximum difference, as it only considers the maximum and minimum values in the array.
* Arrays with negative numbers: The function correctly handles negative numbers, as it uses the standard definition of maximum and minimum.
* Arrays with zero: The function correctly handles zeros, as it uses the standard definition of maximum and minimum.

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work correctly according to the description. However, the description should ideally handle edge cases like empty lists for a complete solution. 

To make the function more robust, you could add error checking to handle empty arrays, for example:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    if not arr:
        raise ValueError("Array is empty")
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
```
