Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks for a Python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided function `func_1` does exactly that.

Here's why it works:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `arr` as input.
2. It uses the built-in `max` and `min` functions to find the maximum and minimum integer values in the list `arr`.
3. The maximum difference between any two elements in the array is the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is what the function returns.

Since the input is assumed to be a list of integers with at least two elements, the `max` and `min` functions will always return valid values, and the difference between them will be the maximum difference between any two elements in the list.

For example, if the input is `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, the function will return `9 - 1 = 8`, which is the maximum difference between any two elements in the list.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements in the problem description.
