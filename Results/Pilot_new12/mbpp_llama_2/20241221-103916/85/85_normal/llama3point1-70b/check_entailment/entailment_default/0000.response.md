Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(arr)` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function uses the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to find the maximum and minimum elements in the array, respectively, and then returns their difference.

Although the output hints mention that the function does not handle edge cases such as an empty list or a list with a single element, we are assuming that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, we can ignore this aspect.

The function performs the required operation correctly for all valid inputs. It finds the maximum and minimum elements in the array and returns their difference, which is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. 

For example, if we have an array `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `5 - 1 = 4`, which is the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

In general, the function works as expected for any valid input array, and its output agrees with the problem description.
