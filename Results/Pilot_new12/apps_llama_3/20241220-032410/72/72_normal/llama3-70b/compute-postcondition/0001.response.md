The code calculates the value of `max_asked` based on the values of `k` and `n`. 

`max_asked` is assigned the value of the integer division of `k + (n - 1)` by `2 * n`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers, their values are determined by the input, and `max_asked` is equal to `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers, their values are determined by the input, and `max_asked` is `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`**
