To determine the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables. The code defines a new variable `min_asked` and assigns it a value based on `max_asked` and `n`. 

Given the initial state, `max_asked` is `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`. The code then calculates `min_asked` as `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`. This means `min_asked` will be at least 1, but its value depends on the result of subtracting `(n - 1)` from `max_asked`. If this subtraction results in a value less than 1, `min_asked` will be 1; otherwise, it will be the result of the subtraction.

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are not directly affected by this operation, as they are determined by the input and their current values do not influence the calculation of `min_asked` beyond what is already considered in `max_asked`.

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`, the updated or clarified value of `max_asked`, and the introduction of `min_asked` with its calculated value based on `max_asked` and `n`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers, `max_asked` is `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`, and `min_asked` is `max(1, (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n) - (n - 1))`.**
