The code `n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` by taking an input, splitting it into parts, converting each part to an integer, and assigning these integers to the variables. 

The initial state constraints that `n` and `m` are positive integers, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` and `y` are positive integers such that `1 <= x <= n` and `1 <= y <= m` are no longer guaranteed after the execution of this code because the new values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are determined by the input.

However, since the input values are assigned to `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` after being converted to integers, we can say that `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers. 

There is no constraint on the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` after the execution of the code, other than they are integers and they come from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers, their values are determined by the input.**
