Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly. The issue lies in the calculation of `sergei_asked`. The current formula `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)` does not accurately account for the fact that the teacher changes direction after reaching the last row. 

For example, consider the case where `n = 3`, `m = 2`, `k = 5`, `x = 2`, and `y = 1`. The correct order of asking pupils would be: 
1st row, 1st pupil, 
1st row, 2nd pupil, 
2nd row, 1st pupil (Sergei), 
2nd row, 2nd pupil, 
3rd row, 1st pupil, 
3rd row, 2nd pupil.

However, the formula provided would not accurately calculate the number of times Sergei is asked, as it does not account for the change in direction after the teacher reaches the last row. 

Additionally, the formula for `max_asked` and `min_asked` seems to be incorrect as well. It does not take into account the value of `m` (the number of pupils in each row), which affects the total number of questions asked.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
