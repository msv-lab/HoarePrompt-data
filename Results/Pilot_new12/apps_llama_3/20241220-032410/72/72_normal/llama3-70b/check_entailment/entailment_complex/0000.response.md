Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for several reasons:

1. The variable `y` is not used in the program, which means that the position of Sergei in the row is not taken into account when calculating the number of times Sergei is asked.

2. The formula `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)` does not correctly calculate the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked. This formula does not consider the case where `k` is not a multiple of `2 * n`, which can lead to incorrect results.

3. The formula `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked. This formula assumes that the minimum number of questions is always at least one, which may not be the case if `k` is less than `n`.

4. The formula `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)` does not correctly calculate the number of times Sergei is asked. This formula does not take into account the position of Sergei in the row, and it also does not handle the case where `k` is not a multiple of `2 * n`.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the position of Sergei in the row and the number of questions asked to each pupil in the row. We also need to handle the case where `k` is not a multiple of `2 * n`.

Here's a correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    total_pupils = n * m
    cycles = k // (2 * n * m)
    remaining_questions = k % (2 * n * m)
    max_asked = cycles
    min_asked = cycles

    if remaining_questions > 0:
        max_asked += 1
        rows_asked = remaining_questions // m
        if rows_asked < n:
            if x <= rows_asked + 1:
                if x == rows_asked + 1:
                    if y <= remaining_questions % m:
                        sergei_asked = cycles + 1
                    else:
                        sergei_asked = cycles
                else:
                    sergei_asked = cycles + 1
            else:
                sergei_asked = cycles
        else:
            if x == n:
                if y <= remaining_questions % m:
                    sergei_asked = cycles + 1
                else:
                    sergei_asked = cycles
            elif x == n - rows_asked % n:
                if y <= remaining_questions % m:
                    sergei_asked = cycles + 1
                else:
                    sergei_asked = cycles
            else:
                sergei_asked = cycles
    else:
        sergei_asked = cycles

    if k < total_pupils:
        min_asked = 0

    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
```
