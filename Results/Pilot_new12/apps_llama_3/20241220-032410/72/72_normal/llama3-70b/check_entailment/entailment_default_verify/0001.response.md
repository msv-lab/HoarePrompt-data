The original assessment seems to make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The assessment provides a clear explanation of how the code calculates the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

Upon analyzing the code and the output hints, I believe the original assessment is accurate. The code correctly applies mathematical formulas to calculate `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` based on the input parameters. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, printing the calculated values without modifying the input variables or performing error checking on the input values.

I maintain the original assessment because the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, and the output hints validate the expected behavior of the function. The code handles the cases where the teacher asks pupils in both directions and correctly determines the number of times Sergei is asked based on his position in the class.

The only potential issue with the code is the assumption that the input values are provided in the correct format and within the specified ranges, as mentioned in the output hints. However, this assumption is explicitly stated in the problem statement, which means the code is correct under the given constraints.

Therefore, based on the provided code, the output hints, and the problem description, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
