You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program seems to correctly calculate the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

Here is why I think the code is correct:

- The maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked is calculated by `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`. This formula takes into account the fact that the teacher asks pupils in both directions, and the number of questions asked is distributed evenly among the pupils.

- The minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked is calculated by `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`. This formula ensures that the minimum number of questions asked is at least 1, and it also takes into account the fact that the pupils in the middle rows may be asked fewer questions than the pupils in the top and bottom rows.

- The number of times Sergei is asked is calculated by `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`. This formula correctly determines whether Sergei will be asked during the current pass or the next pass of the teacher, and it also takes into account the fact that Sergei's position in the class affects when he will be asked.

I have checked several test cases, and the program seems to be producing the correct results in all of them. If I had to find a potential issue, it would be with integer overflow, but this is not a problem in Python because Python can handle arbitrarily large integers. 

Therefore, based on the provided code and the test cases, I believe the code is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and prints three values based on the input parameters n, m, k, x, and y. It computes `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` by applying mathematical formulas to the input values, where `max_asked` is the maximum number of times a question can be asked, `min_asked` is the minimum number of times a question must be asked, and `sergei_asked` is the number of times Sergei asks a question. The function accepts positive integers n and m, a non-negative integer k, and positive integers x and y within the ranges 1 to n and 1 to m, respectively, and returns no explicit value but instead prints the calculated values. The function does not perform any error checking on the input values, assuming they are provided in the correct format and within the specified ranges, and does not modify the input variables. After execution, the program's state is updated with the printed values, but the original input variables remain unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
