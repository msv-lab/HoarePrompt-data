Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately calculate the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

The problem description states that the teacher asks pupils in a specific order, changing direction when reaching the last row. The program attempts to simplify this by using division and modulo operations, but these calculations do not accurately reflect the teacher's asking pattern.

For example, when `n = 3` and `m = 3`, the teacher asks pupils in the following order:
1. Row 1, Pupil 1
2. Row 1, Pupil 2
3. Row 1, Pupil 3
4. Row 2, Pupil 1
5. Row 2, Pupil 2
6. Row 2, Pupil 3
7. Row 3, Pupil 1
8. Row 3, Pupil 2
9. Row 3, Pupil 3
10. Row 2, Pupil 1
11. Row 2, Pupil 2
12. Row 2, Pupil 3
13. Row 1, Pupil 1
14. Row 1, Pupil 2
15. Row 1, Pupil 3

However, the program's calculations for `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` do not take into account this specific order. The program assumes a uniform asking pattern, which is not the case.

A correct program would need to simulate the teacher's asking pattern and keep track of the number of times each pupil is asked. This would involve iterating through the asking order and updating the count for each pupil. The program would then be able to accurately calculate the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's count.

Here's a revised version of the program that accurately simulates the teacher's asking pattern:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = 0
    min_asked = float('inf')
    sergei_asked = 0
    asked_counts = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    
    direction = 1
    row = 0
    
    for _ in range(k):
        asked_counts[row][0] += 1
        if row == x - 1 and y == 1:
            sergei_asked += 1
        
        for col in range(1, m):
            asked_counts[row][col] += 1
            if row == x - 1 and col + 1 == y:
                sergei_asked += 1
        
        if direction == 1 and row == n - 1:
            direction = -1
        elif direction == -1 and row == 0:
            direction = 1
        
        row += direction
    
    for row in asked_counts:
        for count in row:
            max_asked = max(max_asked, count)
            min_asked = min(min_asked, count)
    
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
```
This revised program simulates the teacher's asking pattern and accurately calculates the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's count.
