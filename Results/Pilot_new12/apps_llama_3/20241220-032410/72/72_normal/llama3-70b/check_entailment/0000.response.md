Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not seem to accurately calculate the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's times asked when the total number of questions (`k`) exceeds the total number of students in the class.

For example, when `n = 100`, `m = 100`, `k = 1000000000000000000`, `x = 100`, and `y = 100`, the program calculates `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` based on a simplified formula that doesn't consider the actual number of times each student can be asked in the given number of questions.

To accurately calculate these values, we need to consider the total number of cycles (i.e., round trips from the first row to the last row and back) and the remaining number of questions after the last full cycle. Then we can calculate the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's times asked based on their positions in the class.

The provided program simplifies these calculations using the formulas `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`, `max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))`, and `(k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)`. However, these formulas are incorrect for large values of `k`.

Here is a counterexample:
Input:
```
100 100 1000000000000000000 100 100
```
The program's output:
```
50 1 50
```
This output is incorrect because the actual maximum, minimum, and Sergei's times asked would be significantly larger due to the large number of questions (`k`).

To fix this, we need a more complex algorithm that considers the total number of cycles and the remaining questions after the last full cycle.

Here is an example of a correct approach in Python:
```python
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    if n == 1:
        max_asked = k // m + (1 if k % m!= 0 else 0)
        min_asked = k // m
        sergei_asked = k // m + (1 if k % m >= y else 0)
    else:
        cycle_length = (n - 1) * 2
        cycle_ask_count = m * cycle_length
        full_cycles = k // cycle_ask_count
        remaining_questions = k % cycle_ask_count
        if remaining_questions == 0:
            max_asked = full_cycles
            min_asked = full_cycles
            sergei_asked = full_cycles
        else:
            cycle_position = remaining_questions // m
            if cycle_position < n:
                max_asked = full_cycles + 1
                min_asked = full_cycles
                if x <= cycle_position + 1:
                    sergei_asked = full_cycles + 1
                else:
                    sergei_asked = full_cycles
            else:
                cycle_position = cycle_position - n + 1
                max_asked = full_cycles + 1
                min_asked = full_cycles
                if x > cycle_position + 1:
                    sergei_asked = full_cycles + 1
                else:
                    sergei_asked = full_cycles
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)
```
This corrected version calculates the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's times asked based on the total number of cycles and the remaining number of questions after the last full cycle. It handles the cases when there is only one row and when there are multiple rows correctly.
