Correctness: **True**

The provided code and problem description align well, and the function appears to calculate the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei correctly.

The code assumes valid input and handles potential edge cases correctly. It accounts for the case where there is only one row in the class, where the teacher always asks children from this row.

The mathematical formulas used in the code to calculate `max_asked`, `min_asked`, and `sergei_asked` seem to accurately represent the described problem and its constraints.

The code also matches the expected output for the provided example cases. 

Overall, the code appears to be correct, and there is no apparent case where it does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly handles various potential cases, including different numbers of rows and pupils, and produces the expected output for the given examples.
