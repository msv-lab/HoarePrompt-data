Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`. If `row` is -1, then `row` is 1, `col` is 0, and `direction` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `row`, `col`, and `direction` are determined by the initial conditions, where if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `row` is 0, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1; `col`, `sergei_questions`, and other variables remain unchanged if this condition is not met.**
