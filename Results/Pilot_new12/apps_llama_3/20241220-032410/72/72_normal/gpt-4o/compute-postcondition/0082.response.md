The value of `max_questions` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `max_questions` is not specified, but it is implied to be greater than or equal to 1 since `remaining_questions` is greater than 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is either 0 or equal to `y` if `row` is equal to `x` and the initial `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged, the direction is not equal to 1, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is either 0 or equal to `y` if `row` is equal to `x` and the initial `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged, the direction is not equal to 1, and `max_questions` is decreased by 1**
