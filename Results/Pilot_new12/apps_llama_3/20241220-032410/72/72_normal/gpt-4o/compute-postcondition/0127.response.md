The code reverses the direction by setting `direction` to -1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `remaining_questions` is still greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `row` is `n`, `max_questions` has been increased by 1, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` has been increased by the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the loop, with an additional increment if the current values of `row` and `col` are such that `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `row` is `n`, `max_questions` has been increased by 1, `col` is 0, `direction` is -1, and `sergei_questions` has been increased by the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the loop, with an additional increment if the current values of `row` and `col` are such that `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`.**
