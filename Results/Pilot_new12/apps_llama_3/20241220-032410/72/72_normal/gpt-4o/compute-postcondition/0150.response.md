Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `col` is 1, if `row` is -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 3` and `direction` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `row` and `direction` remain unchanged, `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` remain unchanged, given that `row` does not equal `x` or `col` does not equal `y`, and the previous conditions for `row`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions` still apply***
