Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1. If `row` equals `n`, then `col` is either 0 or a value that was set when `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` was increased by 1, `row` equals `n - 2`, and if the new `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` does not equal `n`, then the state of the variables remains as in the precondition, with `row` increased by 1, and `max_questions` increased by 1, and if the new `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `row` is 0, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
