Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1 from its previous state, `col` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 3`, `direction` is -1, and if the updated `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `row` remains `row + direction`, and if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. In both cases, `x`, `y`, `n` remain as determined by their previous conditions***
