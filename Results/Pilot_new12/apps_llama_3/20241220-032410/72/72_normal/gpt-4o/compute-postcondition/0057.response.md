The code increments `max_questions` by 1. The previous value of `max_questions` is unknown, so the output state is: `max_questions` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer plus 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged. However, `max_questions` is now increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer plus 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of `sergei_questions` remains unchanged.**
