Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is either increased or decreased by 1 depending on the direction. If `direction` equals 1, then `col` is either 0 or equal to `y` if `row + 1` equals `x` and the initial `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, and `row` is either `row + 1` or `n - 2` if `row` equals `n`. If `direction` does not equal 1, then `col` is either 0 or equal to `y` if the previous `row` is equal to `x` and the initial `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the previous `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `row` is either set to 1 if it is -1 or remains unchanged, and `direction` is set to 1 if `row` is -1.***
