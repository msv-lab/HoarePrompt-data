Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer plus 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 3` and `direction` is -1; if the updated `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains the same; if `row` does not equal `n`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.**
