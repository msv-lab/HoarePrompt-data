Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, the current value of `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, and `max_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`**
