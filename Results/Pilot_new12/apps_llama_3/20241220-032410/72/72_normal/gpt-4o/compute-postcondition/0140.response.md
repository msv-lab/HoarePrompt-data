Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `col` is 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` has been increased by the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the loop, with an additional increment. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` has been increased by 1. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is `n - 2` and `direction` is -1. If `direction` is not 1, then `max_questions` has been decreased by 1 from its previous value. If `row` is -1 when `direction` is not 1, then `row` is set to 1 and `direction` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `row`, `direction`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions` remain unchanged from their previous state, given that `row` does not equal `x` or `col` does not equal `y`.***
