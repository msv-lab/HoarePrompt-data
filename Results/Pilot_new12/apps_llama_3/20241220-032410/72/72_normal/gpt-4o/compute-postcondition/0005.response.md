To determine the output state, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state includes:

- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer minus 1
- `y` is an input integer minus 1
- `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `m`
- `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1` else `k // m`

The code provided is:

```python
remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
```

This line of code calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `full_cycle_length` and assigns it to `remaining_questions`.

Given the initial state, we can conclude that:

- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, and `full_cycles` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the given code snippet.
- `remaining_questions` is assigned the value of `k % full_cycle_length`, which can be expressed as `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1` else `k % m`.

Therefore, the output state includes all the initial state variables with their respective conditions, plus the new variable `remaining_questions` with its calculated value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1` else `k // m`, and `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)` if `n > 1` else `k % m`.**
