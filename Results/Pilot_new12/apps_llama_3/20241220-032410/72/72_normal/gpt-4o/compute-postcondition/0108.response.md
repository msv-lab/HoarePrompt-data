The value of `direction` is updated to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than the new value of `col`, `col` is increased by 1, `row` is `row + (-1)`, if `row + (-1)` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and `max_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than the new value of `col`, `col` is increased by 1, `row` is `row - 1`, if `row - 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and `max_questions` is increased by 1**
