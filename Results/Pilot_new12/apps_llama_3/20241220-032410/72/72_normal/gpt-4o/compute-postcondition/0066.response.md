Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer plus 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` is -1, then `direction` is 1, `row` is increased by 3. If `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` is not -1, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part.**
