Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is either 0 or equal to `y` if `row + 1` equals `x` and the initial `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `n`, then `direction` is -1 and `row` equals `n - 2`, otherwise `direction` is 1 and `row` is `row + 1`.***
