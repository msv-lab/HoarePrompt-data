The code changes the value of `direction` to -1. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `col` is either 0 or a value that was set when `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` was increased by 1, `row` equals `n`, and if the new `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `col` is either 0 or a value that was set when `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` was increased by 1, `row` equals `n`, and if the new `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
