Postcondition: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `row` has been increased by 1, `max_questions` has been increased by 1, `col` is 0, `direction` is 1, and `sergei_questions` has been increased by the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the loop, with an additional increment if the current values of `row` and `col` are such that `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. The current value of `row` equals `n`.**
