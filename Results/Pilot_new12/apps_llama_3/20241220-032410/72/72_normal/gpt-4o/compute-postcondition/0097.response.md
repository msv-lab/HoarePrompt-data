The code `max_questions -= 1` decreases the value of `max_questions` by 1. Given the initial state, `max_questions` is either increased or decreased by 1 depending on the direction, but now it is explicitly decreased by 1.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 from its previous value, `col` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and other variables (`row`, `direction`, `x`, `y`, `n`) remain as determined by their previous conditions**
