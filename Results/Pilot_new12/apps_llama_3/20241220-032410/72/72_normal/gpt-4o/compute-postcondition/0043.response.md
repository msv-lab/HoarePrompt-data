To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is greater than 1
- `k` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer minus 1
- `y` is an input integer minus 1
- `remaining_questions` is greater than 0
- `col` is an input integer
- If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1

The code snippet is:
```python
max_questions += 1
```

The code increments the value of `max_questions` by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer, `max_questions` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
