It appears there are no parameters defined for the function `func()`. However, based on the provided constraints, I will assume that the function should accept parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`.


The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. `n` and `m` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100 and 1 <= `m` <= 100, `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10^18, `x` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `x` <= `n`, and `y` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `y` <= `m`. Since there is no clear output or return value described, I must infer that the task is to define the functionality based on the given constraints.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, x, and y, where n and m are integers between 1 and 100, k is an integer between 1 and 10^18, and x and y are integers within the ranges of n and m respectively.**
