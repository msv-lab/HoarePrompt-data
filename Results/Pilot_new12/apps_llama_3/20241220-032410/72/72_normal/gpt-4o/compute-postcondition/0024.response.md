Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `col` is 0, `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `row` is 0, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `row`, `col`, and other variables remain unchanged.***
