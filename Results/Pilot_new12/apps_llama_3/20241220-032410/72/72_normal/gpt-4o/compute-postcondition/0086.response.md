The code increments the `row` by 2. The previous value of `row` is -1. 

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, the current `col` is either 0 or equal to `y` if the previous `row` is equal to `x` and the initial `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the previous `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, otherwise its state remains unchanged, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `row` is 1, `direction` is 1**
