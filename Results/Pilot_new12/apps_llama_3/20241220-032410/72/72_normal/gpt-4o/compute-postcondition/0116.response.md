Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is increased by 1. If `direction` is 1, then if `row` equals `n`, `row` is `row - 3` and `m` is greater than `col + 1`, otherwise `row` remains `row + direction`. If the new `row` and `col` equal `x` and `y` respectively, then `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` are both increased by 1. If `direction` is not 1, then `m` is greater than the new value of `col`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` is -1, then `row` is increased by 3 and `direction` is 1. In all cases, if the new value of `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `direction` is not 1, `row` is increased by `direction`.***
