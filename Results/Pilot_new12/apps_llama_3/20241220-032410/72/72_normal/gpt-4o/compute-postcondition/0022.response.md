Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, the initial value of `x` and `y` were input integers, but currently `x` is an input integer minus 1 and `y` is an input integer minus 1. The current value of `row` is 0 and the current value of `col` is 0. `direction` is 1 and `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. Additionally, the current state is such that `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`.**
