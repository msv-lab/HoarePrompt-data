Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `col` is increased by 1. If `direction` equals 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 3` and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, `row` is updated to `row + direction`. If the updated `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `direction` does not equal 1, then `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and if `row` equals -1, then `row` is updated to `row + 3` and `direction` is set to 1. In this case, if the updated `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. In both cases, `x`, `y`, `n` remain as determined by their previous conditions.***
