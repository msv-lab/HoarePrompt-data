Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `col` is 2. If `direction` equals 1, then `max_questions` is `max_questions_initial + 1`. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 3`, `direction` is -1, and if the updated `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` does not equal `n`, then `row` is `row + direction` and if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `direction` does not equal 1, then if `row` is -1, `direction` is 1 and `row` is `row + 3`, and if `row + 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` is not -1, then `row` is `row + direction` and if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
