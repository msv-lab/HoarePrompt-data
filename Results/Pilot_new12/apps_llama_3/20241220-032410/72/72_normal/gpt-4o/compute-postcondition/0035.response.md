Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, initially `col` is 0, initially `direction` is not equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`, the current value of `row` is -1, the current value of `col` is 0, `direction` is not equal to 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, and `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`. Additionally, `sergei_questions` and other variables retain their previous values since the condition for updating them is not met. The current state of the program variables reflects that `row` equals -1, indicating the specified condition is true.**
