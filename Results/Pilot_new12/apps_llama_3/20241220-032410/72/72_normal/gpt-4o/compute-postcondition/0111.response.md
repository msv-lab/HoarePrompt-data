`max_questions` is decreased by 1. The initial state of `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than the new value of `col`, `col` is increased by 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than the new value of `col`, `col` is increased by 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
