The value of `row` is decreased by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is `row` minus 2, if `row - 1 - 2` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `direction` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is `row` minus 2, if `row - 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `direction` is -1**
