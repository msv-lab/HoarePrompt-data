The code `y -= 1` decreases the value of `y` by 1. Given the initial state, `y` is an input integer, so after the decrease, `y` becomes an input integer minus 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, and `x`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1**
