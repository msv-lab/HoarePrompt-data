Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, initially `col` was 0, initially `direction` was 1, initially `remaining_questions` was greater than 0, initially `max_questions` was increased by 1, `row` was increased by 1, if the new `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then the current value of `row` is 0, the current value of `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. The current value of `row` is equal to `n`.**
