Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, if `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `max_questions` is `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`, and `sergei_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, else `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // m`, `remaining_questions` is `k % m`, `min_questions` is `k // m`, `max_questions` is `k // m`, and `sergei_questions` is `k // m`. Additionally, `x` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `n - 1`.**
