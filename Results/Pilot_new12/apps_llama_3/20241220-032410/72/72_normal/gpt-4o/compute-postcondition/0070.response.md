According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `col` and `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, but this does not directly ensure that the loop will execute. For the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 0 and `col` is now 0.

State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, `m` must be greater than 0, `col` is 0**
