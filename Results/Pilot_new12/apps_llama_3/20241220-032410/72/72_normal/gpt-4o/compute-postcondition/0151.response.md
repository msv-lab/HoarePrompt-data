Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `col` is 1. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` is the previous value of `max_questions` plus 1, `sergei_questions` has been increased by the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the loop, with an additional increment. If `row` equals `n` when `direction` is 1, then `row` is `(row + previous direction) - 2` and `direction` is -1. If `direction` is not 1, then `max_questions` has been decreased by 1 from its previous value. If `row` is -1 when `direction` is not 1, then `row` is updated to `row + 3` and `direction` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `row` and `direction` remain unchanged as there are no further modifications, `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` remain unchanged given that `row` does not equal `x` or `col` does not equal `y`, and the previous conditions for `row`, `sergei_questions`, and `max_questions` still apply.***
