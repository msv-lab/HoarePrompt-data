Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is `row - 3` and `m` is greater than `col + 1`, otherwise `row` remains `row + direction`. If the new `row` and `col` equal `x` and `y` respectively, then `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` are both increased by 1***
