The value of `row` is increased by `direction`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` (or `max_questions`) is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `col` is 2, `row` is increased by `direction`, and if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.
