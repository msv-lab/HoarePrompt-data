Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is the previous value of `max_questions` plus 1, `sergei_questions` has been increased by the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the loop, with an additional increment, if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is `(row + previous direction) - 2` and `direction` is -1, otherwise the values of `row` and `direction` remain unchanged as there is no else part to modify them***
