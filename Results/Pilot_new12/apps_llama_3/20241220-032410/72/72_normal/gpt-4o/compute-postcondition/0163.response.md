The value of `row` is increased by 2. The previous value of `row` was `row + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `row` is `(row + 1) + 2` which is `row + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The condition for `sergei_questions` to be increased by 1 is still dependent on the values of `row` and `col` being equal to `x` and `y` respectively. 

Output State: **`remaining_questions` (or `max_questions`) is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `col` is 2, `direction` is 1, `row` is `row + 3`, and if `row + 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
