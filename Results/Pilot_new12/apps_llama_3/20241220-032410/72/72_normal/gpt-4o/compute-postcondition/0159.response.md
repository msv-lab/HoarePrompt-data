Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `col` is 2, `max_questions` is `max_questions_initial + 1`. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 3`, `direction` is -1, and if the updated `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` does not equal `n`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `row` being `row + direction` and if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
