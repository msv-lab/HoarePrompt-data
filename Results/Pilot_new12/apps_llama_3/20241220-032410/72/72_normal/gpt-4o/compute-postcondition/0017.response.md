Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `max_questions` is `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`, and `sergei_questions` is determined based on whether `x` equals 0 or `n-1` or not. If `x` equals 0 or `n-1`, then `sergei_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, otherwise, `sergei_questions` is `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`. If `n` is not greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // m`, `remaining_questions` is `k % m`, `min_questions` is `k // m`, `max_questions` is `k // m`, and `sergei_questions` is `k // m`.**
