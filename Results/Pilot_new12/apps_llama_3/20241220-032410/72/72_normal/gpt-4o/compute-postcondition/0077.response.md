Postcondition: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, initially `col` is either 0 or equal to `y` if `row + 1` equals `x` and the initial `col` is 0, the current value of `col` is determined based on previous conditions, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `direction` is 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` has been incremented by 1 in the past and now the current value of `row` equals `n`.**
