The value of `direction` is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `row` is `row + direction` which is now `row + 1`. If `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `direction` is 1, `row` is `row + 1`, and if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
