The code `direction = -1` changes the value of `direction` to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `row` is `row + direction`, but since `direction` is now -1, `row` becomes `row - 1`. 
If `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. 
However, since `direction` is now -1, the condition `row + direction` equals `x` becomes `row - 1` equals `x`. 

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1 from its previous state, `col` is increased by 1, `row` is `row - 1`, `direction` is -1, if `row - 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, `x`, `y`, `n` remain as determined by their previous conditions**
