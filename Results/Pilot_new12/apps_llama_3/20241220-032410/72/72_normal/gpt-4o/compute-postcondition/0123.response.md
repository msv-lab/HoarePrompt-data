Postcondition: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `row` and `direction` have values based on the last iteration's operations regarding `n`, `max_questions` is adjusted based on the net effect of `direction` changes, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the loop, with an additional increment if the current values of `row` and `col` are such that `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. The current value of `direction` is 1.**
