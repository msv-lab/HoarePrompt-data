Postcondition: **`remaining_questions` (or `max_questions`) is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `col` is 2. If `row` is -1, then `direction` is 1 and `row` is `row + 3`. If `row + 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` is not -1, the state remains unchanged as there are no modifications specified in the else part, however since no else part is given, we must look at the original precondition for `row` which is `row` is `row + direction`.**
