The code `max_questions -= 1` decreases the value of `max_questions` by 1. The previous value of `max_questions` is not specified, so we can only state that its value is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer plus 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
