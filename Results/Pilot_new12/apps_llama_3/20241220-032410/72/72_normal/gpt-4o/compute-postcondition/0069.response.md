According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `remaining_questions`. If `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_questions` must be at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `remaining_questions` must be greater than 1, because the loop has already executed once, so it has been decreased by 1.
State: **`remaining_questions` must be greater than 1**
