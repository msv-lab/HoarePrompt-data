Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer plus 1. If `direction` equals 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row - 3` and `direction` is -1; if the updated `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `direction` does not equal 1, then `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` is -1, then `direction` is 1 and `row` is increased by 3; if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. In all other cases, the state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the updates to `max_questions`, `direction`, `row`, and `sergei_questions` as described above.**
