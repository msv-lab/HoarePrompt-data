Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than the new value of `col`, `col` is increased by 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` is -1, then `row` is increased by 3 and `direction` is 1. In all cases, if the new value of `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `row` is increased by `direction`.***
