Postcondition: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `max_questions` has been increased by 1, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` has been increased by the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the loop, with an additional increment if the current values of `row` and `col` are such that `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is `n - 2` and `direction` is -1. Otherwise, the state of `row` and `direction` remains unchanged.**
