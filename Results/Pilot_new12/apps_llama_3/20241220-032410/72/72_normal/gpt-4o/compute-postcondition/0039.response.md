Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0. If `direction` equals 1, then if `row` equals `n`, `col` is either 0 or a value that was set when `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `direction` is -1, `max_questions` was increased by 1, `row` equals `n - 2`, and if the new `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` does not equal `n`, then the state of the variables remains as in the precondition, with `row` increased by 1, and `max_questions` increased by 1, and if the new `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `row` is 0, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1. If `direction` does not equal 1, then `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`. If `row` is -1, then `row` is 1, `col` is 0, and `direction` is 1. Otherwise, the values of `row`, `col`, and `direction` are determined by the initial conditions, where if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `row` is 0, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1; `col`, `sergei_questions`, and other variables remain unchanged if this condition is not met.***
