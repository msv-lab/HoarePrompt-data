Postcondition: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `col` is either 0 or equal to `y` if `row` is equal to `x` and the initial `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged. The direction is not equal to 1.**
