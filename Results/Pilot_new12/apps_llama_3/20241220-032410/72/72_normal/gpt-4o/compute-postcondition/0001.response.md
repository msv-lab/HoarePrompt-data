The code `x -= 1` decreases the value of `x` by 1. The initial state is `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, and `y` are not affected by the code. The value of `x` is decreased by 1, so the new value of `x` is `x - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer**
