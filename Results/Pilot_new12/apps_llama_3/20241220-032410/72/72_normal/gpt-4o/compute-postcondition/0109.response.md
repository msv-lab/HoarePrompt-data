The value of `row` is decreased by 2. The previous value of `row` was `row - 1`, so the new value of `row` is `row - 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The condition `if row - 1 equals x and col equals y` is still valid for the previous value of `row`, but now `row - 1` is `row - 3 - 1 + 1` which equals `row - 3`. So the condition is now checked for `row - 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`. Therefore, the Output State is: `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than the new value of `col`, `col` is increased by 1, `row` is `row - 3`, if `row - 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and `max_questions` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than `col + 1`, `col` is increased by 1, `row` is `row - 3`, if `row - 3` equals `x` and `col + 1` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and `max_questions` is increased by 1**
