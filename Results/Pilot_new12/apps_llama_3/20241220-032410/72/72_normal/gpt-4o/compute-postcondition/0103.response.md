According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `col` and `m`. If `col` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `col` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute again, `col` must be increased by 1 and `m` must be greater than the new value of `col`. 

State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than the new value of `col`, `col` is increased by 1**
