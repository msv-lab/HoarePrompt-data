Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer, `max_questions` is increased by 1. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` is updated to `row` minus 2, and if `row - 3` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `direction` is -1. If `row` does not equal `n`, the state of the variables remains as is, with `row` being `row` plus `direction`, and if `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.***
