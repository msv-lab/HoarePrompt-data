`max_questions` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. The value of `remaining_questions` is still greater than 1, `m` is still greater than the new value of `col`, `col` is still increased by 1, and if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is still increased by 1.

Output State: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than the new value of `col`, `col` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `max_questions` is increased by 1**
