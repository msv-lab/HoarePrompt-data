Postcondition: **`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `row` has been updated to `row + direction` based on previous operations, with the current value of `row` being -1, `direction` has values based on the last iteration's operations regarding `n`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 from its previous value based on the net effect of `direction` changes, `col` is 0, `sergei_questions` has been increased by the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the loop, with an additional increment if the current values of `row` and `col` are such that `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, and the `direction` is not equal to 1, and now `row` equals -1**
