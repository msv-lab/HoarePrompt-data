The code calculates `full_cycle_length` based on the values of `n` and `m`. If `n` is greater than 1, `full_cycle_length` is assigned the value `(2 * n - 2) * m`; otherwise, it is assigned the value `m`. 

The states of the other variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, and `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n` is greater than 1, otherwise `full_cycle_length` is `m`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, and `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m` if `n > 1` else `m`**
