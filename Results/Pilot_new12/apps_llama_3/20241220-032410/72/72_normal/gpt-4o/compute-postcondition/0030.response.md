The value of `row` is decreased by 2. The previous value of `row` was `n`, so the new value of `row` is `n - 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `col` is either 0 or a value that was set when `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, `direction` is -1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` was increased by 1, `row` equals `n - 2`, and if the new `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
