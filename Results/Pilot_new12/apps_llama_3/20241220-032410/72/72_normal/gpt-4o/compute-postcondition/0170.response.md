Functionality: **The function calculates and prints the minimum, maximum, and Sergei's questions after a series of operations based on the input parameters n, m, k, x, and y. It determines the number of full cycles and remaining questions, then updates the questions based on the position of x and y within the cycle. The function handles different cases depending on the values of n and x, and iterates through the remaining questions to update the questions counts. The final output includes the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's questions. The function accepts parameters n and m (non-negative integers between 1 and 100), k (a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18), and x and y (non-negative integers within the ranges of n and m respectively), and returns the calculated questions counts. The function's state after execution includes the updated values of max_questions, min_questions, and sergei_questions, which are printed as output. The function handles edge cases such as n being greater than 1 and x being 0 or n-1, and calculates the questions counts accordingly.**
