Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is decreased by 1. If `row` is -1, then `row` is set to 1 and `direction` is set to 1. In all cases, `col` is either 0 or equal to `y` if the previous `row` is equal to `x` and the initial `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if the previous `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, otherwise its state remains unchanged.***
