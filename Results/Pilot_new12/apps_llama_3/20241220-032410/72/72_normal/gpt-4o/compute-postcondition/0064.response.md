The value of `direction` is set to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `row` is increased by `direction`, so `row` is increased by 1.
The condition `if row + direction equals x and col equals y` is still valid, so if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer plus 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `direction` is 1, `row` is increased by 1, and if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `col` is an input integer plus 1, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, `direction` is 1, `row` is increased by 1, and if `row + 1` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1**
