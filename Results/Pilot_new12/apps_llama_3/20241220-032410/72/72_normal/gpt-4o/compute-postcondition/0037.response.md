The code `row += 2` increments the value of `row` by 2. Given the initial state where `row` is -1, the new value of `row` becomes -1 + 2 = 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1, `row` is 1, `col` is 0, `direction` is 1, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `max_questions` is `max_questions - 1`**
