Postcondition: ***`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, if `row` is -1, then `row` is set to 1 and `direction` is set to 1, otherwise the values of `row` and `direction` remain unchanged, `max_questions` is decreased by 1 from its previous value, `col` is 0, and `sergei_questions` has been increased by the number of times `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the loop, with an additional increment if the current values of `row` and `col` are such that `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, and the `direction` is not equal to 1***
