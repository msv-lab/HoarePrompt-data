Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the teacher's questioning sequence and accurately calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions asked to any pupil and the number of times Sergei is asked.

The key to the correct implementation is the way the program handles the full cycles and the remaining questions. The full cycles are calculated correctly as `k // full_cycle_length`, and the remaining questions are calculated as `k % full_cycle_length`. The program then correctly calculates the minimum and maximum number of questions asked to any pupil based on the full cycles and the remaining questions.

The program also correctly handles the edge cases where `n` is 1, in which case the teacher always asks children from the same row. In this case, the program correctly calculates the maximum and minimum number of questions asked to any pupil and the number of times Sergei is asked.

The program's logic for calculating the number of times Sergei is asked is also correct. It first calculates the number of times Sergei would be asked if there were only full cycles, and then checks if Sergei would be asked in the remaining questions.

I was unable to find any case where the program does not work correctly. The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all the edge cases. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
