Correctness: **True**.

After thoroughly examining the provided code and the problem description, it appears that the program correctly calculates the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

The code first calculates the full cycles and remaining questions based on the total number of questions asked by the teacher. It then determines the minimum and maximum number of questions asked to any pupil based on the full cycles. For Sergei's questions, it calculates the number of times he is asked based on his position and the remaining questions.

The code also correctly handles the case where there is only one row in the class, as well as the case where Sergei is sitting in the first or last row.

One potential concern could be the handling of edge cases, such as when the input values are very large or when the teacher asks a very large number of questions. However, the code uses integer division and modulo operations to handle these cases correctly.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid input values. If I couldn't think of an example where the program does not work as expected, it suggests that the program is correct. 

However, it's worth noting that due to the complexity of the code and the problem description, it is possible that a subtle bug or edge case could have been missed. Further testing and verification would be necessary to confirm the correctness of the code in all possible scenarios.
