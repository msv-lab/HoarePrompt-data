Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. 

Here are some issues:

1. The program does not handle the case when `n` equals 1 correctly. In this case, the teacher always asks children from the same row, but the program still uses the `full_cycle_length` and `full_cycles` variables, which are calculated as if the teacher was asking children from multiple rows.

2. The program does not correctly calculate the number of questions asked to Sergei. It uses a complex logic to calculate `sergei_questions`, but this logic is not correct. The program should simply count the number of times Sergei is asked a question during the simulation of the asking process.

3. The program does not correctly calculate the maximum and minimum number of questions asked to a pupil. The `max_questions` and `min_questions` variables are calculated incorrectly. The program should simulate the asking process and count the number of questions asked to each pupil to find the maximum and minimum.

4. The program does not handle the `remaining_questions` correctly. It simulates the asking process for the remaining questions, but it does not correctly update the `max_questions` and `min_questions` variables.

5. The program does not correctly handle the case when `x` equals 0 or `n-1`. In this case, the program uses a special logic to calculate `sergei_questions`, but this logic is not correct.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program should simulate the asking process and count the number of questions asked to each pupil. It should also correctly handle the case when `n` equals 1 and the case when `x` equals 0 or `n-1`.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    max_questions = 0
    min_questions = float('inf')
    sergei_questions = 0
    questions = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]

    row = 0
    direction = 1
    for _ in range(k):
        for col in range(m):
            questions[row][col] += 1
            if row == x - 1 and col == y - 1:
                sergei_questions += 1
            if direction == 1:
                row += direction
                if row == n:
                    direction = -1
                    row -= 2
            else:
                row += direction
                if row == -1:
                    direction = 1
                    row += 2

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            max_questions = max(max_questions, questions[i][j])
            min_questions = min(min_questions, questions[i][j])

    print(max_questions, min_questions, sergei_questions)
```

This implementation correctly simulates the asking process and counts the number of questions asked to each pupil. It also correctly handles the case when `n` equals 1 and the case when `x` equals 0 or `n-1`.
