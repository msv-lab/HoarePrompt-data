Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not accurately calculate the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's questions in all cases, particularly for large inputs and certain edge cases.

One specific issue arises from the way the code handles the `max_questions` and `min_questions` variables. When `n` is greater than 1, the code calculates these values as `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)` and `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`, respectively. However, this approach does not consider the impact of the `remaining_questions` on the distribution of questions across the rows.

Furthermore, the code's logic for updating `max_questions` during the iteration of `remaining_questions` is flawed. It increments `max_questions` by 1 when moving in the positive direction but does not correctly adjust it when moving in the negative direction or when transitioning between rows.

Another issue is with the calculation of `sergei_questions`. The code checks if `x` is 0 or `n-1` and updates `sergei_questions` accordingly, but this logic is incomplete. It does not account for the situation when `x` is not at the boundary rows but still receives an uneven number of questions due to the cyclical nature of the questioning process.

Lastly, the provided code does not properly validate its calculations against the constraints and examples given in the problem description, particularly for large values of `k` and edge cases such as when `n` equals 1 or when `x` and `y` are at the boundaries.

To ensure correctness, the code needs a more nuanced approach to calculating the distribution of questions among students, especially considering the cyclical pattern and the impact of `remaining_questions`. Additionally, thorough testing against the provided examples and extreme cases is necessary to validate the code's correctness. 

Given the complexity and the potential for the current implementation to produce incorrect results for a variety of inputs, it is reasonable to conclude that the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
