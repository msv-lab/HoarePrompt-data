Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are non-negative integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= 100, k is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, x is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= x <= n, and y is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= y <= m.
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m
    full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
    remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
    min_questions = full_cycles
    max_questions = full_cycles
    if (n > 1) :
        min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)
        max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, and `max_questions` is `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `n` is not greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // m`, `remaining_questions` is `k % m`, and both `min_questions` and `max_questions` are `k // m`.
    sergei_questions = min_questions
    if (x == 0 or x == n - 1) :
        sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1
    )
    else :
        sergei_questions = (full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 *
    n - 2) >= x)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer minus 1, `y` is an input integer minus 1. If `n` is greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `remaining_questions` is `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `max_questions` is `(k // ((2 * n - 2) * m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`, and `sergei_questions` is determined based on whether `x` equals 0 or `n-1` or not. If `x` equals 0 or `n-1`, then `sergei_questions` is `k // ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, otherwise, `sergei_questions` is `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`. If `n` is not greater than 1, then `full_cycle_length` is `m`, `full_cycles` is `k // m`, `remaining_questions` is `k % m`, `min_questions` is `k // m`, `max_questions` is `k // m`, and `sergei_questions` is `k // m`.
    row = 0
    direction = 1
    for _ in range(remaining_questions):
        for col in range(m):
            if row == x and col == y:
                sergei_questions += 1
            if direction == 1:
                max_questions += 1
                row += direction
                if row == n:
                    direction = -1
                    row -= 2
            else:
                max_questions -= 1
                row += direction
                if row == -1:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `remaining_questions` is 0, `row` and `direction` are determined by the last iteration's operations regarding `n` and the loop's path, `max_questions` reflects the net effect of `direction` changes, and `sergei_questions` is the original value plus the occurrences where `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` during the loop, with other variables retaining their last updated or initial values based on the conditions provided.
    print(max_questions, min_questions, sergei_questions)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the minimum, maximum, and Sergei's questions after a series of operations based on the input parameters n, m, k, x, and y. It determines the number of full cycles and remaining questions, then updates the questions based on the position of x and y within the cycle. The function handles different cases depending on the values of n and x, and iterates through the remaining questions to update the questions counts. The final output includes the maximum, minimum, and Sergei's questions. The function accepts parameters n and m (non-negative integers between 1 and 100), k (a non-negative integer between 1 and 10^18), and x and y (non-negative integers within the ranges of n and m respectively), and returns the calculated questions counts. The function's state after execution includes the updated values of max_questions, min_questions, and sergei_questions, which are printed as output. The function handles edge cases such as n being greater than 1 and x being 0 or n-1, and calculates the questions counts accordingly.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
