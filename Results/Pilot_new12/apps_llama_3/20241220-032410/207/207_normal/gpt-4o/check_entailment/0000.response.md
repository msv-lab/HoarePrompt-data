Correctness: **True**.

The given program seems to correctly calculate the sum of all `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. The `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. The `func_2` calculates the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`. If the GCD of `a` and `b` is not `1`, it recursively calls itself with `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`, where `g` is the GCD, and multiplies the result by `g`. This is because if the GCD is not `1`, the frog can only reach numbers that are multiples of the GCD.
3. If the GCD is `1`, it calculates the sum of `f(i)` in two parts: `sum_k` and `sum_m`. `sum_k` is the sum of numbers from `1` to `k`, where `k = a + b - 1`. This is because for `m < k`, the frog can only reach numbers from `1` to `m`, and the sum of these numbers is `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2`. `sum_m` is the sum of numbers from `k + 1` to `m`, which is `m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2`.
4. The `func_2` returns the sum of `sum_k` and `sum_m`.

The code correctly handles different cases, including when the GCD of `a` and `b` is not `1`, and when `m` is less than `k`. It also correctly calculates the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`.

I couldn't find any cases where the program does not work correctly. The provided examples also seem to be handled correctly by the program. Therefore, I believe the program is correct.
