Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code, including the functions `func_1` and `func_2`, correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. 

The problem asks for the sum of the number of distinct integers a frog can reach from position 0 to `m` on the number line, where the frog can jump either `a` or `-b` from any position `k`. The function `func_2` calculates this sum.

The function `func_1` calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is used in `func_2` to reduce the problem size when the GCD of `a` and `b` is greater than 1.

The code handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description, including the base case when `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, and the recursive case when the GCD of `a` and `b` is greater than 1.

The provided examples in the problem description match the expected output of the code. The code correctly calculates the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach for each example.

The annotations provided in the code are mostly accurate, and they help understand the logic and intention behind the code. However, some annotations may be slightly misleading, but the code itself correctly implements the problem logic.

In conclusion, the code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
