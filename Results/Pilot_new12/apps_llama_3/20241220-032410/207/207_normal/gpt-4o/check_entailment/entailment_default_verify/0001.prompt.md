You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        (x, y) = (y, x % y)
    return x

#Function 2:
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if g != 1:
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
    k = a + b - 1
    if m < k:
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program seems to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The problem can be divided into two cases: when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is 1, and when it's not. 

2. If the GCD is not 1, we can divide both `a` and `b` by the GCD and the problem is reduced to the same problem with the new `a` and `b`. This is implemented in the `func_2` function.

3. If the GCD is 1, then the frog can reach all integers from 0 to `m`. The number of distinct integers the frog can reach is `m + 1` for `m < a + b - 1` and `m + 1` for `m >= a + b - 1` as well. This is also handled by the `func_2` function.

4. The function calculates the sum of `f(i)` from 0 to `m` using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

5. The examples provided also match the output of the program.

Since I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected, I believe the program is correct. The use of recursion to handle the case when the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1, and the use of the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of `f(i)` from 0 to `m` are key insights that make the program correct. 

However, one thing to note is that the function `func_1` calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, and `func_2` uses recursion to handle the case when the GCD is not 1. But since the recursion is based on dividing by the GCD, it will always terminate. 

In general, the program handles the problem in a mathematically sound way and the code is well-structured and clear. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : Functionality: The function `func_2` calculates a value based on the input parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `m` is a non-negative integer and `a` and `b` are positive integers. The function applies a recursive approach, using the result of another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the next steps. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a value not equal to 1, the function calls itself with modified parameters and multiplies the result by the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. If `func_1(a, b)` returns 1, the function then checks if `m` is less than the sum of `a` and `b` minus 1. If this condition is met, it returns the sum of the first `m+1` positive integers. Otherwise, it returns a calculated value based on `m`, `a`, and `b`. The function handles various edge cases, including non-negative integers and positive integers for the input parameters, and it covers different scenarios based on the return value of `func_1(a, b)` and the comparison between `m` and the sum of `a` and `b` minus 1. The overall behavior of the function is to calculate and return a specific value based on the given input parameters and conditions, considering all potential cases and edge cases.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
