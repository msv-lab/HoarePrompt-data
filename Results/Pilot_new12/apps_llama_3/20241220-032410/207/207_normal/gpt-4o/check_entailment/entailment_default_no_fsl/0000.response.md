Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the problem description. It calculates the sum of all distinct integers the frog can reach for each position from 0 to m, considering the constraints of the frog's jumps.

The code first calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the `func_1` function. If the GCD is not 1, it recursively calls `func_2` with modified parameters and multiplies the result by the GCD.

If the GCD is 1, it checks if m is less than the sum of a and b minus 1. If this condition is met, it returns the sum of the first m+1 positive integers. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of the distinct integers the frog can reach for each position from 0 to m.

The code handles various edge cases, including non-negative integers and positive integers for the input parameters, and it covers different scenarios based on the return value of `func_1(a, b)` and the comparison between m and the sum of a and b minus 1.

The provided examples also match the expected output, which further supports the correctness of the code. For instance, the first example with m = 7, a = 5, and b = 3 returns 19, which is the correct sum of the distinct integers the frog can reach for each position from 0 to 7.

Overall, based on the provided code and examples, it appears that the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases.
