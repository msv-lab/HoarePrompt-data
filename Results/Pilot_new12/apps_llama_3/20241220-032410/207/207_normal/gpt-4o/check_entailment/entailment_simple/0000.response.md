Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach from position 0 to position m.

Here's why it works:

1. If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is not 1, then the program reduces the problem to a smaller instance where `a` and `b` are divided by their GCD, `g`. This is because the GCD represents the smallest unit of distance that the frog can move, and by dividing both `a` and `b` by `g`, the frog's movements can be scaled down. The result of the smaller instance is then multiplied by `g` to get the result for the original instance.

2. If the GCD of `a` and `b` is 1, then the program calculates the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach from position 0 to position `m`. 

   - If `m` is less than `a + b - 1`, then the frog can only reach positions 0, 1, 2,..., `m`, so the program returns the sum of the first `m + 1` positive integers.

   - If `m` is greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`, then the frog can reach all positions from 0 to `a + b - 1` (inclusive) and all positions from `a + b` to `m` (inclusive). The program calculates the sum of the number of distinct integers in these ranges and returns the result.

The program's logic is based on the fact that if the GCD of `a` and `b` is 1, the frog can reach all positions from 0 to `a + b - 1` and then all positions from `a + b` onwards. If the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1, the program scales down the problem to a smaller instance with GCD equal to 1. 

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the sum of the number of distinct integers the frog can reach from position 0 to position `m`, as described in the problem description.
