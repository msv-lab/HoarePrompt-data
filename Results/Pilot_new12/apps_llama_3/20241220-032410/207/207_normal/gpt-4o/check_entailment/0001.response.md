Correctness: **True**

The given program seems to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The problem can be divided into two cases: when the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is 1, and when it's not. 

2. If the GCD is not 1, we can divide both `a` and `b` by the GCD and the problem is reduced to the same problem with the new `a` and `b`. This is implemented in the `func_2` function.

3. If the GCD is 1, then the frog can reach all integers from 0 to `m`. The number of distinct integers the frog can reach is `m + 1` for `m < a + b - 1` and `m + 1` for `m >= a + b - 1` as well. This is also handled by the `func_2` function.

4. The function calculates the sum of `f(i)` from 0 to `m` using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series.

5. The examples provided also match the output of the program.

Since I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected, I believe the program is correct. The use of recursion to handle the case when the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1, and the use of the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of `f(i)` from 0 to `m` are key insights that make the program correct. 

However, one thing to note is that the function `func_1` calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, and `func_2` uses recursion to handle the case when the GCD is not 1. But since the recursion is based on dividing by the GCD, it will always terminate. 

In general, the program handles the problem in a mathematically sound way and the code is well-structured and clear. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
