Correctness: **True**.

The provided code implements a solution to the problem of calculating the sum of all distinct integers that a frog can reach within a given interval [0, m]. The code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, where `func_1` calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers and `func_2` calculates the desired sum.

The output hints for both functions agree with the code, and they provide insight into the functionality of each function. `func_1` correctly calculates the GCD of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, and `func_2` uses this GCD to determine the recursive approach for calculating the sum.

The code handles various cases based on the return value of `func_1` and the comparison between `m` and the sum of `a` and `b` minus 1. If the GCD is not 1, the function calls itself with modified parameters and multiplies the result by the GCD. If the GCD is 1, the function checks if `m` is less than the sum of `a` and `b` minus 1 and returns the sum of the first `m+1` positive integers if true. Otherwise, it returns a calculated value based on `m`, `a`, and `b`.

The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the code. For instance, when `m = 7`, `a = 5`, and `b = 3`, the code correctly calculates the sum of distinct integers that the frog can reach within the interval [0, 7], resulting in a sum of 19. Similarly, when `m = 1000000000`, `a = 1`, and `b = 2019`, the code correctly calculates the sum, resulting in a value of 500000001500000001.

Overall, the code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem, handling various cases and edge cases as described in the output hints. Since the code matches the problem description and the examples provided, and there are no obvious cases where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the code is **True**.
