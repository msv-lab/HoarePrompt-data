Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I have evaluated the program's correctness. The original assessment concluded that the program is correct, and I agree with this assessment.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's behavior and supports the original assessment. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The `func_2` function applies a recursive approach based on the GCD of `a` and `b` and handles different cases for `m`, `a`, and `b`.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly calculates the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`, where `f(x)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`. The program's behavior is consistent with the problem description, and the annotated version provides a clear understanding of the program's logic.

The original assessment is accurate because it correctly identifies the program's behavior and its consistency with the problem description. The assessment also highlights the program's ability to handle different cases and edge cases.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment, and my refined assessment is that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
