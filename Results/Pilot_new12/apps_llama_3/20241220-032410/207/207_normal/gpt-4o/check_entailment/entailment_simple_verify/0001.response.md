The original assessment seems to be accurate. The provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem. 

Here's a breakdown of the code's correctness based on the annotated version:

1. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm. The annotations provided for this function are accurate, and the function's behavior is consistent with the problem description.

2. The `func_2` function handles two cases: when the GCD of `a` and `b` is not 1, and when it is 1. If the GCD is not 1, the function recursively calls itself with `a` and `b` divided by the GCD, which reduces the problem to the same problem with the new `a` and `b`. This is a correct approach.

3. When the GCD of `a` and `b` is 1, the function calculates the sum of `f(i)` from 0 to `m` using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series. The annotations provided for this function are accurate, and the function's behavior is consistent with the problem description.

4. The main part of the code reads the input, calls `func_2` with the given values of `m`, `a`, and `b`, and prints the result. This is consistent with the problem description.

Based on the annotated version of the code, the original assessment's reasoning seems sound. The code correctly handles the cases when the GCD of `a` and `b` is 1 and when it's not, and the calculations for the sum of `f(i)` from 0 to `m` are correct. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** seems accurate.

Final: **True**
