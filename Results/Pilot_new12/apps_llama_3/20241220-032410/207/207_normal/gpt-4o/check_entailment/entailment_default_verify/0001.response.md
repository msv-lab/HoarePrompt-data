The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** seems to be accurate based on the provided problem description, code, and output hints. The program appears to correctly implement the logic for calculating the sum of distinct integers the frog can reach, considering the two cases where the GCD of `a` and `b` is 1 and where it's not.

The program's use of recursion to handle the case when the GCD is not 1, and the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series to calculate the sum of `f(i)` from 0 to `m`, aligns with the problem description. The examples provided also match the output of the program, further supporting its correctness.

The output hints for function `func_2` confirm that the function correctly handles various edge cases and scenarios based on the return value of `func_1(a, b)` and the comparison between `m` and the sum of `a` and `b` minus 1. The hints suggest that the function's recursive approach and calculations are in line with the problem requirements.

Given the information available, I refine the assessment of the program's correctness to be consistent with the original assessment. The program seems to be mathematically sound and well-structured, handling the problem in a correct and efficient manner.

Final: **True**
