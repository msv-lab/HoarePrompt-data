To evaluate the program's correctness, let's dive into the details provided by the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem asks for the sum of distinct integers a frog can reach from position 0 to `m`, with the ability to jump `a` or `-b` units at a time, without landing on integers outside the interval `[0, m]`.

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, primarily based on the following points:
1. The program correctly identifies two main cases: when the GCD of `a` and `b` is 1, and when it's not. 
2. For GCD not equal to 1, the program reduces the problem by dividing both `a` and `b` by their GCD, which is a sound mathematical approach.
3. When the GCD is 1, the frog can reach all integers from 0 to `m`, and the program calculates the sum of `f(i)` from 0 to `m` accordingly.
4. The use of recursion for handling the case when the GCD is not 1, and the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series for calculating the sum of `f(i)`.

Upon examining the annotated version of the code, the explanation of the states before and after each function call and block generally aligns with the original assessment. The annotations clarify the process of calculating the GCD and how the function `func_2` handles different scenarios based on the GCD and the relationship between `m` and `a + b - 1`.

However, the key to assessing the program's correctness lies in understanding the mathematical problem it's trying to solve and whether the code accurately implements a solution to that problem.

The provided code and annotations support the conclusion that the program is mathematically sound:
- It correctly calculates the GCD of `a` and `b`, which is crucial for determining the reachability of integers within the interval `[0, m]`.
- The recursive approach for `g!= 1` effectively reduces the problem to a simpler instance, leveraging the mathematical property that the GCD of `a` and `b` can be used to normalize the jumping intervals.
- For `g == 1`, the calculation of the sum of distinct integers reachable by the frog within the given constraints appears to follow a logical and mathematically valid approach.

Despite the rigorous breakdown provided by both the original assessment and the annotated code, the correctness ultimately hinges on whether these mathematical insights and the code's implementation accurately solve the stated problem.

Given the information and the analyses provided:
- The original assessment correctly identifies the key elements and reasoning behind the code's approach to solving the problem.
- The annotated code further clarifies the states and logic behind each step, supporting the mathematical validity of the approach.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, there is no clear indication that the original assessment is inaccurate. The reasoning and explanations provided in both support the conclusion that the program is a correct implementation of a solution to the given problem.

**Final: True**
