#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are non-negative integers.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `y` is 0, `x` is the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original `x` and `y`.
    return x
    #The program returns the absolute value of the original x, which is the GCD of the original x and 0 (y)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, x and y, where both are non-negative integers. It calculates and returns the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original x and y, effectively reducing y to 0 and x to their GCD through a series of replacements. Notably, when y becomes 0, the function returns the value of x, which is the GCD of the original two numbers. However, there is a discrepancy between the code's actual behavior and the annotations: the function does not return the absolute value of the original x, but rather the GCD of the original x and y. The GCD operation inherently produces a non-negative result because the inputs x and y are specified as non-negative integers. If y is originally 0, the function will simply return the value of x, as there are no further iterations of the while loop. In all cases, the function's output is the GCD of the two input integers, not their absolute values or any modification thereof beyond finding the GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: m is a non-negative integer, and a and b are positive integers, representing the maximum position on the number line, and the two possible jump intervals, respectively.
def func_2(m, a, b):
    g = func_1(a, b)
    if (g != 1) :
        return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
        #The program returns the result of func_2 applied to (m // g, a // g, b // g) multiplied by g, where g = func_1(a, b) and is a positive integer not equal to 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to `func_1(a, b)`, and `g` is equal to 1
    k = a + b - 1
    if (m < k) :
        return (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
        #The program returns the sum of the first m+1 positive integers, where m is a non-negative integer, the value is (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to `func_1(a, b)` and `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`
    sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
    sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
    return sum_k + sum_m
    #The program returns the value of `(a + b - 1) + m * (m + 1) // 2`, where `a` and `b` are positive integers, `m` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_2` calculates a value based on the input parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `m` is a non-negative integer and `a` and `b` are positive integers. The function applies a recursive approach, using the result of another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the next steps. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a value not equal to 1, the function calls itself with modified parameters and multiplies the result by the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. If `func_1(a, b)` returns 1, the function then checks if `m` is less than the sum of `a` and `b` minus 1. If this condition is met, it returns the sum of the first `m+1` positive integers. Otherwise, it returns a calculated value based on `m`, `a`, and `b`. The function handles various edge cases, including non-negative integers and positive integers for the input parameters, and it covers different scenarios based on the return value of `func_1(a, b)` and the comparison between `m` and the sum of `a` and `b` minus 1. The overall behavior of the function is to calculate and return a specific value based on the given input parameters and conditions, considering all potential cases and edge cases.
