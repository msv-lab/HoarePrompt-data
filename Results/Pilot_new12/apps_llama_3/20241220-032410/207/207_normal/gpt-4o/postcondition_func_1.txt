Functionality: The function `func_2` calculates a value based on the input parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`, where `m` is a non-negative integer and `a` and `b` are positive integers. The function applies a recursive approach, using the result of another function `func_1(a, b)` to determine the next steps. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a value not equal to 1, the function calls itself with modified parameters and multiplies the result by the return value of `func_1(a, b)`. If `func_1(a, b)` returns 1, the function then checks if `m` is less than the sum of `a` and `b` minus 1. If this condition is met, it returns the sum of the first `m+1` positive integers. Otherwise, it returns a calculated value based on `m`, `a`, and `b`. The function handles various edge cases, including non-negative integers and positive integers for the input parameters, and it covers different scenarios based on the return value of `func_1(a, b)` and the comparison between `m` and the sum of `a` and `b` minus 1. The overall behavior of the function is to calculate and return a specific value based on the given input parameters and conditions, considering all potential cases and edge cases.
