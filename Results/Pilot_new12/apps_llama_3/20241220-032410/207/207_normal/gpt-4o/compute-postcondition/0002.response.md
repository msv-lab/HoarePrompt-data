To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

Given:
- `m` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `g` is equal to `func_1(a, b)`, and `g` is not equal to 1.

The code snippet returns the result of `func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g)` multiplied by `g`.

Since we don't have the definitions of `func_1` and `func_2`, we can't directly compute the values. However, we can describe the nature of the return value based on the given information:

- `m // g` involves integer division of a non-negative integer `m` by `g`, where `g` is a positive integer not equal to 1 (since `g` equals `func_1(a, b)` and is not 1).
- `a // g` and `b // g` similarly involve integer division of positive integers `a` and `b` by `g`.
- The result of `func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g)` is then multiplied by `g`.

The output state will be the result of this multiplication, where:
- The input to `func_2` are the results of integer divisions by `g`, which is the result of `func_1(a, b)` and is not equal to 1.
- `g` itself is a positive integer not equal to 1, derived from `func_1(a, b)`.

Given the lack of specific definitions for `func_1` and `func_2`, we cannot compute an exact numerical value. However, we can state that the program returns the result of `func_2` applied to the integer divisions of `m`, `a`, and `b` by `g`, then scaled by `g`.

Output State: **The program returns the result of func_2 applied to (m // g, a // g, b // g) multiplied by g, where g = func_1(a, b) and is a positive integer not equal to 1.**
