The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `m`, `a`, and `b`. `m` is a non-negative integer, and `a` and `b` are positive integers. The return value of the function depends on the following cases:

1. If the first case is fulfilled, the function returns the result of `func_2` applied to `(m // g, a // g, b // g)` multiplied by `g`, where `g` is a positive integer not equal to 1, calculated by `func_1(a, b)`.

2. If the second case is fulfilled, the function returns the sum of the first `m+1` positive integers, calculated as `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2`.

3. If the third case is fulfilled, the function returns the value of `(a + b - 1) + m * (m + 1) // 2`, where `m` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a non-negative integer `m` and positive integers `a` and `b`, and return a value based on the specified cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters m, a, and b, where m is a non-negative integer and a and b are positive integers, and returns a value based on three cases: the result of func_2 applied to (m // g, a // g, b // g) multiplied by g, the sum of the first m+1 positive integers, or the value of (a + b - 1) + m * (m + 1) // 2, depending on the fulfillment of each case.**
