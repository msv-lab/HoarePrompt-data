To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state of the variables.


The initial state is: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to `func_1(a, b)` and `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.


Now, let's analyze the code:


`sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2`


This line of code calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers and assigns it to the variable `sum_k`.


The value of `k` is `a + b - 1`. Substituting this into the equation for `sum_k`, we get:


`sum_k = (a + b - 1) * ((a + b - 1) + 1) // 2`


Simplifying this expression, we get:


`sum_k = (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`


The states of the other variables are not affected. 


The value of `g` is still equal to `func_1(a, b)` and `g` is still equal to 1, `m` is still greater than or equal to `k`.


Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to `func_1(a, b)` and `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`.
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to `func_1(a, b)` and `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, and `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`.**
