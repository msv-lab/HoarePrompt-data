The value of `k` is assigned the value of `a + b - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. `m` is still a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are still positive integers, `g` is still equal to `func_1(a, b)` and `g` is still equal to 1. 
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to `func_1(a, b)` and `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`**
