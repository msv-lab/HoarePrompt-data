To determine the output state, we must understand the impact of the code on the variables. The code `g = func_1(a, b)` assigns the result of the function `func_1(a, b)` to the variable `g`. 

However, without knowing the specifics of what `func_1(a, b)` does, we can only describe the output state in terms of the function's result. 

The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers representing possible jump intervals. The initial state also mentions `m`, a non-negative integer representing the maximum position on the number line, but `m` is not directly involved in the assignment to `g`.

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state will include the initial conditions for `m`, `a`, and `b`, with the addition of `g` being equal to the result of `func_1(a, b)`. 

Since we do not have the definition of `func_1(a, b)`, we cannot provide a specific value or expression for `g` beyond stating it is the result of this function call.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, and `g` is equal to `func_1(a, b)`.**
