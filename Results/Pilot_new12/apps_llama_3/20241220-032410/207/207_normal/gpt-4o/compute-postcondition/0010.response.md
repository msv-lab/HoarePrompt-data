To calculate the return value, we need to understand the components of `sum_k` and `sum_m` and how they are combined.

- `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`.
- `sum_k` equals `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `k` natural numbers, where `k = a + b - 1`.
- `m` is a non-negative integer and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- `sum_m` equals `m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2`, which can be interpreted as the sum of the first `m` natural numbers minus the sum of the first `a + b - 2` natural numbers.

Given these definitions, let's break down the return statement:

`return sum_k + sum_m`

Substituting the given expressions for `sum_k` and `sum_m`:

`return (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 + m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2`

Simplifying the expression by combining like terms:

`return (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2 + m * (m + 1) // 2`

`return (a + b - 1) * ((a + b) - (a + b - 2)) // 2 + m * (m + 1) // 2`

`return (a + b - 1) * 2 // 2 + m * (m + 1) // 2`

`return (a + b - 1) + m * (m + 1) // 2`

This expression represents the sum of `a + b - 1` (which equals `k`) and the sum of the first `m` natural numbers. Given that `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, and knowing the values of `a`, `b`, and `m` are positive integers (with `a` and `b` being strictly positive and `m` being non-negative), the return value combines these elements to produce a result that depends on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `m`.

Output State: **The program returns the value of `(a + b - 1) + m * (m + 1) // 2`, where `a` and `b` are positive integers, `m` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to `a + b - 1`.**
