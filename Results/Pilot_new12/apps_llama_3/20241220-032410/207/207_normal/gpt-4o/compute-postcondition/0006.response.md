The given code returns the value of the expression `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2`. Here, `m` is a non-negative integer. 

The formula `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2` is a well-known formula for the sum of the first `m+1` positive integers, where the last integer in the sum is `m+1`. 

Given `m` is non-negative, the minimum value `m` can take is 0. When `m` is 0, the formula evaluates to `(0 + 1) * (0 + 2) // 2 = 1 * 2 // 2 = 1`. 

As `m` increases, the value of the formula also increases. Since `m` is non-negative, `(m + 1)` and `(m + 2)` will always be positive integers greater than `m`.

Other variables `a`, `b`, `g`, `k` and function `func_1(a, b)` do not affect the calculation of the return value.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of the first m+1 positive integers, where m is a non-negative integer, the value is (m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2**
