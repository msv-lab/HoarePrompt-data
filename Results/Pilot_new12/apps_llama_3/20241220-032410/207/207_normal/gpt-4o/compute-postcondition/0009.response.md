To calculate the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and apply the provided Python code.

Given the initial state:
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `a` and `b` are positive integers
- `g` is equal to `func_1(a, b)` and `g` is equal to 1
- `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`
- `m` is greater than or equal to `k`
- `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`

And the Python code:
```python
sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of this code:
- The value of `sum_m` is calculated based on `m` and `k`.
- Since `m` is a non-negative integer and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, the expression `m * (m + 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `m` positive integers.
- The expression `k * (k - 1) // 2` calculates the sum of the first `k-1` positive integers.
- Thus, `sum_m` is essentially the sum of integers from `k` to `m`, inclusive.

Considering the initial state and the calculation:
- `g` remains equal to 1.
- `k` remains equal to `a + b - 1`.
- `sum_k` remains equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`.
- `sum_m` is now equal to `m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2`, which can be further simplified as `m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`m` is a non-negative integer and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`, and `sum_m` is equal to `m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2`.
Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer and `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`, and `sum_m` is equal to `m * (m + 1) // 2 - (a + b - 1) * (a + b - 2) // 2**
