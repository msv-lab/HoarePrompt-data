The given code initializes a list `dp` of size `m + 1` with all elements set to 0. 

The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are not changed by this code snippet, so they remain input integers.

`dp` is assigned the value of a list of `m + 1` zeros.

Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros**
