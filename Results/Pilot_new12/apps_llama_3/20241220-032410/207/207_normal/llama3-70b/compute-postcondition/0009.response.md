Postcondition: **`m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1, if `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i]` is `dp[i] + dp[i - b]`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or 1 or 2 if initially 1 and `dp[i-b]` equals 1, otherwise the values of `dp` remain unchanged, `i` is the current value.**
