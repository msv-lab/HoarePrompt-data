The value of `dp[i + a]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`. The initial value of `dp[i]` is 1 because `dp[0]` is 1 and `i` is 0. The value of `dp[i + a]` is initially 0 because all elements of `dp` except `dp[0]` are zeros.

Output State: **`m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1 and the rest of the elements are zeros except `dp[a]`, `i` is 0.**
