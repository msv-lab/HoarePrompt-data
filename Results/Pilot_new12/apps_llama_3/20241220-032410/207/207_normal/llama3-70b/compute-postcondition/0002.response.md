The code assigns 1 to the first element of the list `dp`. The initial state of `dp` is a list of `m + 1` zeros, so after the assignment, `dp` will be a list where the first element is 1 and the rest are zeros. The values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest of the elements are zeros**
