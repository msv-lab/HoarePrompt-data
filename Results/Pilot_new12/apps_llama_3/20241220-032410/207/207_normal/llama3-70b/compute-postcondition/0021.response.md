The given code snippet prints the sum of all elements in the list `dp`. The list `dp` represents the number of ways to reach each index from 0 by either adding `a` or subtracting `b`. 

The initial state is: `m`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach index `i` from 0 by either adding `a` or subtracting `b`, with `dp[0]` being 1.

Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach index `i` from 0 by either adding `a` or subtracting `b`, with `dp[0]` being 1, and the sum of all elements in `dp` has been printed as output, the printed value is equal to `sum(dp)`.**
