The value of `dp[i + a]` is incremented by `dp[i]`, where `dp[i]` is either 0, 1, or 2. `m` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1, if `i + 1 - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1]` is `dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 1 - b]`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or 1 or 2 if initially 1 and `dp[i + 1 - b]` equals 1, otherwise the values of `dp` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`. 

The state of `i` remains `i + 1` and `m`, `a`, `b` remain unchanged. 

The value of `dp[i + a]` becomes `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`. 

So, `dp[i + a]` can become 1 or 2 if `dp[i]` equals 1 and `dp[i + a]` initially equals 1 or 0, or `dp[i + a]` can become 2 if `dp[i]` equals 1 and `dp[i + a]` initially equals 1, or `dp[i + a]` can become 1 if `dp[i]` equals 1 and `dp[i + a]` initially equals 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1, if `i + 1 - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1]` is `dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 1 - b]`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or 1 or 2 if initially 1 and `dp[i + 1 - b]` equals 1, otherwise the values of `dp` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, and `dp[i + a]` is `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`.

Output State: **`m` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1, if `i + 1 - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1]` is `dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 1 - b]`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or 1 or 2 if initially 1 and `dp[i + 1 - b]` equals 1, otherwise the values of `dp` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, and `dp[i + a]` is `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`**
