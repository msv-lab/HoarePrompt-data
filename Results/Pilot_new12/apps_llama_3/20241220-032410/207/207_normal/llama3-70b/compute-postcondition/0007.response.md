Postcondition: **`m` is an integer and must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[a]` is 1 and the rest of the elements are zeros except `dp[0]` and `dp[a]`, `i` is 0. The current value of `i` is greater than or equal to `b`, since `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0.**
