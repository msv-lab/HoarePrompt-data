It appears there are no parameters provided for the function `func`. However, based on the constraints given for `m`, `a`, and `b`, it seems these variables should be parameters of the function. Assuming that is the case, let's proceed with the understanding that the function should be defined with these parameters.


The function `func` accepts parameters `m`, `a`, and `b`. `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers where `1 <= m <= 10^9` and `1 <= a, b <= 10^5`. Since the specific return values or conditions for these parameters are not provided in the problem, I will describe the functionality based on the given constraints and the assumption that the function utilizes these parameters in its operation.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters m, a, and b, which are integers within specific ranges, and processes them to produce an outcome based on their values.**
