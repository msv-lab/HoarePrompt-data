According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current value, `m` is greater than or equal to `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is `i + 1` and for the loop to execute again `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `m`.
State: **`m` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1, if `i + 1 - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1]` is `dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 1 - b]`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or 1 or 2 if initially 1 and `dp[i + 1 - b]` equals 1, otherwise the values of `dp` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`**
