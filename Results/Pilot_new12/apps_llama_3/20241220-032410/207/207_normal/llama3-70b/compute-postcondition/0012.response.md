Postcondition: **`m` is an integer and must be greater than `i`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1, if `i + 1 - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1]` is `dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 1 - b]`, and the rest of the elements are either 0 or 1 or 2 if initially 1 and `dp[i + 1 - b]` equals 1, otherwise the values of `dp` remain unchanged, `i` is `i + 1`, and if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + a]` is `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`.**
