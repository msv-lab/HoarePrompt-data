To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `m` is an integer greater than `i + 1`
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where:
  - `dp[0]` is 1
  - `dp[a]` is 1
  - If `i + 1 - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1]` is `dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 1 - b]`
  - If `i + 2 - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i + 2]` is `dp[i + 2] + dp[i + 2 - b]`
  - If `i + 1 + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + 1 + a]` is `dp[i + 1 + a] + dp[i + 1]`
  - Otherwise, the values of `dp` remain unchanged
- `i` is `i + 1`

The code snippet is:
```python
dp[i + a] += dp[i]
```

This line of code increments the value of `dp` at index `i + a` by the value of `dp` at index `i`. 

Given the initial state, let's update the values according to the code snippet.

- `m` remains an integer greater than `i + 1`
- `a` and `b` are still input integers
- `dp` remains a list of length `m + 1` with the updated values:
  - `dp[0]` is 1
  - `dp[a]` is 1
  - The previous conditions for `dp[i + 1]`, `dp[i + 2]`, and `dp[i + 1 + a]` still apply
  - `dp[i + a]` is now `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`
- `i` is still `i + 1`

So, the output state after executing the given code snippet is:
- `m` is an integer greater than `i + 1`
- `a` and `b` are input integers
- `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where:
  - `dp[0]` is 1
  - `dp[a]` is 1
  - If `i + 1 - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1]` is `dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 1 - b]`
  - If `i + 2 - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i + 2]` is `dp[i + 2] + dp[i + 2 - b]`
  - If `i + 1 + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + 1 + a]` is `dp[i + 1 + a] + dp[i + 1]`
  - `dp[i + a]` is `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`
- `i` is `i + 1`

Output State: **`m` is an integer greater than `i + 1`, `a` and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1, if `i + 1 - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i + 1]` is `dp[i + 1] + dp[i + 1 - b]`, if `i + 2 - b` is greater than or equal to 0, then `dp[i + 2]` is `dp[i + 2] + dp[i + 2 - b]`, if `i + 1 + a` is less than or equal to `m`, then `dp[i + 1 + a]` is `dp[i + 1 + a] + dp[i + 1]`, and `dp[i + a]` is `dp[i + a] + dp[i]`, and `i` is `i + 1`**
