Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` through user input, where `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `1 <= m <= 10^9` and `1 <= a, b <= 10^5`. It calculates the number of ways to reach different indices from 0 by either adding `a` or subtracting `b`, and then prints the total sum of these ways. The function effectively counts the combinations of adding `a` and subtracting `b` to reach all possible indices up to `m`, handling edge cases where `i + a` exceeds `m` or `i - b` is less than 0. The final state of the program includes the user-input integers `m`, `a`, and `b`, a list `dp` of length `m + 1` containing the number of ways to reach each index, and the printed sum of these ways, providing a result based on the input values.**
