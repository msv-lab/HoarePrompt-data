The code `m, a, b = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `m`, `a`, and `b` by taking an input, splitting it into three parts, converting each part to an integer, and assigning them to `m`, `a`, and `b` respectively. 

The initial constraints on `m`, `a`, and `b` are that they are integers such that `1 <= m <= 10^9` and `1 <= a, b <= 10^5`. However, after executing the code, these constraints are no longer guaranteed because the new values of `m`, `a`, and `b` are determined by the input.

If we assume that the input is provided in the format of three space-separated integers, then `m`, `a`, and `b` will be assigned the values of these three integers. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `m`, `a`, and `b` are input integers.
Output State: **`m`, `a`, and `b` are input integers**
