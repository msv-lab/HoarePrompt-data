Correctness: **False**

The given program attempts to solve the problem by using dynamic programming (DP) to calculate the number of ways to reach each position from 0. However, there is a crucial issue with the implementation.

The problem statement asks for the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from 0 to `m`, where `f(i)` is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, i]`. The program's DP approach is trying to calculate `f(i)` by considering the number of ways to reach each position `i` by either adding `a` or subtracting `b`.

The issue lies in the fact that the program does not correctly calculate `f(i)`. The current implementation only considers the number of ways to reach each position `i` by adding `a` or subtracting `b`, but it does not guarantee that the frog never jumps outside the interval `[0, i]`.

To correctly calculate `f(i)`, the program should consider the reachable positions within the interval `[0, i]` and ensure that the frog never jumps outside this interval. The current implementation does not achieve this, leading to incorrect results.

For example, consider the input `m = 7, a = 5, b = 3`. The program will calculate `dp` values as follows:

- `dp[0] = 1`
- `dp[5] = dp[0] = 1` (because we can reach 5 by adding 5 to 0)
- `dp[2] = dp[-1] = 0` (because we cannot reach -1, so `dp[2]` will not be updated)
- `dp[7] = dp[2] = 0` (because we can reach 7 by adding 5 to 2, but `dp[2]` is 0)

However, the correct `f(7)` should be 8, not 0. This is because the frog can reach positions 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 by making the following jumps: +5, -3, +5, -3, +5, -3, +5, -3 (note that some of these jumps may be redundant).

Therefore, the given program does not correctly implement the problem description, and its results may not match the expected output. A correct solution would require a more sophisticated approach to calculate `f(i)` while ensuring that the frog never jumps outside the interval `[0, i]`. 

In the given program, the line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` can cause the frog to jump outside the interval `[0, i]`, which is not allowed according to the problem description. This line should be modified to only consider jumps that stay within the interval `[0, i]`.

Additionally, the line `dp[i + a] += dp[i]` only updates the `dp` value for the position `i + a`, but it does not consider the fact that the frog can reach position `i + a` from other positions as well.

To correctly calculate `f(i)`, the program should use a more sophisticated DP approach that takes into account all possible jumps that stay within the interval `[0, i]`. This would require a more complex update rule for the `dp` values, as well as additional checks to ensure that the frog never jumps outside the allowed interval.

Here's a high-level idea of how a correct solution could be implemented:

1. Initialize a DP table `dp` of size `m + 1`, where `dp[i]` will store the number of distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, i]`.
2. Set `dp[0] = 1`, since the frog can always reach position 0.
3. Iterate over each position `i` from 1 to `m`. For each position `i`, consider all possible jumps that stay within the interval `[0, i]`. Update the `dp` value for position `i` based on the number of distinct integers the frog can reach from the previous positions.
4. To calculate the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from 0 to `m`, simply sum up the values in the `dp` table.

Here's a possible implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    reachable = set([0])
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        new_reachable = set()
        for pos in reachable:
            if pos + a <= i:
                new_reachable.add(pos + a)
            if pos - b >= 0 and pos - b <= i:
                new_reachable.add(pos - b)
        reachable = reachable.union(new_reachable)
        dp[i] = len(reachable)
    
    print(sum(dp))

```
This implementation uses a set `reachable` to keep track of the distinct integers the frog can reach within the interval `[0, i]`. The `dp` table is updated based on the size of the `reachable` set for each position `i`. The sum of `f(i)` for `i` from 0 to `m` is calculated by summing up the values in the `dp` table.
