Correctness: **False**

The given program is intended to calculate the sum of distinct integers that a frog can reach from position 0 to position m, where the frog can either jump to position k+a or k-b.

However, the provided program has an issue. The problem statement defines f(x) as the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval [0, x]. The given program does not correctly calculate this.

The issue lies in the lines where the program updates the dp array. The program adds dp[i] to dp[i + a] when i + a is within the bounds, which is correct. However, when the program adds dp[i - b] to dp[i], it does not consider the fact that the frog should never jump on an integer outside the interval [0, x].

The correct approach would be to use a set to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached. For each i from 0 to m, we should update the set with all reachable positions from i by either adding a or subtracting b, without exceeding the upper bound m.

Here is a corrected version of the code in Python:
```python
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    total_sum = 0
    for x in range(m + 1):
        reachable = set()
        queue = [0]
        while queue:
            pos = queue.pop(0)
            if pos not in reachable and 0 <= pos <= x:
                reachable.add(pos)
                if pos + a <= x:
                    queue.append(pos + a)
                if pos - b >= 0:
                    queue.append(pos - b)
        total_sum += len(reachable)
    print(total_sum)
```
This version of the code correctly calculates the sum of distinct integers that the frog can reach for each position from 0 to m, without exceeding the upper bound m. It uses a set to keep track of the distinct reachable positions and a queue to perform a breadth-first search.

The original program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not correctly calculate the number of distinct integers that can be reached. Therefore, the correctness of the original program is False.
