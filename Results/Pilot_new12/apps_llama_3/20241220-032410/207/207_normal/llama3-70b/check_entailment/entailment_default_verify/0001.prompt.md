You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
Program:
```
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
    print(sum(dp))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The issue lies in the way it handles the calculation of `f(x)`.

The condition `if i - b >= 0: dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is incorrect. This condition is trying to simulate the frog jumping backwards by adding the number of distinct integers that can be reached from the previous position `i - b`. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the constraint that the frog cannot jump outside the interval `[0, x]`.

A correct approach would be to use a separate data structure, such as a set, to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached from each position. The program should then iterate over each position from `0` to `m` and calculate `f(x)` by checking which integers can be reached from that position.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input: `7 5 3`

The program's output will not be `19` as expected, because it does not correctly calculate `f(5)`, `f(6)`, and `f(7)`.

To fix this issue, a correct implementation would involve using a more sophisticated approach, such as using dynamic programming with a separate data structure to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached from each position. 

Here's a high-level idea of how the correct implementation could look like:
```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    total_sum = 0
    for x in range(m + 1):
        reachable = set()
        stack = [0]
        while stack:
            pos = stack.pop()
            if pos not in reachable and 0 <= pos <= x:
                reachable.add(pos)
                if pos + a <= x:
                    stack.append(pos + a)
                if pos - b >= 0:
                    stack.append(pos - b)
        total_sum += len(reachable)
    print(total_sum)
```
This implementation correctly calculates the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m` by iterating over each position and using a set to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached from that position.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` through user input, where `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `1 <= m <= 10^9` and `1 <= a, b <= 10^5`. It calculates the number of ways to reach different indices from 0 by either adding `a` or subtracting `b`, and then prints the total sum of these ways. The function effectively counts the combinations of adding `a` and subtracting `b` to reach all possible indices up to `m`, handling edge cases where `i + a` exceeds `m` or `i - b` is less than 0. The final state of the program includes the user-input integers `m`, `a`, and `b`, a list `dp` of length `m + 1` containing the number of ways to reach each index, and the printed sum of these ways, providing a result based on the input values.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
