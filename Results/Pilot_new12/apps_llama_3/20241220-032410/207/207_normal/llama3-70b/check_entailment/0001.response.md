Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The issue lies in the way it handles the calculation of `f(x)`.

The condition `if i - b >= 0: dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is incorrect. This condition is trying to simulate the frog jumping backwards by adding the number of distinct integers that can be reached from the previous position `i - b`. However, this approach is flawed because it does not consider the constraint that the frog cannot jump outside the interval `[0, x]`.

A correct approach would be to use a separate data structure, such as a set, to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached from each position. The program should then iterate over each position from `0` to `m` and calculate `f(x)` by checking which integers can be reached from that position.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input: `7 5 3`

The program's output will not be `19` as expected, because it does not correctly calculate `f(5)`, `f(6)`, and `f(7)`.

To fix this issue, a correct implementation would involve using a more sophisticated approach, such as using dynamic programming with a separate data structure to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached from each position. 

Here's a high-level idea of how the correct implementation could look like:
```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    total_sum = 0
    for x in range(m + 1):
        reachable = set()
        stack = [0]
        while stack:
            pos = stack.pop()
            if pos not in reachable and 0 <= pos <= x:
                reachable.add(pos)
                if pos + a <= x:
                    stack.append(pos + a)
                if pos - b >= 0:
                    stack.append(pos - b)
        total_sum += len(reachable)
    print(total_sum)
```
This implementation correctly calculates the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m` by iterating over each position and using a set to keep track of the distinct integers that can be reached from that position.
