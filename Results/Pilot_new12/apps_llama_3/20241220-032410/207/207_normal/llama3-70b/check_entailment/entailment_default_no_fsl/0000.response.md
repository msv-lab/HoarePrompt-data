Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle all cases correctly. It incorrectly calculates the `f(i)` values by considering all jumps, including those that go beyond the current index `i`. The problem description specifies that `f(x)` should count the distinct integers that can be reached without jumping outside the interval `[0, x]`. However, the program's dynamic programming approach does not enforce this constraint properly.

For example, when calculating `f(i)`, the program includes jumps that go beyond `i`, which is incorrect. The program should only consider jumps that stay within the interval `[0, i]`.

A correct approach would involve using a different data structure, such as a set, to store the reachable indices within the interval `[0, i]`, and updating this set iteratively based on the allowed jumps. This would ensure that only valid jumps are considered when calculating `f(i)`.

The provided code does not account for this constraint, leading to incorrect results for some inputs. Therefore, the program is incorrect, and its correctness is **False**. 

To fix this issue, the code needs to be revised to properly enforce the constraint that jumps should not go outside the interval `[0, x]`. One possible solution is to maintain a set of reachable indices for each `i` and update this set based on the allowed jumps, ensuring that only valid jumps are considered.

Here's a revised version of the code in Python that correctly calculates the `f(i)` values:

```python
def func():
    (m, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(m + 1):
        reachable = set()
        queue = [0]
        while queue:
            curr = queue.pop(0)
            if curr not in reachable and 0 <= curr <= i:
                reachable.add(curr)
                if curr + a <= i:
                    queue.append(curr + a)
                if curr - b >= 0:
                    queue.append(curr - b)
        total_sum += len(reachable)
    print(total_sum)

func()
```
