Correctness: **False**.

The given code does not accurately solve the problem as described. The issue lies in the fact that the dynamic programming (DP) table `dp` is being updated incorrectly. Specifically, the line `dp[i] += dp[i - b]` is problematic. 

When `i - b` is within the valid range, this line adds the number of ways to reach `i - b` to the number of ways to reach `i`. However, this update is incorrect because it double-counts some paths. A correct approach would involve only considering the number of distinct integers that can be reached up to each point `i`, not counting the paths themselves.

Moreover, the provided code does not correctly implement the logic to calculate `f(x)`, which is defined as the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval `[0, x]`. The current implementation does not ensure that the frog stays within the interval `[0, x]` for each `x` from `0` to `m`.

To accurately solve this problem, one would need to reconsider the approach to ensure that the frog's jumps are constrained within the interval `[0, x]` for each `x`, and that distinct reachable integers are correctly counted.

For example, consider the input `m = 7, a = 5, b = 3`. The given code does not correctly calculate `f(x)` for each `x` and then sum these values. A correct solution would involve ensuring that the frog's jumps do not exceed `x` for each `x`, and accurately counting distinct reachable integers within this constraint. 

Therefore, the provided code does not meet the problem's requirements for every potential case, leading to an incorrectness assessment.
