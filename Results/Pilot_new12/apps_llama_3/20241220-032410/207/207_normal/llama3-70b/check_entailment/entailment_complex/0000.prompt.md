You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: A frog is initially at position $0$ on the number line. The frog has two positive integers $a$ and $b$. From a position $k$, it can either jump to position $k+a$ or $k-b$.

Let $f(x)$ be the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval $[0, x]$. The frog doesn't need to visit all these integers in one trip, that is, an integer is counted if the frog can somehow reach it if it starts from $0$.

Given an integer $m$, find $\sum_{i=0}^{m} f(i)$. That is, find the sum of all $f(i)$ for $i$ from $0$ to $m$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers $m, a, b$ ($1 \leq m \leq 10^9, 1 \leq a,b \leq 10^5$).


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the desired sum.


-----Examples-----
Input
7 5 3

Output
19

Input
1000000000 1 2019

Output
500000001500000001

Input
100 100000 1

Output
101

Input
6 4 5

Output
10



-----Note-----

In the first example, we must find $f(0)+f(1)+\ldots+f(7)$. We have $f(0) = 1, f(1) = 1, f(2) = 1, f(3) = 1, f(4) = 1, f(5) = 3, f(6) = 3, f(7) = 8$. The sum of these values is $19$.

In the second example, we have $f(i) = i+1$, so we want to find $\sum_{i=0}^{10^9} i+1$.

In the third example, the frog can't make any jumps in any case.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: m, a, and b are integers such that 1 <= m <= 10^9 and 1 <= a, b <= 10^5.
def func():
    m, a, b = map(int, input().split())
    dp = [0] * (m + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    for i in range(m + 1):
        if i + a <= m:
            dp[i + a] += dp[i]
        
        if i - b >= 0:
            dp[i] += dp[i - b]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `m`, `a`, and `b` are input integers, `dp` is a list of length `m + 1` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach index `i` from 0 by either adding `a` or subtracting `b`, with `dp[0]` being 1.
    print(sum(dp))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` through user input, where `m`, `a`, and `b` are integers such that `1 <= m <= 10^9` and `1 <= a, b <= 10^5`. It calculates the number of ways to reach different indices from 0 by either adding `a` or subtracting `b`, and then prints the total sum of these ways. The function effectively counts the combinations of adding `a` and subtracting `b` to reach all possible indices up to `m`, handling edge cases where `i + a` exceeds `m` or `i - b` is less than 0. The final state of the program includes the user-input integers `m`, `a`, and `b`, a list `dp` of length `m + 1` containing the number of ways to reach each index, and the printed sum of these ways, providing a result based on the input values.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
