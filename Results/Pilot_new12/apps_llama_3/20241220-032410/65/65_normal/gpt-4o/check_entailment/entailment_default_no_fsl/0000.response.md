Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly solves the problem as described. It takes the number of balloons and friends as input, along with a string representing the colors of the balloons. It then counts the frequency of each color in the string and checks if any color appears more times than there are friends. If such a color is found, it means that it's impossible to distribute the balloons among the friends without any friend getting more than one balloon of the same color, so it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The code handles all the potential cases as described in the problem. For example, if the input is:
```
4 2
aabb
```
The code will correctly print 'YES', because the balloons can be distributed among the friends as follows: the first friend gets two 'a' balloons and the second friend gets two 'b' balloons.

Similarly, if the input is:
```
6 3
aacaab
```
The code will correctly print 'NO', because there are more 'a' balloons than there are friends, so at least one friend will have to get more than one 'a' balloon.

The code assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors, as stated in the problem description. Therefore, it does not need to handle cases where the input string is empty or the number of friends or balloons is zero or negative. 

The output hints provide examples of cases where the code works correctly, and there are no cases mentioned where the code does not work as expected. The code's logic is sound and it correctly solves the problem as described.
