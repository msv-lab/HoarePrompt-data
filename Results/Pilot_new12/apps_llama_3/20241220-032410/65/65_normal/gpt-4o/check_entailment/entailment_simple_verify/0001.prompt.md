You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
    if can_distribute:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and follows the problem description. It accurately determines whether Kefa can distribute all his balloons to his friends without making any of them upset.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1.  It first reads the input, `n` (the number of balloons) and `k` (the number of friends), and the string `s` representing the colors of the balloons.
2.  It creates a dictionary `color_count` to store the count of each color in the string `s`.
3.  It then checks if the count of any color is greater than `k`. If it is, it means that Kefa cannot distribute the balloons without making at least one friend upset, because there are more balloons of a particular color than friends. In this case, it sets `can_distribute` to `False` and breaks the loop.
4.  If the program hasn't found any color with a count greater than `k` after checking all colors, it means that Kefa can distribute the balloons without making any friends upset. In this case, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

*   When the number of balloons of each color is less than or equal to the number of friends.
*   When the number of balloons of a particular color is greater than the number of friends.
*   When there are no balloons (i.e., `n` is 0).

The program's logic is sound, and it produces the expected output for all the examples provided. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of balloons, k is a positive integer representing the number of friends, and s is a string of lowercase letters representing the colors of the balloons, where 1 <= n, k <= 100.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for color in s:
        if color in color_count:
            color_count[color] += 1
        else:
            color_count[color] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, and if `s` is not empty, `color` is the last character in `s`.
    can_distribute = True
    for count in color_count.values():
        if count > k:
            can_distribute = False
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `color` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, and `can_distribute` is `True` if all frequencies in `color_count` are less than or equal to `k`, and `False` otherwise.
    if can_distribute :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `color` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty. If `can_distribute` is `True`, 'YES' has been printed. If `can_distribute` is `False`, 'NO' has been printed to the console.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
