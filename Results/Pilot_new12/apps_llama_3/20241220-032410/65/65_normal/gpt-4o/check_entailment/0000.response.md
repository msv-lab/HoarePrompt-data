Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly solves the problem of distributing balloons to Kefa's friends such that no friend gets two balloons of the same color. The program first counts the occurrences of each balloon color, then checks if any color appears more times than there are friends. If such a color exists, it means that at least one friend will get two balloons of the same color, so the program prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. For example, if there are more friends than balloons, the program will still print 'YES' because each friend can get at most one balloon of each color. If there are more balloons than friends and all balloons have different colors, the program will still print 'NO' because at least one friend will get two balloons of the same color.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, so I conclude that the program is correct.
