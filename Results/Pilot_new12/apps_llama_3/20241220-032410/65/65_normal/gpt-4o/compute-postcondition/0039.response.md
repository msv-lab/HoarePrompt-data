Functionality: **The function determines whether it's possible to distribute balloons of different colors among a given number of friends, such that no friend gets more than one balloon of the same color. It accepts three inputs: the number of balloons, the number of friends, and a string of colors representing each balloon. The function then prints 'YES' if the distribution is possible and 'NO' otherwise. The final state of the program includes the input parameters, a dictionary containing the frequency of each color, and a printed message indicating whether the distribution is possible. The function does not handle cases where the input string or the number of friends/balloons is empty, and it assumes that the input string only contains lowercase letters. The function also does not consider the actual distribution of balloons among friends, but only checks if such a distribution is theoretically possible.**
