Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` with at least one key-value pair, `color` is the last character in `s`. If the frequency of the first character in `s` is higher than `k`, then `can_distribute` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
