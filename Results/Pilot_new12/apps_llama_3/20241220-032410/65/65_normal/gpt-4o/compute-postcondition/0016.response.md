Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string with at least 3 characters, `color` is the third character in `s`. If `color` is already in `color_count`, then `color_count[color]` is the previous count of `color` plus 1. If `color` is not in `color_count`, then `color_count[color]` is set to 1.**
