Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` with at least one key-value pair, `color` is the last character in `s`, initially `can_distribute` was `True`, and the current value of `can_distribute` is still `True`, `count` is the frequency of the first character in `s`, and the current value of `count` is higher than `k`**
