The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The states of the variables `n`, `k`, `s`, `color_count`, and `color` are not affected. The value of `can_distribute` remains `False`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` with at least two key-value pairs, `color` is the last character in `s`, `can_distribute` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
