Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` with at least two key-value pairs, `color` is the last character in `s`. If `count` is greater than `k`, then `can_distribute` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
