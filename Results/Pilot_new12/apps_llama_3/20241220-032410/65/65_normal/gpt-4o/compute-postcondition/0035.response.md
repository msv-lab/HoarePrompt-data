Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s`, `color` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, and `can_distribute` is `False` because not all frequencies in `color_count` are less than or equal to `k`**
