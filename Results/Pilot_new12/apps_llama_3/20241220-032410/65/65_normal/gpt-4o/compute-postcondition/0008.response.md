Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string with at least 1 character, `color` is the first character in `s`. If `color` is already a key in `color_count`, then `color_count[color]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `color_count` is updated with `color` as a key and 1 as its value.**
