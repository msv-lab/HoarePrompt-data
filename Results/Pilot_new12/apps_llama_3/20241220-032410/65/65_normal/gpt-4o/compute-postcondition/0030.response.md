The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a non-empty input string, `color_count` is a dictionary containing the frequency of each character in `s` with at least two key-value pairs, `count` is the next value in `color_count`, `can_distribute` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
