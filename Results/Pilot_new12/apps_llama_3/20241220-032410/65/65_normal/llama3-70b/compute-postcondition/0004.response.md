Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `color_count` is a dictionary that initially was empty, `c` is the first character in the string. The current value of `c` is a key in the `color_count` dictionary, meaning `c` has been encountered before and its count is being tracked in `color_count`.**
