Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the string `s`. If `c` is already a key in `color_count`, then the count of `c` in `color_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `c` is added as a key to `color_count` with a count of 1.***
