The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` by taking new input values from the user, converting them to integers, and assigning them to `n` and `k`, respectively. 

The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of balloons, `k` is a positive integer representing the number of friends, and `s` is a string of lowercase letters representing the color of each balloon. However, since the given code snippet only updates `n` and `k` based on user input, the value of `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a string of lowercase letters**
