Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the original input string, `c` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is the count of that character in `s`, and `max_color_count` is the maximum value in `color_count`. If `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed to the console because `max_color_count` is greater than `k`.**
