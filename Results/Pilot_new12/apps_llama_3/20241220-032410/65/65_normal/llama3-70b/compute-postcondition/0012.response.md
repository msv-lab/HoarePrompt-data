Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in the string `s`. If `c` is in `color_count`, then the value of `c` in `color_count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `color_count` has `c` as a key with a value of 1.**
