The function accepts parameters n and k as positive integers and a string s of lowercase letters representing balloon colors, and returns a message to the console indicating whether the maximum number of balloons of the same color (max_color_count) can be distributed among k friends, printing 'YES' if max_color_count is less than or equal to k, and 'NO' otherwise, effectively determining the feasibility of distributing the balloons of the same color among the given number of friends.
