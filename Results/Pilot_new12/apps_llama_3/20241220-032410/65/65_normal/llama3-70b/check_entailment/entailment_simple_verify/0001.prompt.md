You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if max_color_count <= k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct according to the given problem description. It accurately determines whether Kefa can distribute all the balloons among his friends without any friend receiving two balloons of the same color.

Here's how it works:

- It first reads the number of balloons (`n`) and the number of friends (`k`) from the input.
- Then, it reads the string `s` representing the colors of the balloons.
- It uses a dictionary `color_count` to count the occurrences of each color.
- The maximum count of any color is then compared with the number of friends (`k`).
- If the maximum count of any color does not exceed the number of friends, it means each balloon of a specific color can be given to a different friend without any friend getting two balloons of the same color, so it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The program handles all the potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where the number of balloons or friends is 1. It also works correctly for the provided examples.

For instance, in the first example where `n = 4`, `k = 2`, and `s = 'aabb'`, the program correctly prints 'YES' because each color ('a' and 'b') appears twice, which does not exceed the number of friends (2), allowing for a distribution where each friend gets two balloons of different colors.

In the second example, where `n = 6`, `k = 3`, and `s = 'aacaab'`, the program correctly prints 'NO' because the color 'a' appears three times, which exceeds the number of friends (3), making it impossible to distribute the balloons without a friend getting two 'a' balloons.

Since the program correctly handles these and other potential cases, it is considered correct according to the given problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of balloons, k is a positive integer representing the number of friends, and s is a string of lowercase letters where each letter represents the color of a balloon, such that 1 <= n, k <= 100.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the original input string, `c` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, and `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is the count of that character in `s`. If `s` is empty, `color_count` is empty.
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if (max_color_count <= k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is the original input string, `c` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and each value is the count of that character in `s`, and `max_color_count` is the maximum value in `color_count`. If `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed to the console because `max_color_count` is greater than `k`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
