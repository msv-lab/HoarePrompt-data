#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle is a list of two strings, each string representing a row in the 2x2 puzzle grid, containing characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]
    #The program returns a string that is a combination of two strings, each string containing characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', representing the characters in the 2x2 puzzle grid.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2x2 puzzle grid as a list of two strings, each containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', and returns a combined string representing the puzzle grid. The returned string is a concatenation of the two input strings, effectively flattening the 2x2 grid into a single sequence of characters. The function does not modify the input puzzle grid and does not perform any error checking or handling for invalid input. The final state of the program after execution is that the original puzzle grid remains unchanged, and a new string representing the combined puzzle grid is returned. The function assumes that the input puzzle grid is a list of exactly two strings, each with a length of 2, and that the strings only contain the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If the input deviates from these assumptions, the function's behavior may not be as expected.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 grid puzzle.

    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        
        empty_row, empty_col = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos] = new_state[new_pos
                    ], new_state[empty_pos]
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is the original string, `queue` is empty, `visited` contains all unique reachable states from the original `start`, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, and `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col` correspond to the last explored state.
    return visited
    #The program returns `visited` which contains all unique reachable states from the original string `start`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `start` of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 grid puzzle. It returns a set `visited` containing all unique reachable states from the original string `start`, which are obtained by performing a breadth-first search (BFS) in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the initial state, where 'X' represents an empty space that can be moved to an adjacent position. The function handles all possible configurations of the 2 × 2 grid puzzle, excluding cases where the input string does not meet the specified criteria. The final state of the program includes the original string `start`, an empty queue, and a set `visited` containing all unique reachable states from the original string `start`. The function does not perform any error checking on the input string, so it assumes that the input will always be a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If the input string does not meet these criteria, the function's behavior may be undefined.
