The function accepts a 2x2 puzzle grid as a list of two strings, each containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', and returns a combined string representing the puzzle grid. The returned string is a concatenation of the two input strings, effectively flattening the 2x2 grid into a single sequence of characters. The function does not modify the input puzzle grid and does not perform any error checking or handling for invalid input. The final state of the program after execution is that the original puzzle grid remains unchanged, and a new string representing the combined puzzle grid is returned. The function assumes that the input puzzle grid is a list of exactly two strings, each with a length of 2, and that the strings only contain the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If the input deviates from these assumptions, the function's behavior may not be as expected.
