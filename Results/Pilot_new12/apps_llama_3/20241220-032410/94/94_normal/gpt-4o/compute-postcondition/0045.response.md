To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The code provided is:
```python
new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
```
Given the initial state:
- `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
- `queue` is not empty and its length is decreased by 1.
- `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start`.
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction.
- `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2.
- `dr` is -1 and `dc` is 0.

Let's calculate `new_row` and `new_col` based on the given values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`.

Given that `dr` is -1 and `dc` is 0, we can substitute these values into the equations:
```python
new_row = empty_row + (-1)
new_col = empty_col + 0
```
This simplifies to:
```python
new_row = empty_row - 1
new_col = empty_col
```
Since `empty_row` is the quotient of `empty_pos` divided by 2 and `empty_col` is the remainder of `empty_pos` divided by 2, and considering that `empty_pos` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3 (since `start` has a length of 4), we can calculate the possible values of `empty_row` and `empty_col`:

- If `empty_pos` is 0, then `empty_row` is 0 and `empty_col` is 0.
- If `empty_pos` is 1, then `empty_row` is 0 and `empty_col` is 1.
- If `empty_pos` is 2, then `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 0.
- If `empty_pos` is 3, then `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 1.

Substituting these values into our equations for `new_row` and `new_col`:

- If `empty_pos` is 0, `new_row` = -1 and `new_col` = 0.
- If `empty_pos` is 1, `new_row` = -1 and `new_col` = 1.
- If `empty_pos` is 2, `new_row` = 0 and `new_col` = 0.
- If `empty_pos` is 3, `new_row` = 0 and `new_col` = 1.

Considering the above, the states of `start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc` are not directly affected by the calculation of `new_row` and `new_col`. The only changes are in the values of `new_row` and `new_col`, which are calculated based on the values of `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is decreased by 1; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; if `empty_pos` is 0, `empty_row` is 0 and `empty_col` is 0, if `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0 and `empty_col` is 1, if `empty_pos` is 2, `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 0, if `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row` - 1; `new_col` is `empty_col`.**
