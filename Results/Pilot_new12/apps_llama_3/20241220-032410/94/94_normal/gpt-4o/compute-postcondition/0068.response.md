To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
```

Given the initial state:
- `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X';
- `queue` is not empty and its length could be increased by 1 from its original state or remains the same;
- `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited;
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction;
- `current` could be updated based on `queue`;
- `empty_row` and `empty_col` could be updated based on `empty_pos` and a new 'X' position;
- `dr` is -1;
- `dc` is 0;
- `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`;
- `new_col` is `empty_col`.

The code calculates `new_pos` based on `new_row` and `new_col`. Since `new_row` is `empty_row - 1` and `new_col` is `empty_col`, we can express `new_pos` as:
```python
new_pos = (empty_row - 1) * 2 + empty_col
```

The states of `start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `dr`, and `dc` are not directly affected by this calculation. Therefore, their values remain as described in the initial state.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length could be increased by 1 from its original state or remains the same; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` could be updated based on `queue`; `empty_row` and `empty_col` could be updated based on `empty_pos` and a new 'X' position; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`; `new_col` is `empty_col`; `new_pos` is `(empty_row - 1) * 2 + empty_col`**
