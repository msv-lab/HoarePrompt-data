According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `directions` list. If there are more directions to iterate over, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `dr` is -1 and `dc` is 0, which corresponds to the first direction in the list. For the loop to execute again, it should move to the next direction in the list.

The `directions` list is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]. Since the last iteration used the first direction (-1, 0), the next iteration will use the second direction (1, 0). 

So, the states that need to be adjusted are `dr` and `dc`, which should be updated to the next direction in the list.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque which contains `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains an empty deque; `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains a set containing only `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `dr` is 1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row + 1`; `new_col` is `empty_col`; if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_pos` is (`empty_pos // 2` + 1) * 2 + `empty_pos % 2`, `new_state` is a list of characters where the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped, and `new_state_str` is a string where the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` of `current` have been swapped.**
