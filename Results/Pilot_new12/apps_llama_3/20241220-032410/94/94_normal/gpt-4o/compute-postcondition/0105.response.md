To determine the output state, we need to calculate the value of `new_pos` based on the given initial state.

Given:
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`
- `new_row` is `empty_row`
- `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`

The formula to calculate `new_pos` is:
`new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col`

Since `new_row` equals `empty_row` and `new_col` equals `empty_col - 1`, we substitute these into the formula:
`new_pos = empty_row * 2 + (empty_col - 1)`

Given that `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`, and `current` is derived from `start` which is a string of length 4, we can deduce the possible positions of 'X'. However, without knowing the exact position of 'X' in `start`, we cannot directly calculate `empty_row` and `empty_col`. 

But, considering the structure of the problem, `empty_pos` can be 0, 1, 2, or 3, which means `empty_row` can be 0 (if `empty_pos` is 0 or 1) or 1 (if `empty_pos` is 2 or 3), and `empty_col` can be 0 (if `empty_pos` is 0 or 2) or 1 (if `empty_pos` is 1 or 3).

Let's analyze the possible scenarios for `new_col` given `new_col = empty_col - 1`:
- If `empty_col` is 0, then `new_col` would be -1.
- If `empty_col` is 1, then `new_col` would be 0.

Now, considering `new_pos = empty_row * 2 + new_col`, if `new_col` is -1, then `new_pos` would be `empty_row * 2 - 1`. If `new_col` is 0, then `new_pos` would simply be `empty_row * 2`.

Given the initial conditions and the calculation, `new_pos` can take on values based on the position of 'X' and the direction being explored. Since `empty_col` can be either 0 or 1, and we're exploring the direction `(0, -1)` which implies moving left, `new_col` will either be -1 (if moving from the first column to a hypothetical column before it, which in a 2x2 grid is not possible but in terms of calculation gives -1) or 0 (if moving from the second column to the first).

However, the specific value of `new_pos` depends on `empty_row` and `empty_col`, which are determined by the position of 'X'. Without the exact position of 'X', we can say `new_pos` equals either `empty_row * 2 - 1` (if moving from the right column) or `empty_row * 2` (if somehow `new_col` ends up being 0, which would be the case if 'X' is in the rightmost position and we're considering a move that doesn't change the column, but this seems to be a theoretical consideration given the direction `(0, -1)` implies a leftward move).

Thus, considering the constraints and focusing on the change due to the code:
- `start` remains a string of length 4.
- `queue` is not empty.
- `visited` contains all unique states that have been visited.
- `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.
- `current` is the last state explored.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`.
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`.
- The current direction being explored is `(0, -1)`.
- `new_row` is `empty_row`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`.
- `new_pos` is calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`, which, given `new_col` is typically -1 when moving left, results in `new_pos = empty_row * 2 - 1` for the leftward move from the right column.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, `queue` is not empty, `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the last state explored, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, the current direction being explored is `(0, -1)`, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, and `new_pos` is `empty_row * 2 - 1` when moving left from the right column.**
