The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the value of `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. The value of `new_state_str` is a string representing `new_state` where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have been swapped.

Since `new_state_str` is not in the `visited` set initially, the updated `visited` set will contain all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and `new_state_str`.

All other variables are not affected by the code, so their values remain the same.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is decreased by 1; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and `new_state_str`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; if `empty_pos` is 2, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 0, if `empty_pos` is 3, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row` - 1; `new_col` is `empty_col`; `new_pos` is either 0 or 1; `new_state_str` is a string representing `new_state` where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have been swapped**.
