The value of `new_state_str` is calculated by joining all the elements in `new_state` into a string. The `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have been swapped. The `empty_pos` can be either 2 or 3. 

The `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. The `queue` is not empty and its length is decreased by 1. The `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start`. The `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction. The `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`. 

If `empty_pos` is 2, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 0, if `empty_pos` is 3, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 1. The `dr` is -1; The `dc` is 0; The `new_row` is `empty_row` - 1; The `new_col` is `empty_col`; The `new_pos` is either 0 or 1.

The `new_state_str` is assigned the value of `new_state` converted into a string. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is decreased by 1; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; if `empty_pos` is 2, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 0, if `empty_pos` is 3, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row` - 1; `new_col` is `empty_col`; `new_pos` is either 0 or 1; `new_state_str` is a string representing `new_state` where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have been swapped.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is decreased by 1; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; if `empty_pos` is 2, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 0, if `empty_pos` is 3, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row` - 1; `new_col` is `empty_col`; `new_pos` is either 0 or 1; `new_state_str` is a string representing `new_state` where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have been swapped**
