The given code snippet is used to calculate the new position of the 'X' (empty position) in the string `current` after moving in a certain direction. 

Given the current direction being explored is `(1, 0)`, this implies that `dr = 1` and `dc = 0`. 

`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`. 

Therefore, `new_row` becomes `empty_row + 1` and `new_col` remains the same as `empty_col`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` is the last state explored; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + 1` and `new_col` is `empty_col`; the current direction being explored is `(1, 0)`**
