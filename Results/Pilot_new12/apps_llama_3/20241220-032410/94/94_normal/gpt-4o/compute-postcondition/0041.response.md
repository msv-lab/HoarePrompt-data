The value of `current` is updated to be the leftmost element of `queue`, which is then removed from `queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected, except that the length of `queue` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is decreased by 1; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`**
