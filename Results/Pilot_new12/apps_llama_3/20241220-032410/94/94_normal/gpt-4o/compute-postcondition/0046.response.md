Postcondition: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is decreased by 1; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; if `empty_pos` is 0, the current value of `empty_row` is 0 and the current value of `empty_col` is 0, if `empty_pos` is 1, the current value of `empty_row` is 0 and the current value of `empty_col` is 1, if `empty_pos` is 2, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 0, if `empty_pos` is 3, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row` - 1; `new_col` is `empty_col`; the current row `new_row` and column `new_col` are within the boundaries, such that 0 is less than or equal to `new_row` and `new_row` is less than 2, and 0 is less than or equal to `new_col` and `new_col` is less than 2**
