According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `directions` list. If there are more directions to explore, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, and the loop has presumably explored one direction. 

For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to move on to the next direction in the list. Assuming the loop iterates over the `directions` list in order, if the last iteration explored the first direction `(-1, 0)`, the next iteration should explore the second direction `(1, 0)`. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are the ones related to the current direction being explored, which is now the second direction `(1, 0)`.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` is the last state explored; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; the current direction being explored is `(1, 0)`**
