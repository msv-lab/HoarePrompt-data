Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` is the last state explored; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + 1` and `new_col` is `empty_col`; the current direction being explored is `(1, 0)`; `new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) + 1) * 2 + empty_pos % 2`; `new_state_str` is the string representation of the list `new_state` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the original value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the original value at `new_state[empty_pos]`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` contains `new_state_str` as its last element and `visited` includes the new state `new_state_str`.***
