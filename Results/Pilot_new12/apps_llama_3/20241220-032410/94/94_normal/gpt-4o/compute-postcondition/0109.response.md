The value of `new_state_str` is added to the `visited` set. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `new_state_str` is equal to `''.join(new_state)` where `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[empty_pos]`. 
The values of the other variables remain the same: `start` is still a string of length 4, `queue` is not empty, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the last state explored, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 4`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 4`, the current direction being explored is `(0, -1)`, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 4 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[empty_pos]`, and `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`.
Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, `queue` is not empty, `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited including `new_state_str`, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the last state explored, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 4`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 4`, the current direction being explored is `(0, -1)`, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 4 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[empty_pos]`, and `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`**.
