The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`. 

The `queue` was a deque which contains `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains an empty deque. Now, with this code, `new_state_str` will be added to the `queue` regardless of the previous conditions because the code does not check these conditions.

`new_state_str` is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX'. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; 
`queue` is a deque which contains `new_state_str` (which is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX'); 
`visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str` (which is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX'); 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; 
`current` is equal to `start`; 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; 
`dr` is 1; 
`dc` is 0; 
`new_state` is either ['C', 'B', 'X', 'A'] or ['A', 'C', 'B', 'X']; 
`new_state_str` is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX'.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque which contains `new_state_str` (which is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX'); `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str` (which is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX'); `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `dr` is 1; `dc` is 0; `new_state` is either ['C', 'B', 'X', 'A'] or ['A', 'C', 'B', 'X']; `new_state_str` is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX'.**
