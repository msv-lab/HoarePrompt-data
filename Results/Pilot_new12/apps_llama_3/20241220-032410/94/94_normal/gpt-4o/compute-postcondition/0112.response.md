Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` is the last state explored; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 4` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 4`; the current direction being explored is `(0, -1)`; `new_row` is `empty_row` and `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then a new state is created by swapping the character at `empty_pos` with the character at `new_pos`, and if this new state has not been visited before, it is added to `queue` and `visited`.***
