The code creates a new set called `visited` and assigns it a set containing the `start` string. 

The value of `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. The `queue` is a deque containing `start`. 

The value of `visited` is now a set containing the string `start`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`.
Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`**
