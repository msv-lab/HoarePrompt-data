The value of `current` is updated to be the leftmost element of the `queue`. The `queue` is also updated as its leftmost element has been removed. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and has been updated by removing its leftmost element; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and all reachable states from `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the last state explored, which is the state that was previously at the front of `queue`; `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` correspond to the last explored state**
