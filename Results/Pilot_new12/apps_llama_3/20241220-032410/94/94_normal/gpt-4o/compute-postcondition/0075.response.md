Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length could be increased by 1 from its original state or remains the same; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` could be updated based on `queue`; `empty_row` and `empty_col` could be updated based on `empty_pos` and a new 'X' position; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`; `new_col` is `empty_col`. If `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains `new_state_str` as its last element if `new_state_str` is not already in `visited`. Otherwise, the state of `visited` and `queue` remains unchanged.***
