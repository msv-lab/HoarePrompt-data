To determine the output state, let's analyze the given initial state and the Python code snippet.

Initial State: 
```python
visited.add(new_state_str)
```
In this case, we don't have an explicit initial state description except for the line of code itself, which implies that `visited` is a set and `new_state_str` is a string being added to it.

The code snippet adds `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. This implies that `visited` is a set that keeps track of visited states, and `new_state_str` represents a new state being visited.

Output State: **`visited` is a set containing `new_state_str` among its elements, `new_state_str` is a string that has been added to `visited`.**
