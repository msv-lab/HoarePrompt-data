Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is either decreased by 1 from its original state if `new_state_str` is in `visited`, or remains the same from its original state if moving the 'X' up would result in an index out of bounds or `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and the new position is within bounds; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and potentially `new_state_str` if it was not already in `visited` and `new_state_str` corresponds to a valid move; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined based on `empty_pos` as before; `dr` is 1; `dc` is 0; if `0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_row` is `empty_row + 1`; `new_col` is `empty_col`; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + 1) * 2 + empty_col`; `new_state` is a list of 4 characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped; `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)` and `queue` length is increased by 1 if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`; otherwise, `queue` length remains the same.***
