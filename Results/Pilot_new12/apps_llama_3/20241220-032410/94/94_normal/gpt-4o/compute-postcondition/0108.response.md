The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` joins the characters in the `new_state` list into a string. The `new_state` list is a modified version of the `current` state where the characters at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped.

The `new_state` list was created by swapping the characters at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in the `current` state. The `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, the `new_row` is `empty_row`, the `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, and the `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`.

The values of `start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, the current direction being explored, `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are not affected by this code.

The value of `new_state_str` is the string representation of the `new_state` list.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, `queue` is not empty, `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the last state explored, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 4`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 4`, the current direction being explored is `(0, -1)`, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 4 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[empty_pos]`, and `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`**
