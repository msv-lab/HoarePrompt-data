To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement: `while queue`. This loop will continue to execute as long as `queue` is not empty.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
- `queue` contains all reachable unvisited states from `start`.
- `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and all reachable states from `start`.
- `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)].
- `current` is the last state explored.
- `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` correspond to the last explored state.

For the loop to execute one more time, the `queue` must not be empty. This means that there must be at least one more unvisited state reachable from `start` that has not been added to the `visited` set yet.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` must not be empty; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and all reachable states from `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the last state explored; `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` correspond to the last explored state**
