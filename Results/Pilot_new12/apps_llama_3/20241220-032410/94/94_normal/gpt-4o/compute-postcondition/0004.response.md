The value of `current` is assigned the value of the leftmost element of `queue`, which is `start` since `start` was the only element added to `queue` initially. After the operation, `queue` is left with no elements since it only had one element initially. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is an empty deque; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`**
