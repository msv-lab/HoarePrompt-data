To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we analyze the provided initial state and the impact of the code on it.

The initial state includes:
- `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
- `queue` is an empty deque.
- `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str`.
- `directions` is a list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)].
- `current` is equal to `start`.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`.
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`.
- `dr` is -1.
- `dc` is 0.
- `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col`.
- `new_pos` is (`empty_pos // 2` - 1) * 2 + `empty_pos % 2`.
- `new_state` is a list of characters where the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped.
- `new_state_str` is a string where the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` of `current` have been swapped.

The code to be executed is `queue.append(new_state_str)`. This operation adds `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`.

Given the initial state, after executing `queue.append(new_state_str)`, the changes are as follows:
- The `queue`, which was initially empty, now contains `new_state_str`.

The rest of the variables (`start`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, `dc`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `new_state`, and `new_state_str`) retain their initial values or expressions they are equal to, as the code does not modify them.

Therefore, the output state after executing the given Python code is:
- `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
- `queue` contains `new_state_str`.
- `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str`.
- `directions` is a list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)].
- `current` is equal to `start`.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`.
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`.
- `dr` is -1.
- `dc` is 0.
- `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`.
- `new_col` is `empty_col`.
- `new_pos` is (`empty_pos // 2` - 1) * 2 + `empty_pos % 2`.
- `new_state` is a list of characters where the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped.
- `new_state_str` is a string where the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` of `current` have been swapped.
