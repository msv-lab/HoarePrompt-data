Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque which contains `new_state_str` (which is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX') if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains an empty deque; `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str` (which is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX') if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains a set containing only `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `dr` is 1; `dc` is 0; if `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, then `new_state` is either ['C', 'B', 'X', 'A'] or ['A', 'C', 'B', 'X'] and `new_state_str` is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX'; if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` contains `new_state_str` and `visited` contains `new_state_str`, otherwise `queue` remains empty and `visited` remains unchanged.***
