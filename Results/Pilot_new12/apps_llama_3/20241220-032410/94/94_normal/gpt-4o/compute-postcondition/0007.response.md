According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `directions` list. If the list has at least 1 direction, the loop can execute. Since `directions` is a list of 4 tuples representing possible movements, the loop will execute. The loop iterates over each direction in `directions`, so `dr` and `dc` will take on the values of each direction tuple in the list. 

At the start of the loop, `dr` and `dc` should be the first direction in the list, which is `(-1, 0)`. 

State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is an empty deque; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, which is an integer between 0 and 3, inclusive; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `dr` is -1 and `dc` is 0**
