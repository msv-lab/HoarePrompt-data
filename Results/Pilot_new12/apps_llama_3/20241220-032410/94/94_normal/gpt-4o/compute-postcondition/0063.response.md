The given code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. 

The `queue` was not empty and its length is either decreased by 1 from its original state if `new_state_str` is in `visited`, or remains the same from its original state if moving the 'X' up would result in an index out of bounds. Now, a new state string is added to it.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`start` is still a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. 

`visited` is still a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and `new_state_str`.

`directions` is still [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction.

`current` is still the leftmost element that was in `queue`.

`empty_row` and `empty_col` are still determined based on `empty_pos` as before.

`dr` is still 1.

`dc` is still 0.

`new_row` is still `empty_row + 1`.

`new_col` is still `empty_col`.

`new_pos` is still `(empty_row + 1) * 2 + empty_col`.

`new_state` is still a list of 4 characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped.

`new_state_str` is still `''.join(new_state)`.

The length of the `queue` has increased by 1 as a new state string is appended to it.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty, its length has increased by 1, and contains all the unique states that have been visited so far including `new_state_str`; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and `new_state_str`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined based on `empty_pos` as before; `dr` is 1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row + 1`; `new_col` is `empty_col`; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + 1) * 2 + empty_col`; `new_state` is a list of 4 characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped; `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`.**
