Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is either decreased by 1 from its original state if `new_state_str` is in `visited`, or remains the same from its original state if moving the 'X' up would result in an index out of bounds; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and potentially `new_state_str` if it was not already in `visited` and `new_state_str` corresponds to a valid move; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined based on `empty_pos` as before; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; if a move up is valid (i.e., `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`), `new_row` is `empty_row` - 1, `new_col` is `empty_col`, and `new_state_str` is potentially added to `queue` based on whether it was in `visited` or not, otherwise no change occurs***
