The code `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)` converts the list `new_state` into a string `new_state_str`. 

The value of `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have been swapped. 

`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, and `new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`. 

`new_row` equals `empty_row`, and `new_col` equals `empty_col - 1`. 

`empty_row` and `empty_col` are calculated based on `empty_pos`. 

`dr` is 0, and `dc` is -1.

Since the code only assigns a new value to `new_state_str`, the states of the other variables are not affected.

The value of `new_state_str` is a string representation of the list `new_state`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; 
`queue` is a deque which may contain `new_state_str` under certain conditions; 
`visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly `new_state_str`; 
`directions` remains `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; 
`current` equals `start`; 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; 
`empty_row` and `empty_col` are calculated based on `empty_pos`; 
`dr` is 0; 
`dc` is -1; 
`new_row` equals `empty_row`; 
`new_col` equals `empty_col - 1`; 
`new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`; 
`new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have been swapped; 
`new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)`.
