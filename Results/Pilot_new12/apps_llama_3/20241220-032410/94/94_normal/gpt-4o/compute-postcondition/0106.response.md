The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list `new_state` that is a copy of the `current` state. 

The value of `current` is a string of length 4 where one of the characters is 'X'. 

`new_state` becomes a list of characters in the string `current`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4, 
`queue` is not empty, 
`visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, 
`directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, 
`current` is the last state explored, 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, 
the current direction being explored is `(0, -1)`, 
`new_row` is `empty_row`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, 
`new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, 
`new_state` is a list of characters in the string `current`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, `queue` is not empty, `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the last state explored, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, the current direction being explored is `(0, -1)`, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, `new_state` is a list of characters in the string `current`**
