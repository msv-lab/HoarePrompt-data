To calculate the new state, we first need to understand the given initial state and how the variables are updated by the provided code.

Given that `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', and assuming `current` equals `start`, the index of 'X' in `current` (which is `empty_pos`) can vary depending on the arrangement of these characters in `start`. However, for simplicity, let's consider an example arrangement where `start` = 'ABCX'. In this case, `empty_pos` would be 3 (since Python uses zero-based indexing).

Given `empty_pos` = 3, and assuming a 2x2 grid arrangement for the characters in `start` (since the length of `start` is 4), we can calculate `empty_row` and `empty_col` as follows:
- `empty_row` = `empty_pos` // 2 = 3 // 2 = 1
- `empty_col` = `empty_pos` % 2 = 3 % 2 = 1

Now, with `dr` = 0 and `dc` = -1, we update `new_row` and `new_col` based on the given code:
- `new_row` = `empty_row` + `dr` = 1 + 0 = 1
- `new_col` = `empty_col` + `dc` = 1 + (-1) = 0

The code does not directly update `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, or any other variable besides calculating `new_row` and `new_col`. Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions plus the updated values for `new_row` and `new_col`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque which may contain `new_state_str` under certain conditions; `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly `new_state_str`; `directions` remains `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` equals `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` and `empty_col` are calculated based on `empty_pos`; `dr` is 0; `dc` is -1; `new_row` equals `empty_row`; `new_col` equals `empty_col - 1`**
