To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The given code is:
```python
new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
```

From the initial state:
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- The value of `empty_row` and `empty_col` depends on `empty_pos`.
- `new_row` is `empty_row` - 1.
- `new_col` is `empty_col`.
- The current row `new_row` and column `new_col` are within the boundaries, such that 0 is less than or equal to `new_row` and `new_row` is less than 2, and 0 is less than or equal to `new_col` and `new_col` is less than 2.

Given that `new_row` = `empty_row` - 1, we can analyze the possible values of `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, and `new_col`:

1. If `empty_pos` is 0, then `empty_row` is 0 and `empty_col` is 0. This results in `new_row` = -1 and `new_col` = 0. However, `new_row` = -1 is not within the given boundaries, so this scenario is not possible.

2. If `empty_pos` is 1, then `empty_row` is 0 and `empty_col` is 1. This results in `new_row` = -1 and `new_col` = 1. However, `new_row` = -1 is not within the given boundaries, so this scenario is not possible.

3. If `empty_pos` is 2, then `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 0. This results in `new_row` = 0 and `new_col` = 0.

4. If `empty_pos` is 3, then `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 1. This results in `new_row` = 0 and `new_col` = 1.

Now, let's calculate `new_pos` for the possible scenarios:

- For `empty_pos` = 2, `new_row` = 0, `new_col` = 0, `new_pos` = 0 * 2 + 0 = 0.
- For `empty_pos` = 3, `new_row` = 0, `new_col` = 1, `new_pos` = 0 * 2 + 1 = 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is decreased by 1; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; if `empty_pos` is 2, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 0, if `empty_pos` is 3, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row` - 1; `new_col` is `empty_col`; `new_pos` is either 0 or 1.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is decreased by 1; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; if `empty_pos` is 2, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 0, if `empty_pos` is 3, the current value of `empty_row` is 1 and the current value of `empty_col` is 1; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row` - 1; `new_col` is `empty_col`; `new_pos` is either 0 or 1.**
