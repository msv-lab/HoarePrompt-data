To calculate the new state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
- `queue` is an empty deque.
- `visited` is a set containing `start`.
- `directions` is a list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)].
- `current` is equal to `start`.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, which is an integer between 0 and 3, inclusive.
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`.
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`.
- `dr` is -1 and `dc` is 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
```
Given `dr` is -1 and `dc` is 0, we can substitute these values into the equation:
```python
new_row, new_col = empty_row - 1, empty_col
```
Since `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_pos` is between 0 and 3, `empty_row` can be either 0 or 1. 

Let's consider the possible values of `empty_pos` and their impact on `empty_row` and `empty_col`:
- If `empty_pos` is 0, then `empty_row` is 0 and `empty_col` is 0.
- If `empty_pos` is 1, then `empty_row` is 0 and `empty_col` is 1.
- If `empty_pos` is 2, then `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 0.
- If `empty_pos` is 3, then `empty_row` is 1 and `empty_col` is 1.

Given `new_row = empty_row - 1`, we have:
- If `empty_row` is 0, then `new_row` is -1.
- If `empty_row` is 1, then `new_row` is 0.

Thus, `new_row` will be either -1 or 0, depending on the initial value of `empty_row`. `new_col` remains the same as `empty_col`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:
- `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
- `queue` is an empty deque.
- `visited` is a set containing `start`.
- `directions` is a list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)].
- `current` is equal to `start`.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, which is an integer between 0 and 3, inclusive.
- `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`.
- `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`.
- `dr` is -1 and `dc` is 0.
- `new_row` is either -1 (if `empty_row` is 0) or 0 (if `empty_row` is 1).
- `new_col` is the same as `empty_col`, which is either 0 (if `empty_pos` is 0 or 2) or 1 (if `empty_pos` is 1 or 3).

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is an empty deque; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, which is an integer between 0 and 3, inclusive; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`; `new_col` is `empty_col`.**
