According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `queue` is a deque containing `start`. Since `queue` is not empty, no adjustments are needed to ensure the loop can execute at least one time.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
