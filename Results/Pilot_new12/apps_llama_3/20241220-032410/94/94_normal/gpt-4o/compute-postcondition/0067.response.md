To determine the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables.

1. `new_row` and `new_col` are calculated based on `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `dr`, and `dc`.
2. `dr` is given as -1, and `dc` is given as 0.
3. The initial values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are not specified, but they can be updated based on `empty_pos` and a new 'X' position.

Given the provided code:
```python
new_row, new_col = empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc
```
And given that `dr = -1` and `dc = 0`, the calculations for `new_row` and `new_col` become:
```python
new_row = empty_row - 1
new_col = empty_col
```
This means `new_row` is decremented by 1 from `empty_row`, and `new_col` remains the same as `empty_col`.

Other variables (`start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`) are not directly affected by this specific line of code, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length could be increased by 1 from its original state or remains the same; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` could be updated based on `queue`; `empty_row` and `empty_col` could be updated based on `empty_pos` and a new 'X' position; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`; `new_col` is `empty_col`**
