The provided Python code snippet is `queue.append(new_state_str)`. This code appends the string `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue` list. 

Given the initial state, we know that `new_state_str` is the string representation of the list `new_state` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the original value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the original value at `new_state[empty_pos]`. 

Since `queue` is not empty and `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including the new state `new_state_str`, the only variable affected by this code snippet is `queue`. 

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

`start` is still a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; 
`visited` is still a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including the new state `new_state_str`; 
`directions` is still `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; 
`current` is still the last state explored; 
`empty_pos` is still the index of 'X' in the string `current`; 
`empty_row` is still `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is still `empty_pos % 2`; 
`new_row` is still `empty_row + 1` and `new_col` is still `empty_col`; 
the current direction being explored is still `(1, 0)`; 
`new_pos` is still `((empty_pos // 2) + 1) * 2 + empty_pos % 2`; 
`new_state_str` is still the string representation of the list `new_state` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the original value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the original value at `new_state[empty_pos]`.

However, `queue` now contains an additional element, which is `new_state_str`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and contains `new_state_str` as its last element; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including the new state `new_state_str`; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` is the last state explored; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + 1` and `new_col` is `empty_col`; the current direction being explored is `(1, 0)`; `new_pos` is `((empty_pos // 2) + 1) * 2 + empty_pos % 2`; `new_state_str` is the string representation of the list `new_state` where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the original value at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the original value at `new_state[empty_pos]`.**
