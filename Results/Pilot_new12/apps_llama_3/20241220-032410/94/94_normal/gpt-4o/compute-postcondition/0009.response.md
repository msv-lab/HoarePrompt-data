Postcondition: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is an empty deque; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, which is an integer between 0 and 3, inclusive; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; the current value of `dr` is -1; the current value of `dc` is 0; the current value of `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`; the current value of `new_col` is `empty_col`; and `new_row` and `new_col` satisfy the condition 0 <= `new_row` < 2 and 0 <= `new_col` < 2.**
