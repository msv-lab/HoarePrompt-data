The given code defines a list of directions as `directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`. This code does not modify the existing variables `start`, `queue`, or `visited`. It introduces a new variable `directions` that represents possible movements in a grid.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing `start`; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
