The given code updates the values of `new_row` and `new_col`. The values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` are used to calculate the new values of `new_row` and `new_col`. The `dr` and `dc` are used as the change in row and column respectively.

`dr` is given as 1 and `dc` is given as 0, and `empty_row` and `empty_col` are calculated as `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_pos % 2` respectively.

Since `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, and `current` is equal to `start`, we know that `start` is a string of length 4. 

Let's consider all possible positions of 'X' in `start`. 

If 'X' is at the first position, `empty_pos` is 0, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 0, `new_row` is 0 + 1 = 1, `new_col` is 0 + 0 = 0.

If 'X' is at the second position, `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 0 + 1 = 1, `new_col` is 1 + 0 = 1.

If 'X' is at the third position, `empty_pos` is 2, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 0, `new_row` is 1 + 1 = 2, `new_col` is 0 + 0 = 0.

If 'X' is at the fourth position, `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 1 + 1 = 2, `new_col` is 1 + 0 = 1.

However, given the initial constraints that `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, only the first two cases where 'X' is at the first or second position are valid.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; 
`queue` is a deque which contains `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains an empty deque; 
`visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains a set containing only `start`; 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; 
`current` is equal to `start`; 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; 
`dr` is 1; 
`dc` is 0; 
`new_row` is either 1 if 'X' is at the first or second position in `start`, or undefined if 'X' is at the third or fourth position in `start`; 
`new_col` is either 0 if 'X' is at the first position in `start`, or 1 if 'X' is at the second position in `start`, or undefined if 'X' is at the third or fourth position in `start`.
