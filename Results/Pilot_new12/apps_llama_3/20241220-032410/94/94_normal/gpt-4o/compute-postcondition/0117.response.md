Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `start` of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 grid puzzle. It returns a set `visited` containing all unique reachable states from the original string `start`, which are obtained by performing a breadth-first search (BFS) in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the initial state, where 'X' represents an empty space that can be moved to an adjacent position. The function handles all possible configurations of the 2 × 2 grid puzzle, excluding cases where the input string does not meet the specified criteria. The final state of the program includes the original string `start`, an empty queue, and a set `visited` containing all unique reachable states from the original string `start`. The function does not perform any error checking on the input string, so it assumes that the input will always be a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If the input string does not meet these criteria, the function's behavior may be undefined.**
