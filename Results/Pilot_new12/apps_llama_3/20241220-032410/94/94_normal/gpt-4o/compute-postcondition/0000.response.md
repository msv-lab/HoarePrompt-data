The code initializes a queue data structure with the initial state `start` as its first element. 

`queue` is assigned the value of a deque containing `start`, where `start` is a string of length 4 consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing the initial configuration `start`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque containing `start`**
