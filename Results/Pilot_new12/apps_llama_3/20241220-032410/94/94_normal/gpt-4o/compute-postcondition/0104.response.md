The given code is calculating the new position of the empty space 'X' based on the current direction being explored. The current direction is `(0, -1)`, which means we are moving left. 

The variables `dr` and `dc` represent the change in row and column respectively. Since the current direction is `(0, -1)`, `dr` is 0 and `dc` is -1.

So, `new_row` is `empty_row + 0` which is equal to `empty_row`, and `new_col` is `empty_col + (-1)` which is equal to `empty_col - 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` is the last state explored; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; the current direction being explored is `(0, -1)`; `new_row` is `empty_row` and `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` is the last state explored; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; the current direction being explored is `(0, -1)`; `new_row` is `empty_row` and `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`**
