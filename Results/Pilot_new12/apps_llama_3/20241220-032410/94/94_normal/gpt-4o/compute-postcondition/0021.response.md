To determine the output state, we need to consider the possible values of `new_row` and `new_col` based on the position of 'X' in `start`.

- If 'X' is at the first position in `start`, then `empty_pos` is 0, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 0, `new_row` is 1, and `new_col` is 0.
- If 'X' is at the second position in `start`, then `empty_pos` is 1, `empty_row` is 0, `empty_col` is 1, `new_row` is 1, and `new_col` is 1.
- If 'X' is at the third position in `start`, then `empty_pos` is 2, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 0, and `new_row` and `new_col` are undefined because they are calculated based on the conditions `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2` which are not met when 'X' is at the third or fourth position.
- If 'X' is at the fourth position in `start`, then `empty_pos` is 3, `empty_row` is 1, `empty_col` is 1, and `new_row` and `new_col` are undefined for the same reasons as above.

Given the formula `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col`, we calculate `new_pos` for the scenarios where `new_row` and `new_col` are defined:

- For 'X' at the first position: `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 0 = 2`.
- For 'X' at the second position: `new_pos = 1 * 2 + 1 = 3`.

When 'X' is at the third or fourth position, `new_pos` is undefined because `new_row` and `new_col` are undefined.

The states of the other variables are not affected by the calculation of `new_pos`. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `new_pos` based on the position of 'X' in `start`, along with the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque which contains `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains an empty deque; `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains a set containing only `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `dr` is 1; `dc` is 0; if 'X' is at the first position in `start`, then `new_row` is 1, `new_col` is 0, and `new_pos` is 2; if 'X' is at the second position in `start`, then `new_row` is 1, `new_col` is 1, and `new_pos` is 3; if 'X' is at the third or fourth position in `start`, then `new_row`, `new_col`, and `new_pos` are undefined.**
