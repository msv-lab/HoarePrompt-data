The code `visited.add(new_state_str)` adds the current value of `new_state_str` to the `visited` set. 

The value of `new_state_str` is a string where the characters at positions `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including the current value of `new_state_str`; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` is the last state explored; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` and `new_col` are within the bounds of a 2x2 grid; `new_pos` is an integer between 0 and 3, calculated as `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is now equal to the original value of `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is now equal to the original value of `new_state[empty_pos]`; `new_state_str` is a string equal to `''.join(new_state)`.
