Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `directions` remains `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` equals `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` and `empty_col` are calculated based on `empty_pos`; `dr` is 0; `dc` is -1; `new_row` equals `empty_row`; `new_col` equals `empty_col - 1`; `new_pos` equals `new_row * 2 + new_col`; `new_state` is a list where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` have been swapped; `new_state_str` equals `''.join(new_state)`. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` is a deque containing `new_state_str` in addition to its previous contents and `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str`. If `new_state_str` is in `visited`, then the state of `queue` and `visited` remains unchanged.***
