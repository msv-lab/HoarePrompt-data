Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is either increased by 1 from its original state if `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, or remains the same from its original state if `new_state_str` is in `visited`; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and potentially `new_state_str` if it was not already in `visited`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)] and must have at least 1 direction; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; `empty_row` and `empty_col` are determined based on `empty_pos` as before; `dr` is 1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row + 1`; `new_col` is `empty_col`; `new_pos` is `(empty_row + 1) * 2 + empty_col`; `new_state` is a list of 4 characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` are swapped; `new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`***
