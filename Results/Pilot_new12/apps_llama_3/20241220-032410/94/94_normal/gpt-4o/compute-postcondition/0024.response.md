The given code line is: 
```python
new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
```
The impact of this code line is to convert the list `new_state` into a string and assign this string to `new_state_str`. 

From the initial state, we know `new_state` is either ['C', 'B', 'X', 'A'] or ['A', 'C', 'B', 'X']. So, `new_state_str` will become either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX'.

Other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; 
`queue` is a deque which contains `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains an empty deque; 
`visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains a set containing only `start`; 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; 
`current` is equal to `start`; 
`empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; 
`dr` is 1; 
`dc` is 0; 
`new_state` is either ['C', 'B', 'X', 'A'] or ['A', 'C', 'B', 'X']; 
`new_state_str` is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX'.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque which contains `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains an empty deque; `visited` is a set containing `start` and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` is not in `visited` and `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, otherwise it remains a set containing only `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `dr` is 1; `dc` is 0; `new_state` is either ['C', 'B', 'X', 'A'] or ['A', 'C', 'B', 'X']; `new_state_str` is either 'CBXA' or 'ACBX'**
