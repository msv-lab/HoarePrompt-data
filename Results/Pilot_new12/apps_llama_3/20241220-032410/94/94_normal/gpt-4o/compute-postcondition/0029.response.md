To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'.
- `queue` is a deque which may contain `new_state_str` under certain conditions.
- `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly `new_state_str`.
- `directions` is a list of tuples representing possible movements: `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`.
- `current` equals `start`.
- `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`.
- `empty_row` and `empty_col` are calculated based on `empty_pos`.
- `dr` is 1 and `dc` is 0, which suggests the current direction being considered.

The loop iterates over each direction in `directions`. At the end of the previous iteration, it has considered the direction `(1, 0)`, given that `dr` is 1 and `dc` is 0. For the loop to execute again, it needs to move on to the next direction in the list.

The next direction in `directions` after `(1, 0)` is `(0, -1)`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `dr` should be updated to 0 (since we're moving to a new direction).
- `dc` should be updated to -1 (reflecting the new direction `(0, -1)`).

Other states like `queue`, `visited`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and `new_state_str` would be updated based on the operations performed within the loop body, which is not provided. However, based on the loop statement alone, we can determine the change in `dr` and `dc`.

State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is a deque which may contain `new_state_str` under certain conditions; `visited` is a set containing `start` and possibly `new_state_str`; `directions` remains `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` equals `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` and `empty_col` are calculated based on `empty_pos`; `dr` is 0; `dc` is -1**
