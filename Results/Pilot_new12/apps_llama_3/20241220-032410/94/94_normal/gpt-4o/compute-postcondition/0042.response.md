The value of `empty_pos` is updated to be the index of 'X' in `current`. The states of the other variables are not affected, except that `empty_pos` might change, which could then affect the values of `empty_row` and `empty_col` in subsequent operations, but those operations are not shown here. So, we consider only the change in `empty_pos`. The `start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current` variables retain their original properties.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and its length is decreased by 1; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the leftmost element that was in `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`**
