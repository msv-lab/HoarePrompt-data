The code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The `visited` set already contains `new_state_str` among its elements, and `new_state_str` is a string that has been added to `visited`. The states of `visited` and `new_state_str` are not affected by this operation, but the `queue` is updated by adding `new_state_str` to it.

Output State: **`visited` is a set containing `new_state_str` among its elements, `new_state_str` is a string that has been added to `visited`, `queue` contains `new_state_str` as its last element**
