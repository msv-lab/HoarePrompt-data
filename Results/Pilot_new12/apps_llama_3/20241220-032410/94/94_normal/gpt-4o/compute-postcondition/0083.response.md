Postcondition: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited; `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`; `current` is the last state explored; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2` and `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, where `dr` and `dc` are values from `directions`. The current values of `new_row` and `new_col` are such that `0 <= new_row < 2` and `0 <= new_col < 2`, meaning they are within the bounds of a 2x2 grid.**
