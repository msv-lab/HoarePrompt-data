The given code snippet swaps the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` indices in the `new_state` list.

Given that `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, and `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, the values at these positions are swapped.

The states of `start`, `queue`, `visited`, `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, and the current direction being explored remain unchanged.

After the swap operation, `new_state` will have its elements at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` indices exchanged.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, `queue` is not empty, `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, `directions` is `[(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]`, `current` is the last state explored, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`, `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`, the current direction being explored is `(0, -1)`, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_pos` is `new_row * 2 + new_col`, and `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[new_pos]` and `new_state[new_pos]` is the character that was at `new_state[empty_pos]`.**
