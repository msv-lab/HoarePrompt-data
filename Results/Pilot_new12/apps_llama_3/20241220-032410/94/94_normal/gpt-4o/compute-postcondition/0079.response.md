The line of code `empty_pos = current.index('X')` assigns the index of the character 'X' in the string `current` to the variable `empty_pos`. Since `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', and `current` is the last state explored, which is the state that was previously at the front of `queue`, then `current` can also be a string of length 4. This index will be an integer between 0 and 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and has been updated by removing its leftmost element; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and all reachable states from `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the last state explored, which is the state that was previously at the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`; `empty_row`, and `empty_col` correspond to the last explored state.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is not empty and has been updated by removing its leftmost element; `visited` is a set containing all unique states that have been visited, including `start` and all reachable states from `start`; `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is the last state explored, which is the state that was previously at the front of `queue`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in the string `current`; `empty_row`, and `empty_col` correspond to the last explored state**
