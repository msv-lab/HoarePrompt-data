Postcondition: **`start` is a string of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'; `queue` is an empty deque; `visited` is a set containing `start`; `directions` is a list [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]; `current` is equal to `start`; `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`; `empty_row` is `empty_pos // 2`; `empty_col` is `empty_pos % 2`; `dr` is -1; `dc` is 0; `new_row` is `empty_row - 1`; `new_col` is `empty_col`; `new_pos` is (`empty_pos // 2` - 1) * 2 + `empty_pos % 2`; `new_state` is a list of characters where the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped; `new_state_str` is a string where the elements at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` of `current` have been swapped. The current value of `new_state_str` is not in the `visited` set.**
