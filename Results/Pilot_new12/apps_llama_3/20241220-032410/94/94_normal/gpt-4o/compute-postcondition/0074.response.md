Postcondition: ***`visited` is a set, `new_state_str` is a string. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `new_state_str` is added to `visited` and `queue` contains `new_state_str` as its last element. If `new_state_str` is already in `visited`, then the state of `visited` and `queue` remains unchanged.***
