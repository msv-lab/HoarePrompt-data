Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. 

The issue lies in the condition for printing "YES" or "NO". The code checks if both `bessie_reachable` and `elsie_reachable` are not empty (i.e., `bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable`), but this is not the correct condition to check if there is a common reachable state between the two puzzles.

Instead, the code should check if there is any common element between `bessie_reachable` and `elsie_reachable`. If there is at least one common element, it means that there is a sequence of moves that can transform both puzzles into the same configuration, and the code should print "YES". Otherwise, it should print "NO".

The correct condition should be `if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable` should be replaced with `if bessie_reachable & elsie_reachable!= set()`, or more explicitly, `if not bessie_reachable.isdisjoint(elsie_reachable)`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from collections import deque

bessie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
elsie_puzzle = [input().strip() for _ in range(2)]
bessie_start = func_1(bessie_puzzle)
elsie_start = func_1(elsie_puzzle)
bessie_reachable = func_2(bessie_start)
elsie_reachable = func_2(elsie_start)
if not bessie_reachable.isdisjoint(elsie_reachable):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

Without this correction, the code will not work correctly for some cases, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
