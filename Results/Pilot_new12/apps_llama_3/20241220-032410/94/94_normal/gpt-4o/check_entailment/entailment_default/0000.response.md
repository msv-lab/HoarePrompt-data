Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to correctly solve the problem of determining whether two 2x2 sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration through a sequence of moves. 

Function `func_1` correctly flattens the 2x2 puzzle grid into a single string, which is used as the starting point for the BFS in `func_2`. 

Function `func_2` performs a BFS to find all reachable states from the initial configuration. It correctly handles the movement of the empty space 'X' in all four directions and checks for valid moves within the grid boundaries. 

The main part of the code uses `func_1` to get the starting configurations of both puzzles and `func_2` to find all reachable states from these configurations. It then checks if there is any overlap between the reachable states of the two puzzles. If there is, it prints "YES", indicating that the puzzles can reach the same configuration. Otherwise, it prints "NO".

The code correctly handles all possible configurations of the 2x2 grid puzzle and assumes that the input will always be a valid puzzle configuration. The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the code.

Therefore, based on the given code and examples, it appears that the code is correct and can handle all potential cases.
