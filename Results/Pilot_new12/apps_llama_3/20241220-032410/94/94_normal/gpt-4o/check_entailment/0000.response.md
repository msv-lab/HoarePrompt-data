Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not properly compare the reachable states of both puzzles. The function `func_2` generates all possible reachable states from a given puzzle configuration, but it does not check if the two sets of reachable states intersect.

In the given code, `func_1` simply concatenates the two rows of the puzzle, which is not necessary. The main issue lies in `func_2`, which generates all reachable states but does not compare them between the two puzzles.

To fix this, we should generate all reachable states for both puzzles and check if there is any common state between them. If there is, we can return "YES", indicating that the puzzles can reach the same configuration. If not, we return "NO".

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
from collections import deque

def get_reachable_states(puzzle):
    queue = deque([puzzle])
    visited = set([puzzle])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        (empty_row, empty_col) = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        for (dr, dc) in directions:
            (new_row, new_col) = (empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc)
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                (new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos]) = (new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos])
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
    return visited

def solve(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    reachable_states_1 = get_reachable_states(puzzle1)
    reachable_states_2 = get_reachable_states(puzzle2)
    if reachable_states_1.intersection(reachable_states_2):
        return "YES"
    else:
        return "NO"

# Example usage
puzzle1 = "ABXC"
puzzle2 = "XBAC"
print(solve(puzzle1, puzzle2))  # Output: YES
```

In the given example, the puzzles "ABXC" and "XBAC" can reach the same configuration, so the function returns "YES".
