You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
from collections import deque
#Function 1:
def func_1(puzzle):
    return puzzle[0] + puzzle[1]

#Function 2:
def func_2(start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set([start])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        (empty_row, empty_col) = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        for (dr, dc) in directions:
            (new_row, new_col) = (empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc)
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                (new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos]) = (new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos])
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
    return visited


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The issue with the provided program is that it does not fully solve the problem. The program only generates all possible configurations that can be reached from the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle but does not compare these configurations with the reachable configurations of Elsie's puzzle.

To solve the problem, the program needs to generate all possible configurations for both Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles and then check if there is any common configuration. However, the provided program only generates the configurations for one puzzle and does not compare them with the configurations of the other puzzle.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

If we provide the following input:

```
AB
XC
CA
BX
```

The program will generate all possible configurations for Bessie's puzzle but will not compare them with the configurations of Elsie's puzzle. As a result, the program will not be able to determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration or not.

The correct program should generate all possible configurations for both puzzles and then check if there is any common configuration. If a common configuration is found, the program should output "YES"; otherwise, it should output "NO".

Here's a possible implementation of the correct program:

```python
from collections import deque

def generate_configurations(puzzle):
    queue = deque([puzzle])
    visited = set([puzzle])
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        empty_pos = current.index('X')
        (empty_row, empty_col) = divmod(empty_pos, 2)
        for (dr, dc) in directions:
            (new_row, new_col) = (empty_row + dr, empty_col + dc)
            if 0 <= new_row < 2 and 0 <= new_col < 2:
                new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col
                new_state = list(current)
                (new_state[empty_pos], new_state[new_pos]) = (new_state[new_pos], new_state[empty_pos])
                new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
                if new_state_str not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_state_str)
                    queue.append(new_state_str)
    return visited

def is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    bessie_configurations = generate_configurations(puzzle1)
    elsie_configurations = generate_configurations(puzzle2)
    return not bessie_configurations.isdisjoint(elsie_configurations)

# Read input
bessie_puzzle = input() + input()
elsie_puzzle = input() + input()

# Check if Bessie and Elsie are BFFL
if is_bffl(bessie_puzzle, elsie_puzzle):
    print("YES")
else:
    print("NO")
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a string parameter `start` of length 4, consisting of the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', representing the initial configuration of a 2 × 2 grid puzzle. It returns a set `visited` containing all unique reachable states from the original string `start`, which are obtained by performing a breadth-first search (BFS) in all four directions (up, down, left, right) from the initial state, where 'X' represents an empty space that can be moved to an adjacent position. The function handles all possible configurations of the 2 × 2 grid puzzle, excluding cases where the input string does not meet the specified criteria. The final state of the program includes the original string `start`, an empty queue, and a set `visited` containing all unique reachable states from the original string `start`. The function does not perform any error checking on the input string, so it assumes that the input will always be a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. If the input string does not meet these criteria, the function's behavior may be undefined.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
