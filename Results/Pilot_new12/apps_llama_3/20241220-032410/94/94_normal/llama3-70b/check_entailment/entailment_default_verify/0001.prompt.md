You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
puzzle1 = [input() + input()]
puzzle2 = [input() + input()]
puzzle1 = ''.join(puzzle1).replace('\n', '')
puzzle2 = ''.join(puzzle2).replace('\n', '')
if func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
    (puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2]) = (puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1])
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine if two puzzles can reach the same configuration. The issue lies in the implementation of the `func_1` function.

In the `func_1` function, the program tries to swap the 'X' (empty cell) in both puzzles and then compare if the sorted strings are equal. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual movements of the tiles. The program should instead generate all possible configurations of both puzzles and check if they can reach the same configuration.

A counter example to the given program is:

Input:
```
AB
XC
BX
AC
```
In this case, the program will incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks if the sorted strings are equal after swapping the 'X' in both puzzles. However, the correct output should be "NO" because there is no sequence of moves that can transform the first puzzle into the second puzzle.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to generate all possible configurations of both puzzles and check if they can reach the same configuration. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to generate all possible configurations and check if they can reach the same configuration. 

Here is a possible correct implementation in Python:
```python
from collections import deque

def is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    def is_valid(puzzle):
        return all(char in puzzle for char in 'ABCX')

    def get_neighbors(puzzle):
        neighbors = []
        x_index = puzzle.index('X')
        if x_index > 1:
            new_puzzle = list(puzzle)
            new_puzzle[x_index], new_puzzle[x_index - 2] = new_puzzle[x_index - 2], new_puzzle[x_index]
            neighbors.append(''.join(new_puzzle))
        if x_index < 2:
            new_puzzle = list(puzzle)
            new_puzzle[x_index], new_puzzle[x_index + 2] = new_puzzle[x_index + 2], new_puzzle[x_index]
            neighbors.append(''.join(new_puzzle))
        if x_index % 2 == 0 and x_index < 3:
            new_puzzle = list(puzzle)
            new_puzzle[x_index], new_puzzle[x_index + 1] = new_puzzle[x_index + 1], new_puzzle[x_index]
            neighbors.append(''.join(new_puzzle))
        if x_index % 2 == 1 and x_index > 0:
            new_puzzle = list(puzzle)
            new_puzzle[x_index], new_puzzle[x_index - 1] = new_puzzle[x_index - 1], new_puzzle[x_index]
            neighbors.append(''.join(new_puzzle))
        return neighbors

    def bfs(puzzle, target):
        queue = deque([puzzle])
        visited = {puzzle}
        while queue:
            current_puzzle = queue.popleft()
            if current_puzzle == target:
                return True
            for neighbor in get_neighbors(current_puzzle):
                if is_valid(neighbor) and neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                    visited.add(neighbor)
        return False

    return bfs(puzzle1, puzzle2)

puzzle1 = input() + input()
puzzle2 = input() + input()
if is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two 2x2 grid parameters, puzzle1 and puzzle2, each containing the strings 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. It swaps the 'X' elements between the two grids, regardless of their initial positions. Then, it compares the sorted versions of the two grids and returns True if they are equal, indicating that the swap operation did not change the overall composition of the grids. The function modifies the input grids in-place. However, there are edge cases where the function may not behave as expected: if 'X' is not found in either grid, the variables x1 and x2 will not be defined, leading to an error when trying to access puzzle1[x1] or puzzle2[x2]. Additionally, the function does not check if the input grids are valid 2x2 grids or if they contain exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. If the input grids are not in the expected format, the function may produce incorrect results or errors. The final state of the program after it concludes is that the input grids have been modified, and a boolean value indicating whether the sorted grids are equal is returned.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
