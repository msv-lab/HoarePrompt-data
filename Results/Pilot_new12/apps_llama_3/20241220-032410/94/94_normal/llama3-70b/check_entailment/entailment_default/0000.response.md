Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly determine if two given 2x2 sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration. The function `func_1` simply swaps the positions of the 'X' elements in the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted versions of the puzzles are equal. This approach is not sufficient to solve the problem.

The issue with the code is that it does not consider the actual moves that can be performed on the puzzles. The function only checks if the overall composition of the puzzles is the same after swapping the 'X' elements, but it does not take into account the specific rules of the puzzle, such as the fact that a tile can only be moved into the empty space if it is adjacent to it.

A correct solution would involve exploring all possible moves from the initial configurations of the two puzzles and checking if there exists a sequence of moves that leads to the same configuration. The provided code does not implement this approach and therefore does not correctly solve the problem.

For example, consider the following input:

AB
XC
AC
BX

The code will incorrectly output 'YES' because it only checks if the sorted versions of the puzzles are equal after swapping the 'X' elements, but it does not consider the fact that there is no sequence of moves that can transform the first puzzle into the second puzzle.

In general, the code does not correctly handle cases where the initial configurations of the two puzzles are not connected by a sequence of valid moves. It only checks for the existence of a simple swap operation that makes the puzzles look similar, but it does not verify that this swap operation is actually possible in the context of the puzzle.
