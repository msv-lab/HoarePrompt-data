Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The main issue is with the function `func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2)`. This function attempts to solve the problem by swapping the positions of the 'X' in `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` and then comparing the sorted strings. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual movement of the tiles.

In the problem description, a move is defined as sliding a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell. The function `func_1` does not simulate this movement at all. It simply swaps the 'X' characters and checks if the sorted strings are equal, which is not a valid way to solve the problem.

Moreover, the function does not handle the case where the 'X' character is at the same position in both `puzzle1` and `puzzle2`. In this case, the function will attempt to swap the 'X' characters, but this will not change the state of the puzzles.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to simulate all possible moves and check if we can reach the same configuration. This can be done using a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm or a depth-first search (DFS) algorithm.

Here is an example of how the correct function could be implemented:
```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    def get_neighbors(puzzle):
        neighbors = []
        x_index = puzzle.index('X')
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx = x_index // 2 + dx
            ny = x_index % 2 + dy
            if 0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < 2:
                nx_index = nx * 2 + ny
                neighbor = list(puzzle)
                neighbor[x_index], neighbor[nx_index] = neighbor[nx_index], neighbor[x_index]
                neighbors.append(''.join(neighbor))
        return neighbors

    queue = deque([(puzzle1, 0)])
    visited = set([puzzle1])
    while queue:
        puzzle, steps = queue.popleft()
        if puzzle == puzzle2:
            return True
        for neighbor in get_neighbors(puzzle):
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append((neighbor, steps + 1))
    return False
```
This function uses a BFS algorithm to simulate all possible moves and checks if we can reach the same configuration. If we can, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.
