Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is trying to determine if two sliding puzzles can reach the same configuration. However, the approach taken by the program is incorrect. It simply swaps the positions of the 'X' (empty cell) in the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted strings are equal. This does not take into account the actual moves that can be performed on the puzzles.

For example, consider the input:
```
AB
XC
AC
BX
```
The program will output "NO" which is correct. However, if we consider the input:
```
AC
BX
AB
XC
```
The program will also output "NO" which is incorrect. The correct output should be "YES" because Bessie can slide her 'A' tile down and Elsie can slide her 'C' tile up to reach the same configuration.

A correct approach to solve this problem would be to use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to explore all possible configurations of the puzzles and check if they can reach the same configuration.

The provided program does not handle all possible cases correctly and is therefore incorrect. 

Correct Code would involve more complex steps including:

* Defining the possible moves for the puzzle
* Using a BFS algorithm to explore all possible configurations
* Checking if the two puzzles can reach the same configuration

Here's a basic outline of how the correct code could look:
```python
from collections import deque

def is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    # Define the possible moves for the puzzle
    moves = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
    
    # Convert the puzzles to a more convenient format
    puzzle1 = [list(row) for row in puzzle1]
    puzzle2 = [list(row) for row in puzzle2]
    
    # Find the position of the empty cell in the puzzles
    x1 = None
    x2 = None
    for i in range(2):
        for j in range(2):
            if puzzle1[i][j] == 'X':
                x1 = (i, j)
            if puzzle2[i][j] == 'X':
                x2 = (i, j)
    
    # Perform BFS to explore all possible configurations
    queue = deque([(puzzle1, x1)])
    visited = set()
    while queue:
        puzzle, x = queue.popleft()
        # Check if the puzzle is in the same configuration as the second puzzle
        if puzzle == puzzle2:
            return True
        # Mark the puzzle as visited
        visited.add(tuple(tuple(row) for row in puzzle))
        # Generate all possible next configurations
        for move in moves:
            nx, ny = x[0] + move[0], x[1] + move[1]
            if 0 <= nx < 2 and 0 <= ny < 2:
                next_puzzle = [row[:] for row in puzzle]
                next_puzzle[x[0]][x[1]], next_puzzle[nx][ny] = next_puzzle[nx][ny], next_puzzle[x[0]][x[1]]
                next_x = (nx, ny)
                # Check if the next configuration has been visited
                if tuple(tuple(row) for row in next_puzzle) not in visited:
                    queue.append((next_puzzle, next_x))
    
    return False

puzzle1 = [input() for _ in range(2)]
puzzle2 = [input() for _ in range(2)]
if is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
