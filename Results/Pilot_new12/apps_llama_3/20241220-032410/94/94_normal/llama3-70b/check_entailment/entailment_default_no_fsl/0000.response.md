Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. The main issue is that the function `func_1` swaps the 'X' elements between the two grids, which is not the intended operation. According to the problem description, the goal is to check if there exists a sequence of moves that takes the puzzles to the same configuration. However, the code only checks if the sorted versions of the two grids are equal after swapping the 'X' elements.

A correct implementation would involve checking all possible sequences of moves to see if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. The provided code does not do this and instead relies on a simple swap operation and comparison of sorted grids, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

One potential case where the code does not work correctly is when the puzzles are in a configuration where the 'X' element is in a corner, and the other elements are arranged in a way that requires multiple moves to reach the same configuration. In this case, the code would not be able to find a solution because it only checks for a single swap operation and does not consider the possibility of multiple moves.

For example, if the input is:
```
AX
BC
AC
BX
```
The code would not be able to find a solution because it would swap the 'X' elements, resulting in an incorrect configuration, and then compare the sorted grids, which would not be equal.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
