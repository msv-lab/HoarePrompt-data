Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine if two puzzles can reach the same configuration. The issue lies in the implementation of the `func_1` function.

In the `func_1` function, the program tries to swap the 'X' (empty cell) in both puzzles and then compare if the sorted strings are equal. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual movements of the tiles. The program should instead generate all possible configurations of both puzzles and check if they can reach the same configuration.

A counter example to the given program is:

Input:
```
AB
XC
BX
AC
```
In this case, the program will incorrectly output "YES" because it only checks if the sorted strings are equal after swapping the 'X' in both puzzles. However, the correct output should be "NO" because there is no sequence of moves that can transform the first puzzle into the second puzzle.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to generate all possible configurations of both puzzles and check if they can reach the same configuration. We can use a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm to generate all possible configurations and check if they can reach the same configuration. 

Here is a possible correct implementation in Python:
```python
from collections import deque

def is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    def is_valid(puzzle):
        return all(char in puzzle for char in 'ABCX')

    def get_neighbors(puzzle):
        neighbors = []
        x_index = puzzle.index('X')
        if x_index > 1:
            new_puzzle = list(puzzle)
            new_puzzle[x_index], new_puzzle[x_index - 2] = new_puzzle[x_index - 2], new_puzzle[x_index]
            neighbors.append(''.join(new_puzzle))
        if x_index < 2:
            new_puzzle = list(puzzle)
            new_puzzle[x_index], new_puzzle[x_index + 2] = new_puzzle[x_index + 2], new_puzzle[x_index]
            neighbors.append(''.join(new_puzzle))
        if x_index % 2 == 0 and x_index < 3:
            new_puzzle = list(puzzle)
            new_puzzle[x_index], new_puzzle[x_index + 1] = new_puzzle[x_index + 1], new_puzzle[x_index]
            neighbors.append(''.join(new_puzzle))
        if x_index % 2 == 1 and x_index > 0:
            new_puzzle = list(puzzle)
            new_puzzle[x_index], new_puzzle[x_index - 1] = new_puzzle[x_index - 1], new_puzzle[x_index]
            neighbors.append(''.join(new_puzzle))
        return neighbors

    def bfs(puzzle, target):
        queue = deque([puzzle])
        visited = {puzzle}
        while queue:
            current_puzzle = queue.popleft()
            if current_puzzle == target:
                return True
            for neighbor in get_neighbors(current_puzzle):
                if is_valid(neighbor) and neighbor not in visited:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                    visited.add(neighbor)
        return False

    return bfs(puzzle1, puzzle2)

puzzle1 = input() + input()
puzzle2 = input() + input()
if is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
