#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are each 2x2 grids represented as 2D lists of strings, where each string is one of 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X', and each grid contains exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `i` is 3, `x1` is the index of the last 'X' in `puzzle1` if it exists, `x2` is the index of the last 'X' in `puzzle2` if it exists.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two 2x2 grid parameters, puzzle1 and puzzle2, each containing the strings 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. It swaps the 'X' elements between the two grids, regardless of their initial positions. Then, it compares the sorted versions of the two grids and returns True if they are equal, indicating that the swap operation did not change the overall composition of the grids. The function modifies the input grids in-place. However, there are edge cases where the function may not behave as expected: if 'X' is not found in either grid, the variables x1 and x2 will not be defined, leading to an error when trying to access puzzle1[x1] or puzzle2[x2]. Additionally, the function does not check if the input grids are valid 2x2 grids or if they contain exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'. If the input grids are not in the expected format, the function may produce incorrect results or errors. The final state of the program after it concludes is that the input grids have been modified, and a boolean value indicating whether the sorted grids are equal is returned.
