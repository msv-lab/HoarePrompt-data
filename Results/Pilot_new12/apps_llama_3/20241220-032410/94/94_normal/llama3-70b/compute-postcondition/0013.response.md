The code `x1 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `x1`. Since `i` is 2, `x1` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `i` is 2, `x1` is 2, if the current value of `puzzle2` at index `i` is 'X', then `x2` is 1, if the current value of `puzzle1` at index `i` is 'X' and the current value of `puzzle2` at index `i` is not 'X', then `x2` is 0, if the current value of `puzzle1` at index `i` is not 'X', then `x2` is not necessarily 0 or 1**
