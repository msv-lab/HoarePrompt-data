The value of `x2` is updated to be equal to `i`. The value of `i` is 1, so `x2` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `i` is 1, if the current value of `puzzle1` at index `i` is 'X', then `x1` is 1, `x2` is 1**
