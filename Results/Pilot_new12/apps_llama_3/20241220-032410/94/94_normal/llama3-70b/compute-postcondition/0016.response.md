Postcondition: ***`puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `i` is 2. If `puzzle2` at index `i` is 'X', then `x1` is either 1 or 2 and `x2` is 1. If `puzzle2` at index `i` is not 'X' and `puzzle1` at index `i` is 'X', then `x1` is 2 and `x2` is 0. If `puzzle2` at index `i` is not 'X' and `puzzle1` at index `i` is not 'X', then the values of `x1` and `x2` are not determined by this condition, but initially `x1` is 1 and `x2` is either 0 or 1.***
