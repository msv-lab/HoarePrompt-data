Postcondition: ***`puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `i` is 0. If the current value of `puzzle2` at index `i` is 'X', then `x2` is 0. If the current value of `puzzle1` at index `i` is 'X', then `x1` is 0.***
