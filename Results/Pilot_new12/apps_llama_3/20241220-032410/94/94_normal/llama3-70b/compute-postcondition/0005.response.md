The code `x2 = i` assigns the value of `i` to `x2`. Since `i` is 0, `x2` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`puzzle1` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `puzzle2` is a 2x2 grid with exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X', `i` is 0, `x2` is 0, if the current value of `puzzle1` at index `i` is 'X', then the current value of `x1` is 0, and the current value of `puzzle2` at index `i` is 'X'**
