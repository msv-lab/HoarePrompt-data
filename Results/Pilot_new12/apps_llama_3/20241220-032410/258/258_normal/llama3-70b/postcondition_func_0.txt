The function calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between two points in a two-dimensional plane, represented by the coordinates (x, y) and (X, Y), where x, y, X, and Y are real numbers. The function accepts four parameters (x, y, X, Y) and returns a single value representing the distance between these two points. The function handles all possible real number inputs for the coordinates, including negative numbers and zero, and returns the correct Euclidean distance. It does not perform any error checking on the inputs, so it assumes that the provided coordinates are valid real numbers. The function does not modify the input parameters, and its execution does not have any side effects on the program state beyond returning the calculated distance.
