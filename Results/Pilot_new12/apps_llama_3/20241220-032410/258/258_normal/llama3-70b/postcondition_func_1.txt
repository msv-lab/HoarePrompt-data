The function takes in four parameters: two lists of integers `x` and `y` representing the x and y coordinates of pieces of meat, and two real numbers `X` and `Y` representing the coordinates of a heat source. However, the function's execution implicitly depends on a predefined list `meats` containing tuples of x and y coordinates and hardness `c` of each piece of meat. The function returns a list of values, where each value is the product of the hardness `c` of a piece of meat and the result of the function `func_1` applied to the x and y coordinates of the piece of meat and the coordinates `X` and `Y` of the heat source. The function does not modify the input lists `x` and `y`, or the coordinates `X` and `Y`. It also does not validate the inputs or handle potential edge cases such as empty input lists, non-integer or non-real number values, or non-positive hardness values. The function assumes that `meats` is a predefined list and `func_1` is a predefined function, and it does not provide any error handling if these assumptions are not met. The final state of the program after the function concludes is a returned list of calculated values, without any modifications to the input parameters or the external state.
