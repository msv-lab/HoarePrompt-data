Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue is with the function `func_3()`, which tries to find the minimum time by iterating over all integer pairs `(x, y)` in the range -1000 to 1000. However, the problem description states that `X` and `Y` are real numbers, not integers. This means that the function `func_3()` may not be able to find the optimal solution if the optimal `X` and `Y` are not integers.

For example, consider the case where the optimal `X` is -0.2, as mentioned in the sample output. The function `func_3()` will not be able to find this solution because it only checks integer values of `X` and `Y`.

Another issue is that the function `func_2(x, y, X, Y)` is not correctly defined in the code. The function should take in the list of meats and return a list of times, but the code is using the variables `x` and `y` as if they were lists of coordinates, which is not the case.

Overall, the code has several issues that prevent it from correctly solving the problem for every potential case.
