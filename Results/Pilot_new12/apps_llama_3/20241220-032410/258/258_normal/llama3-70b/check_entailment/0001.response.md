Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It seems to be attempting to find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if the heat source is placed to minimize this time. However, there are several issues with the provided code.

Firstly, the `func_2` function appears to be attempting to calculate the cooking times for all pieces of meat, but it's using the coordinates of a single piece of meat (`x`, `y`) instead of using the coordinates of each piece of meat. It should be iterating over all pieces of meat.

Secondly, in `func_3`, the heat source is placed at integer coordinates, which may not be optimal. The problem description states that `X` and `Y` can be real numbers.

Lastly, the code doesn't actually use the provided input values (`meats` seems to be a global variable, but its value is not provided).

To fix this, we need to rewrite the code to use the correct coordinates for each piece of meat and to search over all possible real coordinates for the heat source, not just integer values.

Here's a corrected version of the code:
```python
import math
import itertools

def func_1(x, y, X, Y, c):
    return c * math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)

def func_2(X, Y, meats):
    return [func_1(x, y, X, Y, c) for x, y, c in meats]

def func_3(meats, K, N):
    min_time = float('inf')
    for (x, y, c) in itertools.product(range(-1000, 1001), range(-1000, 1001), [1]):
        times = func_2(x / 10.0, y / 10.0, meats) # search over all possible real coordinates
        times.sort()
        if times[K - 1] < min_time:
            min_time = times[K - 1]
    return min_time

N, K = map(int, input().split())
meats = []
for _ in range(N):
    x, y, c = map(int, input().split())
    meats.append((x, y, c))
print(func_3(meats, K, N))
```
However, please note that this version of the function is still inefficient because it tries all integer coordinates within a certain range. There are more efficient algorithms to find the optimal solution, such as gradient descent or other optimization algorithms.

This problem is complex and requires careful consideration of all possible cases, and possibly more advanced algorithms to solve it efficiently. The provided code does not handle the problem correctly.
