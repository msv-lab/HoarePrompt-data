Correctness: **False**

The program does not do what the problem description says for every potential case.

The problem description requires finding the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if the heat source is placed to minimize this time. However, the given program does not correctly implement this requirement.

The issue lies in the `func_3` function, where it iterates over all possible integer coordinates for the heat source from -1000 to 1000. However, the problem description states that X and Y are real numbers, not integers. This means that the program is not considering all possible placements of the heat source, only those with integer coordinates.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider all possible real number coordinates for the heat source. However, this would require a more complex algorithm, possibly involving numerical optimization techniques, as the problem is a non-linear optimization problem.

Another issue is that the `func_2` function is called with `x` and `y` as coordinates of the heat source, but `x` and `y` are also used as variables in the function to represent the coordinates of the pieces of meat. This can lead to confusion and incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not correctly follow the problem description and is not correct.
