Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The code provided attempts to find the minimum time required to grill K or more pieces of meat by iterating over all possible integer coordinates (-1000 <= x, y <= 1000) for the heat source. However, the problem description asks for the minimum time required to grill K or more pieces of meat when the heat source is placed at coordinates (X, Y), where X and Y are real numbers.

The issue lies in the implementation of `func_3()`, where the function iterates over all possible integer pairs `(x, y)` such that -1000 <= x, y <= 1000. This approach does not account for the possibility of the heat source being placed at non-integer coordinates.

In the given sample input, the optimal place to put the heat source is at `(-0.2, 0)`, which is a non-integer coordinate. The provided code, however, only checks integer coordinates, and therefore may not find the optimal solution.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should be able to handle real number coordinates for the heat source, not just integers. This could involve using a more sophisticated optimization technique, such as gradient descent or a grid search with finer granularity, to find the optimal coordinates.

Since the code does not handle this case correctly, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
