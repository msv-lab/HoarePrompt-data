The value of `times` is sorted in ascending order. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**
