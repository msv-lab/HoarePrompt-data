To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `ans` is `times[K - 1]`
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`

The code snippet provided is:
```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

Given `x` is -1000 and `y` is -999, the code calls `func_2` with the arguments `-1000`, `-999`, `-1000`, and `-999`. The return value of this function call, which is presumably a list or array of times, is then assigned to the variable `times`.

However, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine the explicit values that `times` will hold. Nonetheless, we can infer the following based on the given initial state and the code:

- The value of `x` remains -1000.
- The value of `y` remains -999.
- The constraints on `K` and `N` remain unchanged, as the code does not modify these variables directly.
- The value of `ans` was initially `times[K - 1]`, but since `times` is reassigned, `ans` would need to be recalculated based on the new `times` to maintain its initial relationship. However, the code does not update `ans` directly.
- The variable `times` now holds the return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, which replaces its previous value.

Since the exact return value of `func_2` is not specified, we can only describe the change in `times` qualitatively. The rest of the variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans`) maintain their initial state descriptions, with the exception that `ans`'s relationship to `times` would be outdated until it is recalculated.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `ans` was `times[K - 1]` before the update of `times`, `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`**
