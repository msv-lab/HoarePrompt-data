To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions:

- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -998
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`
- `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and the value at index `K - 1` in the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`

The given code is `times.sort()`. This line of code sorts the list `times` in ascending order.

From the initial conditions, we know that `times` is the return value of a function call, but the actual values or structures returned by `func_2` are not provided. However, we can infer that `times` is a list because it has a `sort()` method.

After executing `times.sort()`, the list `times` will be sorted in ascending order. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by this operation, assuming there are no side effects or indirect modifications through other parts of the code not shown here.

The output state, focusing on the changes and considering the information provided, is:

- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -998
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`
- `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and the value at index `K - 1` in the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted list of return values from `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, `ans` remains as defined, with `times` now sorted in ascending order.**
