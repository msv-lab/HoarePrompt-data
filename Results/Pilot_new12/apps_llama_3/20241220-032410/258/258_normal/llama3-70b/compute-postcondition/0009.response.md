To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state: 
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`
- `ans` is the value of `times[K - 1]` before the sorting of `times`

The code to be executed is: 
```
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

This line of code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `times[K - 1]`. 

Since `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, and assuming that the function returns values in a way that sorting them makes sense (for example, if the function returns numerical values), `times[K - 1]` would be the Kth smallest value returned by `func_2` after sorting.

The initial value of `ans` is the value of `times[K - 1]` before sorting. Since `times` is sorted, the value of `times[K - 1]` after sorting could be different from its value before sorting, depending on the output of `func_2`.

However, without knowing the exact behavior of `func_2`, we can say that `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its initial value (which is a specific value from the unsorted output of `func_2`) and the Kth smallest value in the sorted output of `func_2`.

The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and the sorted `times` do not change, as the code only updates `ans`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`
- `ans` is the minimum of its initial value (`times[K - 1]` before sorting) and the Kth smallest value in the sorted `times`.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and `times[K - 1]`.**
