To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the output states after the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over all possible values of `y` from -1000 to 1000. For each `y`, it calculates `times` as the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, sorts `times`, and then updates `ans` to be the minimum of the current `ans` and `times[K - 1]`.

From the output states after the first few iterations, we can see that:

* `x` remains constant at -999.
* `y` takes on the current value in the range -1000 to 1000.
* `K` and `N` remain constant, with `K` being a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
* `times` is recalculated and sorted for each `y`.
* `ans` is updated to be the minimum of the current `ans` and `times[K - 1]`.

After all iterations have finished, the final value of `y` will be 1000. The final value of `times` will be the sorted result of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`. The final value of `ans` will be the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., the range of `y` is empty), the values of the variables will remain the same as their initial values.

Therefore, the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished is:

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, and `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000.**
