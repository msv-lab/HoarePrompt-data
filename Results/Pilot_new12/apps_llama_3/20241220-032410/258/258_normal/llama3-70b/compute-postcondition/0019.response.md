To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the program.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` equals sorted `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`
- `ans` is `times[0]`

And the code:
```python
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

This code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value (`times[0]`) and the value of `times` at index `K - 1`.

Since `times` is sorted and `ans` initially equals `times[0]`, which is the smallest value in the sorted list, `ans` will only change if `times[K - 1]` is smaller than `times[0]`. However, given that `times` is sorted, `times[0]` is the smallest value, and thus `times[K - 1]` cannot be smaller than `times[0]`. Therefore, the value of `ans` will remain `times[0]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` equals sorted `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`, and `ans` is `times[0]`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` equals sorted `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`, and `ans` is `times[0]`**
