To solve this problem, we'll consider the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`
- `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`

The code provided is:
```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

From the initial state, we know `x` is -998 and `y` is -999. Thus, the function `func_2` is called with the arguments `(-998, -999, -998, -999)`.

Since the initial state specifies that `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, and now `times` is being reassigned to `func_2(x, y, x, y)` where `x = -998` and `y = -999`, we can infer that the new `times` will have the same input values as before because `x` and `y` haven't changed. Therefore, `times` is being reassigned the result of the same function call it initially represented.

However, the definition or behavior of `func_2` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact values that `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)` returns. Given this, `times` will now hold the result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, which is the same as its initial state in terms of input parameters, but its sorted nature is explicitly stated in the initial condition.

The other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, `ans`) are not directly affected by this reassignment of `times`.

Thus, considering the provided information and the nature of the code snippet, the output state after executing the given Python code is:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`
- `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`.**
