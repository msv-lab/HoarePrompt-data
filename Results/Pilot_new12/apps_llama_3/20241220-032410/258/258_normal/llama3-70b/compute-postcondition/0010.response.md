To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for y in range(-1000, 1001):`, which means `y` will take on values from -1000 to 1000.

At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, and `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and `times[K - 1]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` should be incremented by 1. So, `y` becomes -998.

The values of `x`, `K`, `N`, `times`, and `ans` do not depend on the loop variable `y`, so they remain the same.

State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and `times[K - 1]`**
