According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is -999. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1. So, `x` is -998. The other variables `y`, `K`, `N`, `times`, and `ans` do not depend on the loop variable `x`, so their states remain the same.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is 1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, and `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000**
