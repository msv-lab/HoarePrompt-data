To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`
- `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000 based on the initial calculation of `times`

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

This line of code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

Given that `ans` initially is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000, and considering `times` and `K` are based on specific calculations and constraints, the update operation essentially ensures that `ans` remains the minimum value it can be based on the conditions provided.

The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `times` are not changed by the given code snippet. Only the value of `ans` could potentially be updated if `times[K - 1]` is less than the current `ans`.

Therefore, the output state, considering all provided information and the potential update to `ans`, is:
Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, and `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`.**
