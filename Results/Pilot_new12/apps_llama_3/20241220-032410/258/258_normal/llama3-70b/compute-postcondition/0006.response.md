According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is -999.
State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**
