The function `func_3` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but based on the problem description, it relies on the values of x, y, and K. x and y are integers within the range -1000 to 1000, and K is a non-negative integer between 1 and N, where N represents the total number of pieces of meat. 

Given the constraints and the output description, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in the problem statement, as the function `func_3` is defined without parameters, but the output depends on x, y, and K. 

However, interpreting the task as describing the functionality based on the given constraints and output:

The function `func_3` returns the minimum of the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted times lists across all possible x and y values from -1000 to 1000, with x being 1000 and y being 1000, and K being a non-negative integer such that 1 <= K <= N, where N is a non-negative integer representing the total number of pieces of meat.

Functionality: **The function returns the minimum of the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted times lists for x = 1000, y = 1000, and 1 <= K <= N.**
