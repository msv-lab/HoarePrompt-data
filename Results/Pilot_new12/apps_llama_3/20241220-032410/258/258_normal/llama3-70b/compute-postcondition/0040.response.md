The code `times.sort()` sorts the `times` list in ascending order. The initial state provides that `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, but it does not specify the exact output of this function. After sorting, the list `times` will be in ascending order, but its elements' values remain unspecified except for their order.

Given `x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, and `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list, the sorting operation does not directly affect `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, or `ans`. However, since `ans` depends on the (K-1)th smallest element in the `times` list, and this list has been sorted, the value or the potential value of `ans` may change if it is re-evaluated after sorting. But without further operations, the values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and the relation defining `ans` remain as initially stated.

Since `times` is now sorted, if we were to re-evaluate `ans` with this sorted list, `ans` would be the minimum between its previous value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the now sorted `times` list. But based on the given code snippet, we only know that `times` has been sorted, not that `ans` or any other variables were re-evaluated.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is a sorted list resulting from `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, and `ans` is defined as the minimum between its previous minimum value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list.**
