To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given for loop statement. The loop iterates over a range of values for `y`, from -1000 to 1000 (inclusive). 

Given the initial states:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is 1000
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000

For the loop to execute, it doesn't directly depend on the values of `x`, `K`, `N`, or `ans`, but rather on the range specified in the loop, which is already defined. However, since `y` is the variable being iterated over, its initial state is relevant to the loop's execution context.

At the start of the loop, `y` will be -1000, as that's the first value in the specified range. The loop will iterate over all integers from -1000 to 1000, inclusive. 

The state of `x`, `K`, `N`, and `ans` does not affect the execution of the loop in terms of whether it can start or not; it's the iteration variable `y` and the defined range that matter.

Therefore, considering the loop's first iteration, the adjusted state would reflect the starting point of `y` within the loop's context, even though `y`'s initial value outside the loop is 1000. The loop doesn't care about the external value of `y` once it starts; it will use its own iteration variable starting from -1000.

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000**
