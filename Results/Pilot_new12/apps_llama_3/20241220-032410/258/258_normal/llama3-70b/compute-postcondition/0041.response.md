To solve this, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -998
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is a sorted list resulting from `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`
- `ans` is defined as the minimum between its previous minimum value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list.

Given the code:
```python
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

This line updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value at index `K-1` in the `times` list.

Since `times` is a sorted list, the (K-1)th smallest element in `times` is `times[K - 1]`. 

Therefore, `ans` will be updated to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.

The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `times` are not changed by the code.

Thus, the output state, considering the updated value of `ans`, is:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -998
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is a sorted list resulting from `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`
- `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`.

However, to be more specific about `ans`, if we denote the previous value of `ans` as `ans_prev`, then `ans` will be `min(ans_prev, times[K - 1])`.

So, the Output State is: 
**`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is a sorted list resulting from `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, and `ans` is `min(ans_prev, times[K - 1])`.**
