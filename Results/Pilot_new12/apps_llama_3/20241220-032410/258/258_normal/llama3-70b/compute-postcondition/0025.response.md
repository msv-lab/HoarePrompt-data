To determine the output state, let's consider the impact of the given code on the program.

The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` assigns the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to the variable `times`. Given that initially, `times` is a sorted list of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, this line of code changes the value of `times` to the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where `x` is -999 and `y` is -998.

The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called with arguments `x = -999`, `y = -998`, `x = -999`, and `y = -998`. 

Since the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we can't determine the exact output of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`. However, we can state that `times` now holds the result of this function call.

The other variables, `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans`, are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, their values or properties remain as initially stated.

Given this analysis, the output state is: `x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, and `ans` is the minimum of the smallest element of the unsorted `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)` and `times[K - 1]` before the change in `times`.

However, since `times` has changed, the value of `ans` which depends on `times[K - 1]` might also change. But without knowing the exact output of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)` and without the specific implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine the new value of `ans`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, and `ans` is the minimum of the smallest element of the unsorted `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)` and the new `times[K - 1]`.**
