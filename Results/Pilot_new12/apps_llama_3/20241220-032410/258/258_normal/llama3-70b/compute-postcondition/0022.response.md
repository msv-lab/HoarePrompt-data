The code snippet provided sorts the list `times` in ascending order. 

Given the initial state: 
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`
- `ans` was initially `times[0]` before the update of `times`

The sorting operation only affects the `times` list. Since `times` is a result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, and we do not have the definition of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact initial values of `times`. However, after sorting, the elements of `times` will be in ascending order.

Other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, `ans`) are not affected by the sorting operation. Note that `ans` was initially set to `times[0]` before the sorting operation. After sorting, `times[0]` will be the smallest element in the `times` list, but `ans` remains unchanged as it was set before the sorting.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is a sorted list of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, and `ans` is the smallest element of the unsorted `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`**
