The code snippet `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. The initial state of the variables is: `x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `ans` was `times[K - 1]` before the update of `times`, `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`. 

After sorting `times`, the order of its elements is changed, but the values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans` remain the same. 

However, since `ans` was `times[K - 1]` before the update of `times` and `times` has been sorted, `ans` may not be equal to `times[K - 1]` after sorting unless `times` was already sorted.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, `ans` is the value of `times[K - 1]` before the sorting of `times`.**
