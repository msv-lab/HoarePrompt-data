The `times` list, which is the result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, is sorted in ascending order. The values of the other variables are not directly affected by this operation. 

The function `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)` and its relation to `times` and `ans` are mentioned but since the sorting operation only affects the `times` list, we'll focus on that.

Given that `times` was the result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)` and now it's sorted, and `ans` is determined by the minimum of the smallest element of the unsorted result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)` and the new `times[K - 1]`, the sorting of `times` changes the values that can be accessed by `times[K - 1]`. 

However, without knowing the specific values returned by `func_2`, we can't determine the exact values in `times` or `ans` after the sorting. The sorting operation itself doesn't change the values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, or `ans`, but it does change the order of elements in `times`, which could affect `ans` if `ans` is reassessed after sorting.

Therefore, after the `times.sort()` operation:

- `x` remains -999.
- `y` remains -998.
- `K` remains a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `N` remains a non-negative integer.
- `times` is now sorted in ascending order, being the result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`.
- `ans` is the minimum of the smallest element of the unsorted `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)` and the new `times[K - 1]`, but since `times` is now sorted, `times[K - 1]` could be different, potentially affecting `ans` if recalculated.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`, and `ans` is the minimum of the smallest element of the unsorted `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)` and the new `times[K - 1]`.**
