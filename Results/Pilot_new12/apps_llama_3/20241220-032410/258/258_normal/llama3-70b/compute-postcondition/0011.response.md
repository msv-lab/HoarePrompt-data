To determine the impact of the code on the program, let's break it down:

1. The function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` is called with the arguments `x = -1000`, `y = -998`, `x = -1000`, and `y = -998`.
2. Since the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we will denote its return value as `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`.
3. The return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)` is assigned to the variable `times`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -998
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`
- `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and `times[K - 1]`

After executing the code:
- The value of `times` changes to the return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`.
- Other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, `ans`) do not change their values based on the given code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and the value at index `K - 1` in the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum of its initial value and the value at index `K - 1` in the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`**
