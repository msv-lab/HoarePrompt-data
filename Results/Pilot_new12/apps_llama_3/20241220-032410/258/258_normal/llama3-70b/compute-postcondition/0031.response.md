To understand the impact of the code on the program, let's break it down:

1. The initial state includes `x` as -998, `y` as -1000, `K` as a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` as a non-negative integer, `times` as the sorted result of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, and `ans` as the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000.

2. The code provided is `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)`. This line updates the value of `times` by calling the function `func_2` with the current values of `x` and `y` as arguments.

Given the initial state and the code, we can deduce the following:

- The value of `x` is -998.
- The value of `y` is -1000.
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `N` is a non-negative integer.
- The initial value of `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, but this is updated by the code.
- `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000, but since `times` is updated, `ans` might need to be recalculated based on the new `times`.

After executing `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)`, the value of `times` is updated to be the result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`. The other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans`) do not change directly because of this line of code. However, the calculation of `ans` might be affected because it depends on `times`, which has been updated.

The new `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`. Without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2`, we cannot provide a specific value for `times`. However, we can state that `times` now holds this new value.

The value of `ans` is still considered as the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000, but since `times` has been updated, if `ans` were to be recalculated based on the new `times`, it could potentially change. However, the code provided does not explicitly recalculate `ans`, so its value remains as initially defined unless further operations are performed.

Given these considerations:

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, and `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000 based on the initial calculation of `times`.**
