According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of the loop. The loop will execute if the range is valid, i.e., the start value (-1000) is less than the end value (1001). Since the loop iterates over `y`, the initial value of `y` (1000) is not relevant to the loop's execution. However, for the loop to execute, `y` must be initialized to the start value of the range, which is -1000.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, 1000, -999, 1000)`, and `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000**
