To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `ans` is positive infinity

The code snippet is:
```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

Without the definition of `func_2`, we can only infer that `times` is assigned the return value of `func_2` when called with arguments `x`, `y`, `x`, and `y`. Since `x` and `y` are both -1000, the function `func_2` is essentially called with the same values for all its parameters: `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.

However, since the specifics of `func_2` are unknown, we cannot determine the exact value that `times` will be assigned. 

The states of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation as it only involves assigning a return value from a function to a new variable `times`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `ans` is positive infinity
- `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is positive infinity, `times` is the return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**
