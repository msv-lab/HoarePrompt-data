To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state provided.

The initial state is as follows:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`
- `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list

The code snippet is:
```python
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

Given this information:
- The value of `ans` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and the (K-1)th element of the `times` list.
- The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `times` do not change.

The output state, therefore, includes all the initial conditions except for `ans`, which is updated. Since `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `K - 1` will be a valid index for the `times` list if `K` is within the bounds of the list's indices (considering list indices start at 0). 

Given the nature of `times` and `ans`, and without the specific output of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)` or the initial value of `ans`, we can't calculate a precise value for `ans`. However, we can describe its new state as the minimum between its previous state and the (K-1)th smallest element in `times`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, and `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list.**
