To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000

The code snippet is:
```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

This line of code assigns the result of the function `func_2(x, y, x, y)` to the variable `times`. 

However, without the definition of `func_2`, we cannot directly compute the value of `times`. But we can still describe the outcome in terms of the function's result.

Given that `x` is -999 and `y` is -1000, the function call `func_2(x, y, x, y)` essentially becomes `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`. 

Thus, the variable `times` will hold the result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`.

The states of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans` are not directly affected by this operation, as none of these variables are being reassigned or modified within the given code snippet.

Therefore, after executing the given code, the output state can be described as follows:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000, but this description is pending the actual computation of `times` which now equals `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`
- `times` equals the result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000 where `times` equals `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`**
