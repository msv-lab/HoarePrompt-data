To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -999
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` equals sorted `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`
- `ans` is `times[0]`

The code snippet is:
```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```

Given that `x` is -999 and `y` is -999, we substitute these values into the function call:
```python
times = func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)
```

Since the initial state of `times` was defined as `times` equals sorted `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`, and now `times` is reassigned to `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, the value of `times` changes.

However, without the specific definition of `func_2`, we cannot directly compute the value of `times`. Thus, we express the output state based on the given information:

- `x` remains -999
- `y` remains -999
- `K` remains a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` remains a non-negative integer
- `times` is now equal to `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`
- `ans` was initially `times[0]`, but since `times` has changed, `ans` is no longer necessarily `times[0]` unless explicitly updated.

Therefore, the Output State, considering the information provided and the changes made by the code, is:
Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, and `ans` was initially `times[0]` before the update of `times`.**
