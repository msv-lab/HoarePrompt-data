The code `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)` updates the value of `times` by calling the function `func_2` with the current values of `x` and `y`. 

Since `x` is -998 and `y` is -998, `times` becomes the result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`. 

The initial state defines `times` as the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, but now `times` is updated to be the result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, which is the same as its initial definition.

The states of the other variables, `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans`, are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, and `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list**
