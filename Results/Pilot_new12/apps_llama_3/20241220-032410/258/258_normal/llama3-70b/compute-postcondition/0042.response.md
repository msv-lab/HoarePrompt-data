To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and its effects on the variables.

The loop iterates over the range of `y` from -1000 to 1000. In each iteration, it calculates `times` using `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, sorts `times`, and then updates `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list.

The key observation here is that `ans` is updated in each iteration to be the minimum of its current value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list. This means that after all iterations, `ans` will hold the minimum value of the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` lists across all iterations.

The values of `x`, `K`, and `N` do not change during the loop. The value of `y` changes in each iteration, but its final value after the loop will be 1000, since the loop iterates over the range of `y` from -1000 to 1000.

The value of `times` is recalculated in each iteration, so its final value after the loop will be the sorted result of `func_2(x, 1000, x, 1000)`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is 1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, 1000, -998, 1000)`, and `ans` is the minimum of the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` lists across all iterations of `y` from -1000 to 1000.**
