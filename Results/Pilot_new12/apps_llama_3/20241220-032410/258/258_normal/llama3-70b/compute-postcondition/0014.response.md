To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code iterates over all possible values of `y` from -1000 to 1000. In each iteration, it calculates `times` by calling `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, sorts `times`, and updates `ans` with the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

From the output states for the first few iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

- `x` remains constant at -1000 throughout the loop.
- `y` takes on values from -1000 to 1000 in each iteration.
- `K` and `N` are non-negative integers such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and their values do not change during the loop.
- `ans` is initially positive infinity and gets updated with the minimum of its current value and `times[K - 1]` in each iteration.
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for the current `y`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, `y` will have taken on all values from -1000 to 1000. The value of `ans` will be the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all iterations, where `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, y, -1000, y)` for each `y`.

If the loop does not execute (which is not possible given the range of `y` but could be considered if the range were empty or if there were a conditional break), the values of the variables would be as initially set: `x` is -1000, `y` is unspecified (as it's iterated and not set before the loop), `K` and `N` retain their initial values, and `ans` remains positive infinity because it's not updated.

Considering the loop will execute for all `y` from -1000 to 1000, the final state of `ans` will be the minimum `K-1`th element of the sorted lists returned by `func_2(-1000, y, -1000, y)` for all `y` in the range. The original value of `y` before the loop starts is not directly relevant to its final state since `y` is iterated over a fixed range.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000, where `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, y, -1000, y)`**
