According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000, `x` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, and `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `y` must be increased by 1. So, `y` is -999.
State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, and `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`**
