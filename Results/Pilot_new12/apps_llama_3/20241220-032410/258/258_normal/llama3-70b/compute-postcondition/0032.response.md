The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. The initial state is: `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, and `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000 based on the initial calculation of `times`. 

After the code is executed, `times` will be sorted, but the values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the sorting operation. The value of `times` is now sorted, but its specific values are still the result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, and `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000 based on the initial calculation of `times`.
Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, and `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000 based on the initial calculation of `times`.**
