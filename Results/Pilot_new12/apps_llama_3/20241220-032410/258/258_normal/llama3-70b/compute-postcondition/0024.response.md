According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1. So, `y` should be -998 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is a sorted list of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`, and `ans` is the minimum of the smallest element of the unsorted `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)` and `times[K - 1]`**
