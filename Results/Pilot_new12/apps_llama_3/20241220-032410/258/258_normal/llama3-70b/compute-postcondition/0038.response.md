To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for y in range(-1000, 1001):`, which means `y` will take on integer values from -1000 to 1000, inclusive.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is -998.
- `y` is -999.
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `N` is a non-negative integer.
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`.
- `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to increment by 1, since it's currently at -999 and the loop will continue as long as `y` is less than 1001.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `x` remains -998, as its value is not affected by the loop.
- `y` becomes -999 + 1 = -998.
- `K` and `N` remain unchanged, as their values are not directly affected by the loop over `y`.
- `times` would need to be recalculated based on the new value of `y`, so it becomes the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`.
- `ans` would also need to be updated based on the new `times` list, so it becomes the minimum between its previous minimum value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the new sorted `times` list.

State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, and `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list**
