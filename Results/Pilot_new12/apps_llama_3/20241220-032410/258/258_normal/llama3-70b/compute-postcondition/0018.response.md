The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. This operation does not affect the values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, or `ans`. The value of `times` is a sorted version of its original value, which was `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`. Since `ans` is the minimum of `times[K - 1]` over all `y` from -1000 to 1000, and the list `times` has been sorted, the value of `ans` is now the minimum of the first `K` elements of the sorted list `times`, which is `times[0]` because `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` equals sorted `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`, `ans` is `times[0]`**
