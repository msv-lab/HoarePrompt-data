The given code snippet sorts the `times` list in ascending order. The initial state provides the values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and the relationship between `ans` and `times[K - 1]`. 

Since `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, its initial values are determined by this function call. However, without the definition of `func_2`, we can't determine the exact initial values of `times`. After sorting, the elements of `times` will be in ascending order.

The states of the other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by the `sort()` method called on the `times` list. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, and `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and `times[K - 1]`, where `times[K - 1]` now refers to the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, and `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum value and the (K-1)th smallest element in the sorted `times` list.**
