To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `ans` is positive infinity
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`

The code snippet is:
```python
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

This line of code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `times` at the index `K - 1`. 

Given that `ans` is initially positive infinity, the new value of `ans` will be `times[K - 1]` because `times[K - 1]` will always be less than or equal to positive infinity. The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `times` are not changed by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `ans` is `times[K - 1]`
- `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `ans` is `times[K - 1]`, `times` is the sorted return value of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`**
