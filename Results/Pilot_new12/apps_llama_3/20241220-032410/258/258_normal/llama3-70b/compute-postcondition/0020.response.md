According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1. 

So, `y` is -1000 + 1 = -999. The other variables `x`, `K`, `N`, `times`, and `ans` do not depend on the loop condition. 

State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` equals sorted `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`, and `ans` is `times[0]`**
