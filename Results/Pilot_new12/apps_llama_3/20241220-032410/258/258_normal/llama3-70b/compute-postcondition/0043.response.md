To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for x in range(-1000, 1001):
    for y in range(-1000, 1001):
        times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
        times.sort()
        ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```
From the output states after a few iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

* `x` takes on values from `-1000` to `1000` in increments of `1`.
* `y` takes on values from `-1000` to `1000` in increments of `1` for each value of `x`.
* `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)` for the current `x` and `y`.
* `ans` is updated with the minimum of its current value and the `(K-1)`th smallest element in the sorted `times` list.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can deduce the following:

* `x` will have taken on all values from `-1000` to `1000`, and its final value will be `1000`.
* `y` will have taken on all values from `-1000` to `1000` for each value of `x`, and its final value will be `1000`.
* `times` will no longer be relevant, as its value is updated in each iteration and not stored.
* `ans` will be the minimum of the `(K-1)`th smallest element in the sorted `times` lists across all iterations of `x` and `y`.

Since `K` is a non-negative integer such that `1 <= K <= N`, where `N` is the total number of pieces of meat, and `ans` is initially positive infinity, the final value of `ans` will be the minimum of the `(K-1)`th smallest element in the sorted `times` lists across all possible `x` and `y` values.

Output State: **`x` is 1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, and `ans` is the minimum of the `(K-1)`th smallest element in the sorted `times` lists across all `x` and `y` values from -1000 to 1000.**
