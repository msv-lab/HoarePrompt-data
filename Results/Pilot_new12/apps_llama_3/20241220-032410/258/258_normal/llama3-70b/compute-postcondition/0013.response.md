To calculate the output state, we first analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state gives us specific values and conditions for variables `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, `times`, and `ans`. The code snippet provided is `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])`.

Given:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -998
- `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` is a non-negative integer
- `times` is the sorted list of return values from `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`
- `ans` remains as defined, with `times` now sorted in ascending order

The code affects the variable `ans` by updating its value to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `times` at index `K - 1`. Since `K` is at least 1 and at most `N`, and assuming `times` has at least `K` elements (since `K` <= `N` and `times` is sorted), `times[K - 1]` is a valid operation.

The new value of `ans` will be the smaller of its current value and the `K-1`th element of `times`. Without knowing the exact values returned by `func_2` or the initial value of `ans`, we can say that `ans` will be updated to this minimum value.

Therefore, the output state, considering all provided information and the effect of the code, is:
- `x` remains -1000
- `y` remains -998
- `K` remains a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `N` remains a non-negative integer
- `times` remains the sorted list of return values from `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`
- `ans` is now the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `N` is a non-negative integer, `times` is the sorted list of return values from `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`**
