The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`, where `N` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N` (inclusive), and `meats` is a list of tuples containing three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat. The function performs a binary search to converge on a precise solution, returning the converged value of `high`, which is essentially equal to `low`, with the difference between `high` and `low` being less than or equal to `1e-07`. The function assumes the existence of a helper function `func_1`, which is used within the binary search to determine the direction of the convergence. The input parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution, and the returned value represents a point of convergence based on the input parameters and the helper function `func_1`.
