You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_3()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat, K is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats), and T is a positive real number representing the time.
def func_1(meats, K, T):
    N = len(meats)
    for i in range(N):
        for j in range(i + 1, N):

            x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]

                x1, y1, c1, x2, y2, c2 = x2, y2, c2, x1, y1, c1

            if count >= K:
                return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` is a list of tuples potentially rearranged based on hardness and time conditions, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` equals the length of `meats`, and the function returns either `True` if a specific distance condition involving `K` number of meats is met or `None` otherwise.
    return False
    #The program returns False

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat.
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `high` and `low` have converged to a single value, `high` equals `low`, and the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to `1e-07`, `N` remains a positive integer, `K` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= K <= N`, `meats` remains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat
    return high
    #The program returns the converged value of `high`, which is essentially equal to `low`, representing a precise solution or point of convergence, with the difference between `high` and `low` being less than or equal to `1e-07`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of N tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples where each tuple contains three integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `3*N + 2` elements if `N` is positive, `index` is `2 + 3*N`, and if the loop executes, `x`, `y`, and `c` hold the last set of values read from `data`; if the loop does not execute, `meats` is empty, and `index` is 2.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
