You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` is a list of tuples potentially rearranged based on hardness and time conditions, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` equals the length of `meats`, and the function returns either `True` if a specific distance condition involving `K` number of meats is met or `None` otherwise.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples representing meat coordinates and properties, a non-negative integer K, and a positive real number T, and returns a boolean value. The function returns True if there exists a point such that the sum of the distances from this point to at least K meats, weighted by their hardness, is less than or equal to T. If no such point is found after checking all possible pairs of meats, the function returns False. The input list of meats may be rearranged during the function's execution based on the hardness and time conditions. The function handles cases where the weighted distance condition is met for at least K meats, but also considers scenarios where no such condition is fulfilled, resulting in a return value of False. Overall, the function assesses the geometric relationship between a set of points (meats) with associated weights (hardness) and a given time threshold, indicating whether a specific spatial condition involving a minimum number of points is satisfied.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat.

    low, high = 0, 1000000000.0
    while high - low > 1e-07:
        mid = (low + high) / 2
        
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `high` and `low` have converged to a single value, `high` equals `low`, and the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to `1e-07`, `N` remains a positive integer, `K` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= K <= N`, `meats` remains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat
    return high
    #The program returns the converged value of `high`, which is essentially equal to `low`, representing a precise solution or point of convergence, with the difference between `high` and `low` being less than or equal to `1e-07`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`, where `N` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N` (inclusive), and `meats` is a list of tuples containing three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat. The function performs a binary search to converge on a precise solution, returning the converged value of `high`, which is essentially equal to `low`, with the difference between `high` and `low` being less than or equal to `1e-07`. The function assumes the existence of a helper function `func_1`, which is used within the binary search to determine the direction of the convergence. The input parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution, and the returned value represents a point of convergence based on the input parameters and the helper function `func_1`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of N tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat.
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        
        index += 3
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `N` is an integer, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples where each tuple contains three integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `3*N + 2` elements if `N` is positive, `index` is `2 + 3*N`, and if the loop executes, `x`, `y`, and `c` hold the last set of values read from `data`; if the loop does not execute, `meats` is empty, and `index` is 2.
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input data from the user, parses it into integers, and uses it to calculate and print a result based on the provided parameters. It accepts no parameters directly but reads input in the format of two integers (N and K) followed by 3N integers representing x, y coordinates, and hardness of N pieces of meat. The function returns no value but prints a single floating-point number to the console, which is the result of calling another function `func_2` with the parsed input parameters. After execution, the program's state includes the input data processed into integers and a list of tuples representing the meat pieces, but the most significant outcome is the printed result. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer or out-of-range input values, and it assumes that the input will always be in the correct format. The final state of the program includes any side effects from the `func_2` function call and the printed result, but the local variables and data structures created during execution are discarded.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
