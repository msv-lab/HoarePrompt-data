Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The issue with this code is that the input is not being read correctly in the `func_3()` function. The code assumes that all the input is given in a single line, which is not the case according to the problem description. The problem description states that the input is given in the following format:

```
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
x_2 y_2 c_2
...
x_N y_N c_N
```

However, the code tries to read all the input in a single line, which will result in an `IndexError` because the list `data` will not have enough elements to access `data[index]`, `data[index + 1]`, and `data[index + 2]`.

To fix this, the code should read the input line by line. Here's a corrected version of the `func_3()` function:

```python
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    for _ in range(N):
        data = input().split()
        x = int(data[0])
        y = int(data[1])
        c = int(data[2])
        meats.append((x, y, c))
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
```

This version of the function reads the input line by line, which should fix the issue with the original code. However, without further testing, it's difficult to say for sure whether the rest of the code is correct. But the original code definitely has an issue with reading the input.
