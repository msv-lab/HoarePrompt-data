You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Takahashi wants to grill N pieces of meat on a grilling net, which can be seen as a two-dimensional plane. The coordinates of the i-th piece of meat are \left(x_i, y_i\right), and its hardness is c_i.
Takahashi can use one heat source to grill the meat. If he puts the heat source at coordinates \left(X, Y\right), where X and Y are real numbers, the i-th piece of meat will be ready to eat in c_i \times \sqrt{\left(X - x_i\right)^2 + \left(Y-y_i\right)^2} seconds.
Takahashi wants to eat K pieces of meat. Find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready if he put the heat source to minimize this time.

-----Constraints-----
 - All values in input are integers.
 - 1 \leq N \leq 60
 - 1 \leq K \leq N
 - -1000 \leq x_i , y_i \leq 1000
 - \left(x_i, y_i\right) \neq \left(x_j, y_j\right) \left(i \neq j \right)
 - 1 \leq c_i \leq 100

-----Input-----
Input is given from Standard Input in the following format:
N K
x_1 y_1 c_1
\vdots
x_N y_N c_N

-----Output-----
Print the answer.
It will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error from our answer is at most 10^{-6}.

-----Sample Input-----
4 3
-1 0 3
0 0 3
1 0 2
1 1 40

-----Sample Output-----
2.4

If we put the heat source at \left(-0.2, 0\right), the 1-st, 2-nd, and 3-rd pieces of meat will be ready to eat within 2.4 seconds. This is the optimal place to put the heat source.

''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a list of tuples representing meat coordinates and properties, a non-negative integer K, and a positive real number T, and returns a boolean value. The function returns True if there exists a point such that the sum of the distances from this point to at least K meats, weighted by their hardness, is less than or equal to T. If no such point is found after checking all possible pairs of meats, the function returns False. The input list of meats may be rearranged during the function's execution based on the hardness and time conditions. The function handles cases where the weighted distance condition is met for at least K meats, but also considers scenarios where no such condition is fulfilled, resulting in a return value of False. Overall, the function assesses the geometric relationship between a set of points (meats) with associated weights (hardness) and a given time threshold, indicating whether a specific spatial condition involving a minimum number of points is satisfied.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(N, K, meats):
    (low, high) = (0, 1000000000.0)

        mid = (low + high) / 2
        if func_1(meats, K, mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
    return high
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`, where `N` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N` (inclusive), and `meats` is a list of tuples containing three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat. The function performs a binary search to converge on a precise solution, returning the converged value of `high`, which is essentially equal to `low`, with the difference between `high` and `low` being less than or equal to `1e-07`. The function assumes the existence of a helper function `func_1`, which is used within the binary search to determine the direction of the convergence. The input parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution, and the returned value represents a point of convergence based on the input parameters and the helper function `func_1`.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_3():
    data = input().split()
    N = int(data[0])
    K = int(data[1])
    meats = []
    index = 2
    for _ in range(N):
        x = int(data[index])
        y = int(data[index + 1])
        c = int(data[index + 2])
        meats.append((x, y, c))
        index += 3
    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function reads input data from the user, parses it into integers, and uses it to calculate and print a result based on the provided parameters. It accepts no parameters directly but reads input in the format of two integers (N and K) followed by 3N integers representing x, y coordinates, and hardness of N pieces of meat. The function returns no value but prints a single floating-point number to the console, which is the result of calling another function `func_2` with the parsed input parameters. After execution, the program's state includes the input data processed into integers and a list of tuples representing the meat pieces, but the most significant outcome is the printed result. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer or out-of-range input values, and it assumes that the input will always be in the correct format. The final state of the program includes any side effects from the `func_2` function call and the printed result, but the local variables and data structures created during execution are discarded.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
