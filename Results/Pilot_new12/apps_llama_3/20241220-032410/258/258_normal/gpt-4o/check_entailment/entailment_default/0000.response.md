Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to correctly implement the described problem. The `func_1` function checks if there exists a point such that the sum of the distances from this point to at least `K` meats, weighted by their hardness, is less than or equal to a given time `T`. The `func_2` function performs a binary search to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready.

The code uses a binary search approach to converge on the minimum time required, which is a suitable method for this problem. The `func_1` function checks all possible pairs of meats to find a suitable point, and the `func_2` function uses this to find the minimum time.

The output hints provided for each function agree with the code and do not indicate any incorrect behavior. The `func_3` function reads input data, parses it, and calls `func_2` to calculate and print the result.

The problem description provides constraints and examples, and the code seems to handle these correctly. The binary search approach ensures that the code converges on the minimum time required, and the `func_1` function checks all possible pairs of meats to find a suitable point.

Given the provided information, the code appears to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
