Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to find the time required to have K or more pieces of meat ready by iterating over possible pairs of meats and checking if there exists a point such that the sum of the distances from this point to at least K meats, weighted by their hardness, is less than or equal to a given time T. However, the solution has several issues.

Firstly, the func_1 function checks all possible pairs of meats, which is not sufficient to find the optimal point. It may miss points that are not on the perpendicular bisector of any pair of meats, but still satisfy the condition for K meats.

Secondly, the function does not handle cases where the optimal point is one of the meat coordinates. In such cases, the function should check if the point is within the acceptable distance for at least K meats.

Lastly, the binary search in func_2 may not converge to the optimal solution in all cases, especially if the initial range is not properly chosen.

The provided sample input and output do not cover these edge cases, and the program may not produce the correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case. 

For instance, consider a case with three meats at (0,0), (0,1), and (0,2) with hardness 1, 1, and 2 respectively, and K = 2. The optimal point would be at (0,1) with a time of 1, but the program may not find this solution due to its limitations.
