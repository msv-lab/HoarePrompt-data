Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's an explanation of why it's correct:

1. **Input reading**: The program reads the input from the standard input in the format specified in the problem description, i.e., `N K` followed by `N` lines of `x_i y_i c_i`.
2. **Functionality**: The program implements the required functionality to find the time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready if the heat source is placed to minimize this time. It uses a binary search approach to find the minimum time.
3. **Precision**: The program returns the result with a precision of 6 decimal places, which is sufficient to meet the problem's requirement of an absolute or relative error of at most `10^-6`.

Here's a brief explanation of how the program works:

* `func_3`: Reads the input and calls `func_2` to find the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready.
* `func_2`: Performs a binary search to find the minimum time required. It calls `func_1` to check if a given time `T` is sufficient to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready.
* `func_1`: Checks if a given time `T` is sufficient to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. It iterates over all pairs of meat pieces and checks if the distance between them is less than or equal to the time `T`. If it finds a pair that satisfies this condition, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program's algorithm is correct because it systematically searches for the minimum time required to have `K` or more pieces of meat ready. The binary search approach ensures that the program finds the optimal solution, and the precision of the result is sufficient to meet the problem's requirements.

In summary, the program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality, reads the input correctly, and returns the result with sufficient precision.
