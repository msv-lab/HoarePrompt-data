Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks to find the minimum time required to grill at least K pieces of meat by placing a heat source at a specific point on a 2D plane. The code uses a binary search approach to converge on the minimum time.

The `func_1` function checks if there exists a point such that at least K pieces of meat are ready to eat within a given time T. It does this by iterating over all pairs of meats and calculating the point where the heat source should be placed to minimize the time. If such a point is found, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

The `func_2` function uses a binary search to find the minimum time required to grill at least K pieces of meat. It calls `func_1` with the current mid-point of the search range and updates the range accordingly.

The `func_3` function reads the input data, parses it into integers, and calls `func_2` with the parsed input parameters.

The provided code annotations seem to match the code and provide additional insight into the functionality of each function. The code handles the constraints specified in the problem description, such as the range of values for x, y, and c, and the fact that all input values are integers.

One potential case to consider is when the input values are at the boundaries of the specified ranges (e.g., x = -1000, y = 1000, c = 1 or c = 100). However, the code seems to handle these cases correctly.

Another case to consider is when the number of meats (N) is equal to 1. In this case, the code still works correctly, as it will simply return the time required to grill the single piece of meat.

The problem description also provides an example input and output, which can be used to test the code. The code seems to produce the correct output for this example.

Overall, based on the code and annotations provided, it appears that the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. Therefore, the correctness of the code is True.
