    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `meats` is a list of tuples potentially rearranged based on hardness and time conditions, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` equals the length of `meats`, and the function returns either `True` if a specific distance condition involving `K` number of meats is met or `None` otherwise.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of tuples representing meat coordinates and properties, a non-negative integer K, and a positive real number T, and returns a boolean value. The function returns True if there exists a point such that the sum of the distances from this point to at least K meats, weighted by their hardness, is less than or equal to T. If no such point is found after checking all possible pairs of meats, the function returns False. The input list of meats may be rearranged during the function's execution based on the hardness and time conditions. The function handles cases where the weighted distance condition is met for at least K meats, but also considers scenarios where no such condition is fulfilled, resulting in a return value of False. Overall, the function assesses the geometric relationship between a set of points (meats) with associated weights (hardness) and a given time threshold, indicating whether a specific spatial condition involving a minimum number of points is satisfied.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat.

            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `high` and `low` have converged to a single value, `high` equals `low`, and the difference between `high` and `low` is less than or equal to `1e-07`, `N` remains a positive integer, `K` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= K <= N`, `meats` remains a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat
    return high
    #The program returns the converged value of `high`, which is essentially equal to `low`, representing a precise solution or point of convergence, with the difference between `high` and `low` being less than or equal to `1e-07`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`, where `N` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer between 1 and `N` (inclusive), and `meats` is a list of tuples containing three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat. The function performs a binary search to converge on a precise solution, returning the converged value of `high`, which is essentially equal to `low`, with the difference between `high` and `low` being less than or equal to `1e-07`. The function assumes the existence of a helper function `func_1`, which is used within the binary search to determine the direction of the convergence. The input parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats` remain unchanged throughout the function's execution, and the returned value represents a point of convergence based on the input parameters and the helper function `func_1`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is a positive integer, K is a positive integer such that 1 <= K <= N, and meats is a list of N tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat.

    result = func_2(N, K, meats)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input data from the user, parses it into integers, and uses it to calculate and print a result based on the provided parameters. It accepts no parameters directly but reads input in the format of two integers (N and K) followed by 3N integers representing x, y coordinates, and hardness of N pieces of meat. The function returns no value but prints a single floating-point number to the console, which is the result of calling another function `func_2` with the parsed input parameters. After execution, the program's state includes the input data processed into integers and a list of tuples representing the meat pieces, but the most significant outcome is the printed result. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer or out-of-range input values, and it assumes that the input will always be in the correct format. The final state of the program includes any side effects from the `func_2` function call and the printed result, but the local variables and data structures created during execution are discarded.
