The code appends a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the `meats` list. The previous values of the variables are: `N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `index` is 5, `x` is equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`.

After executing the code, the `meats` list now contains two tuples: `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))` and `(x, y, c)` which is equivalent to `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))` and `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `index` is 5, `x` is equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`**
