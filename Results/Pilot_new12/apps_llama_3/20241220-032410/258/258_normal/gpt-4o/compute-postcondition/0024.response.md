The value of `result` is assigned the value returned by the function `func_2` with arguments `N`, `K`, and `meats`. The states of the other variables are not affected. `N` remains an integer, `K` remains `int(data[1])`, `meats` remains a list of `N` tuples where each tuple contains three integers, `data` remains a list of strings with at least `3*N + 2` elements if `N` is positive, and `index` remains `2 + 3*N`. If the loop executes, `x`, `y`, and `c` hold the last set of values read from `data`; if the loop does not execute, `meats` is empty, and `index` is 2. The value of `result` has been returned at the output state.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples where each tuple contains three integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `3*N + 2` elements if `N` is positive, `index` is `2 + 3*N`, `x`, `y`, and `c` hold the last set of values read from `data` if the loop executes, `meats` is empty and `index` is 2 if the loop does not execute, and `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`**
