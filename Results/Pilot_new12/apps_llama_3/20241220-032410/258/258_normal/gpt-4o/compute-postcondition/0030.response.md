The given code swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` with `x2`, `y2`, `c2`. Therefore, after executing the code, `x1` becomes equal to the original value of `x2`, `y1` becomes equal to the original value of `y2`, `c1` becomes equal to the original value of `c2`, `x2` becomes equal to the original value of `x1`, `y2` becomes equal to the original value of `y1`, and `c2` becomes equal to the original value of `c1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `x1` is the first element of the third tuple in `meats`, `y1` is the second element of the third tuple in `meats`, `c1` is the third element of the third tuple in `meats`, `x2` is the first element of the first tuple in `meats`, `y2` is the second element of the first tuple in `meats`, `c2` is the third element of the first tuple in `meats`.**
