The given code calculates the square of the distance between two points. To be specific, `d2` becomes `dx * dx + dy * dy`, where `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`. 

Considering `dx` and `dy` are defined as `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `(y1 - y2) / 2` respectively, we can substitute these values in `d2`. However, since the values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` are based on conditional assignments that depend on `c1 * T < c2 * T`, and the specific values of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2` are not given, we cannot simplify `d2` further without knowing the condition's outcome.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, and the conditional assignments for `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain as initially defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`.
