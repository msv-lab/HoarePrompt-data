Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are updated to the values of the 4th tuple in `meats`, and the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are updated to the values of the first tuple in `meats`, and `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my` are recalculated based on the new values. Otherwise, the values remain the same as in the precondition.**
