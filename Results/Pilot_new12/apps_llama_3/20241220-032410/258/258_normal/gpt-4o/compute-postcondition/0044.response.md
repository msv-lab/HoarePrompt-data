To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple.
   - `K` is a non-negative integer.
   - `T` is a positive real number.
   - `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list.
   - `i` is 0.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`.
   - `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined with `c1 < c2`.
   - `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
   - `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
   - `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
   - `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
   - `d2` is `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`.
   - `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`.
   - Two new variables `my` is introduced and calculated based on existing variables.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code calculates `my` using the formula `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
   - This introduces a new variable `my` with a value based on `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`.

3. **Output State**:
   - Since the calculation of `my` does not change the values of the existing variables (it only introduces a new one), all initial conditions remain valid.
   - The new variable `my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
   
Given the above analysis, the output state after executing the code is as follows:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined with `c1 < c2`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, and `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
