To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state includes various variables and their conditions, and the code snippet calculates a new variable `mx`. The calculation of `mx` depends on previously defined variables `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `meats` is a list of tuples,
- `K` is a non-negative integer,
- `T` is a positive real number,
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N` > `i + 1`,
- `i` is 2,
- `j` is 3,
- `meats[2]` and `meats[3]` have elements as per initial condition comparisons,
- `d` equals `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`,
- `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`,
- `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`,
- `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`,
- `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`,
- `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`,
- The condition `d` squared multiplied by `d2` is greater than `d2` for the loop to continue.

And the code snippet:
```python
mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

We update the state of `mx` based on the calculation. Since `d2` is not zero (because `d` squared multiplied by `d2` is greater than `d2` for the loop to continue, implying `d2` must have a value that allows this condition to be meaningful and not lead to division by zero), we can safely perform the division by `d2`.

Therefore, `mx` is assigned the value of `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. All other variables maintain their initial conditions and values as they are not modified by the code snippet.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N` > `i + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `meats[2]` and `meats[3]` have elements as per initial condition comparisons, `d` equals `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, and `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
