Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then the elements of the tuple `meats[2]` are `x2`, `y2`, `c2` and the elements of the tuple `meats[3]` are `x1`, `y1`, `c1`. Otherwise, the elements of the tuple `meats[2]` are `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and the elements of the tuple `meats[3]` are `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, and the current value of `c1` multiplied by `T` is greater than or equal to the current value of `c2` multiplied by `T`. `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are either determined by the last pair of tuples compared in a loop or are not defined.***
