To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial conditions.

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a non-negative integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 5`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 5
- `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- The behavior regarding `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` depends on the initial conditions and the values of `c1` and `c2`

And the code snippet:
```python
d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy
```

This code calculates the value of `d2` as the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. 

Since `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, we can express `d2` in terms of `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, and `y2`:
```python
d2 = ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)
```
Simplifying the expression:
```python
d2 = (x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4
```
Which can be further simplified to:
```python
d2 = ((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4
```

Given that the initial conditions of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are not explicitly defined but `d2` is now defined in terms of these variables, and considering that all other variables' states are not altered by the code snippet, the output state will include the new definition of `d2` along with the unchanged states of other variables.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 5`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`**
