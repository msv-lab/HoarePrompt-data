To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples.
- `K` is a non-negative integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.

The given code introduces a new variable `dx` and assigns it the value `(x1 - x2) / 2`.

The output state should include all information from the initial state that is still valid after executing the code, along with the updated or new information.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`**.
