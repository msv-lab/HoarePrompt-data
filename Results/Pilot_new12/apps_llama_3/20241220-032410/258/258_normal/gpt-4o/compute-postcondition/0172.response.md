Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 4`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `d` equals `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and the conditions for `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain as initially described. If `d` is less than 0, we move on to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, the execution proceeds without any changes to the variables.**
