Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, if `d` is less than 0, the loop moves to the next iteration, otherwise the execution continues with the current values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, and `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`.***
