The code appends a tuple `(x, y, c)` to the `meats` list, where `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `index` is 2, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`.**
