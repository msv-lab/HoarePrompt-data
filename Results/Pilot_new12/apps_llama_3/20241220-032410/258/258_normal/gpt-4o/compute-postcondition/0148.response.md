The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves on to the next iteration. Since there are no changes made to any variables within the `continue` statement itself, the values of all variables remain unchanged. The loop will proceed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N` > `i + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `meats[2]` and `meats[3]` have elements as per initial condition comparisons, `d` equals `c1 * T - c2 * T` and is less than 0, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are as previously defined or not defined, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
