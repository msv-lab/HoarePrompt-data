To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is a simple `for` loop that iterates `N` times. The loop variable is `_`, which is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't intend to use.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`.
- `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))` and `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`.
- `data` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `index` is 8.
- `x` is equal to `int(data[5])`.
- `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`.
- `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the loop counter needs to increment. Since the loop counter is not explicitly mentioned, we can assume it's managed internally by Python. Therefore, we need to focus on the conditions that allow the loop to continue.

The key condition here is that the loop must not have reached its `N` iterations. Since `N` is greater than 1, after the first iteration, `N` should still be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again. However, the actual value of `N` doesn't change; what changes is the number of iterations completed.

Given the states, we should consider what changes when the loop iterates again. The loop itself doesn't directly modify `N`, `K`, `meats`, `data`, `index`, `x`, `y`, or `c` based on the information provided. The increment or change in these variables would depend on the loop body, which is not shown.

However, considering the loop statement alone, for the loop to execute again, we implicitly know that the internal counter (not shown) must be less than `N`. Since `N` is greater than 1 and we've just completed one iteration, `N` must now be considered in the context of having one less iteration to go for the loop to continue.

State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1 (considering one less iteration), `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))` and `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `index` is 8, `x` is equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`**
