The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` was 5, so the new value of `index` is 8. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))` and `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `index` is 8, `x` is equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`**
