The code `d = c1 * T - c2 * T` updates the value of `d`. Previously, `d` was `(c2 * T - c1 * T) / (c1 * c2)` if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, or `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)` if `c1 * T >= c2 * T`. Now, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, which is the numerator of the previous expressions for `d`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is `meats[4][0]`, `y1` is `meats[4][1]`, `c1` is `meats[4][2]`, `x2` is `meats[1][0]`, `y2` is `meats[1][1]`, `c2` is `meats[1][2]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `(x2 + x1) / 2`, `cy` is `(y2 + y1) / 2`, `dx` is `(x2 - x1) / 2`, `dy` is `(y2 - y1) / 2`, `d2` is `((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of the number of elements in `meats` for which `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` is less than or equal to `K`; otherwise, `x1` is `meats[1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[1][2]`, `x2` is `meats[4][0]`, `y2` is `meats[4][1]`, `c2` is `meats[4][2]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of the number of elements in `meats` for which `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` is less than or equal to `K`**
