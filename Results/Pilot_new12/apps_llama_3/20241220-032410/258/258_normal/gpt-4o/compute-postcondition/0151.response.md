To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is: 
```python
cx = (x1 + x2) / 2
```

However, the initial state does not provide values for `x1` and `x2`. 

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a non-negative integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N` > `i + 1`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 3
- `meats[2]` and `meats[3]` have elements as per initial condition comparisons
- `d` equals `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`
- `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are as previously defined or not defined

Since `x1` and `x2` are not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine a specific value for `cx`. However, we can express `cx` as `(x1 + x2) / 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by the given code snippet. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a non-negative integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N` > `i + 1`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 3
- `meats[2]` and `meats[3]` have elements as per initial condition comparisons
- `d` equals `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`
- `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are as previously defined or not defined

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N` > `i + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `meats[2]` and `meats[3]` have elements as per initial condition comparisons, `d` equals `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are as previously defined or not defined**
