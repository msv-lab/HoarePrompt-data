The given code defines a new variable `dy` and assigns it the value `(y1 - y2) / 2`. 

The other variables are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2**
