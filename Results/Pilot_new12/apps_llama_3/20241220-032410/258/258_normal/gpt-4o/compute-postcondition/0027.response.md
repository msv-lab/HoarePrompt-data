Functionality: **The function reads input data from the user, parses it into integers, and uses it to calculate and print a result based on the provided parameters. It accepts no parameters directly but reads input in the format of two integers (N and K) followed by 3N integers representing x, y coordinates, and hardness of N pieces of meat. The function returns no value but prints a single floating-point number to the console, which is the result of calling another function `func_2` with the parsed input parameters. After execution, the program's state includes the input data processed into integers and a list of tuples representing the meat pieces, but the most significant outcome is the printed result. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer or out-of-range input values, and it assumes that the input will always be in the correct format. The final state of the program includes any side effects from the `func_2` function call and the printed result, but the local variables and data structures created during execution are discarded.**
