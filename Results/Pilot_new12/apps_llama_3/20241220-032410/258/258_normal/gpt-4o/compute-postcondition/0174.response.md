The code `cx = (x1 + x2) / 2` assigns the value of the average of `x1` and `x2` to `cx`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 4`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and the conditions for `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain as initially described.
