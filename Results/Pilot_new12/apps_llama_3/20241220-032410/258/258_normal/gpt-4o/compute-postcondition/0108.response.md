To determine the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables and their relationships as described in the initial state.

Given the code:
```python
dy = (y1 - y2) / 2
```

This line of code calculates the difference between `y1` and `y2`, divides it by 2, and assigns the result to `dy`.

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `K` is a non-negative integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`.
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`.

The introduction of `dy` as `(y1 - y2) / 2` affects the state by adding a new variable `dy` which represents half the difference between `y1` and `y2`.

The other variables' states remain unchanged as the code snippet only introduces a calculation for `dy` without modifying any other existing variables or their relationships.

Thus, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new variable `dy` which is equal to `(y1 - y2) / 2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`.**
