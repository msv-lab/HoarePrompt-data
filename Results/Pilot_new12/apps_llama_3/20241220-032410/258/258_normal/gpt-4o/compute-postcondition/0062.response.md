The code snippet provided is `continue`. This statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not change the values of any variables but moves the control to the next iteration of the loop if there is one.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
