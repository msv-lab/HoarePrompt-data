To determine the output state after running the given Python code, we need to analyze the provided initial state and the code itself. The initial state provides a list of variables with their respective values or characteristics, and the code introduces a new variable `my` based on calculations involving existing variables.

Given initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a non-negative integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 4`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 4
- `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`
- `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` equals `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`
- `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`

Code to execute:
```python
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

The code calculates a new variable `my` based on existing variables. The calculation for `my` is as follows:
- It starts with `cy`, which is the average of `y1` and `y2`.
- Then it subtracts the product of `dx` (half the difference between `x1` and `x2`) and the square root of the expression `d2 * d - d * d`, all divided by `d2`.

The expression `d2 * d - d * d` simplifies to `d2 * d - d^2`, which can be factored as `d * (d2 - d)`. Thus, the calculation for `my` can be simplified to:
```python
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2
```

This simplification shows that the square root term is similar to the one used in the calculation for `mx`, but with `dx` instead of `dy` and subtracted from `cy` instead of added to `cx`.

The output state, considering the new variable `my` and the unchanged initial state variables, is:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 4`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, and `my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2**
