Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is the first element of the third tuple in `meats`, `y1` is the second element of the third tuple in `meats`, `c1` is the third element of the third tuple in `meats`, `x2` is the first element of the first tuple in `meats`, `y2` is the second element of the first tuple in `meats`, `c2` is the third element of the first tuple in `meats`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as in the precondition: `x1` is the first element of the first tuple in `meats`, `y1` is the second element of the first tuple in `meats`, `c1` is the third element of the first tuple in `meats`, `x2` is the first element of the third tuple in `meats`, `y2` is the second element of the third tuple in `meats`, `c2` is the third element of the third tuple in `meats`.***
