To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.

The given code is:
```python
mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

From the initial state, we know that:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a non-negative integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`
- If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, the execution of the if-else block ends.

Now, let's analyze the given code:
- `mx` is assigned the value of `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`
- We can simplify `d2 * d - d * d` to `d2 * d - d^2` which equals `d * (d2 - d)`
- So, `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`

Therefore, the output state is:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a non-negative integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`
- `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`
- If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, the execution of the if-else block ends.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, and if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, the execution of the if-else block ends.**
