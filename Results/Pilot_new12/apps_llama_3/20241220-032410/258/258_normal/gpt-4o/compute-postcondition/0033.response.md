To understand the impact of the `continue` statement on the program, let's analyze what `continue` does. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. However, since there's no loop provided in the given snippet, we'll assume it's part of a loop structure that's not shown. Given the initial state and the nature of `continue`, none of the variables' values are altered by the `continue` statement itself. 

The initial state specifies that:
- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple.
- `K` is a non-negative integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are determined by the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`.

Since `continue` does not change any variable values but rather skips to the next iteration of the loop it's part of, we only note that the execution moves to the next iteration without altering any of the given variables.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are determined by the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
