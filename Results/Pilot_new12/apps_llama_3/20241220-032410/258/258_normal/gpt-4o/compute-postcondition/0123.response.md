The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there is no loop mentioned in the initial state or the code snippet, it is assumed that this `continue` statement is part of a larger loop that is not shown here. 

However, based on the provided information, the `continue` statement does not modify any variables. It only affects the flow of the program by skipping to the next iteration of the enclosing loop.

Therefore, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, if `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1` is `meats[4][0]`, `y1` is `meats[4][1]`, `c1` is `meats[4][2]`, `x2` is `meats[1][0]`, `y2` is `meats[1][1]`, `c2` is `meats[1][2]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `(x2 + x1) / 2`, `cy` is `(y2 + y1) / 2`, `dx` is `(x2 - x1) / 2`, `dy` is `(y2 - y1) / 2`, `d2` is `((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of the number of elements in `meats` for which `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` is less than or equal to `K`; otherwise, `x1` is `meats[1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[1][2]`, `x2` is `meats[4][0]`, `y2` is `meats[4][1]`, `c2` is `meats[4][2]`, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of the number of elements in `meats` for which `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` is less than or equal to `K`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop**
