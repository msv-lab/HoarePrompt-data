The given code reads a line of input and splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter. 

The variable `data` is assigned the value of the split input. 

The initial state variables `N`, `K`, and `meats` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat, and `data` is a list of strings from the input**
