To calculate the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program.

The code `meats.append((x, y, c))` adds a new tuple to the `meats` list. The tuple contains the values of `x`, `y`, and `c`, which are equal to `int(data[8])`, `int(data[9])`, and `int(data[10])` respectively.

Considering the initial state:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`.
- `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))` and `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`.
- `data` is a list of strings with at least 11 elements.
- `index` is 8.
- `x` is equal to `int(data[8])`.
- `y` is equal to `int(data[9])`.
- `c` is equal to `int(data[10])`.

After executing the code, the `meats` list will contain an additional tuple `(x, y, c)`. The other variables remain unchanged.

The updated `meats` list will be:
`meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`, `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, and `(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`.
- `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`, `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, and `(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))`.
- `data` is a list of strings with at least 11 elements.
- `index` is 8.
- `x` is equal to `int(data[8])`.
- `y` is equal to `int(data[9])`.
- `c` is equal to `int(data[10])`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`, `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, and `(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 11 elements, `index` is 8, `x` is equal to `int(data[8])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[9])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[10])`**
