The code provided simply prints the value of `result` to six decimal places. It does not change the values of any variables, so the states of all variables remain the same.

Output State: **`N` is an integer, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples where each tuple contains three integers, `data` is a list of strings with at least `3*N + 2` elements if `N` is positive, `index` is `2 + 3*N`, `x`, `y`, and `c` hold the last set of values read from `data` if the loop executes, `meats` is empty and `index` is 2 if the loop does not execute, `result` is the return value of `func_2(N, K, meats)`, and the value of `result` has been printed to six decimal places.**
