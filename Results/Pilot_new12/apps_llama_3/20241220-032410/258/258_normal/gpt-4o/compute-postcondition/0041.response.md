The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not terminate the loop, but rather moves on to the next iteration. 

In the given code, since there is no loop shown, it's assumed that this `continue` statement is part of a loop (likely a for or while loop) that iterates over the `meats` list or another condition.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined by the condition that led to the current iteration with `c1 < c2`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
