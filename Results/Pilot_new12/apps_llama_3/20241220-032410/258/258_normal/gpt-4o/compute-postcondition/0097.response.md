To determine the output state after running the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program. The code provided is:

```python
x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]
```

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `K` is a non-negative integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of either the third or another tuple in `meats` based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`.
- `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the other tuple.
- `d` is `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`.
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`.
- `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` if `d` squared is greater than `d2`.
- `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
- `count` is the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` for all relevant `x`, `y`, and `c`, and the count is less than `K`.

The provided code snippet directly assigns values to `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` from the tuple at index `i` in the `meats` list. Given that `i` is 1, it means the second tuple in the `meats` list is being referenced (since Python uses 0-based indexing).

The impact of this code on the program is the assignment of new values to `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` based on the elements of the tuple at index 1 in the `meats` list. The values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` do not change directly from this operation, but the change in `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` could potentially affect `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` if they are recalculated based on the new values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`.

However, since `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` depend on further calculations and comparisons not provided in the given code snippet, we cannot determine their exact new values without additional context or operations.

Therefore, the output state after running the given Python code snippet is:
- `meats` remains a list of tuples.
- `K` is a non-negative integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 1 in `meats`.
- The values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain as previously defined unless recalculated, in which case their values could change based on the new `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 1 in `meats`, and the count is less than `K`.**
