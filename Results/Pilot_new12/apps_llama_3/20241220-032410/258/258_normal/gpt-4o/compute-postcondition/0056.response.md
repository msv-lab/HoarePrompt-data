The value of `d` is updated by dividing it by `c1 * c2`. The initial value of `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`. After the division, `d` becomes `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `meats` is still a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is still a non-negative integer, `T` is still a positive real number, `N` is still greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is still 0, and `j` is still 3.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`**
