Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N` > `i + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `meats[2]` and `meats[3]` have elements as per initial condition comparisons, `d` equals `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are as previously defined or not defined. If `d` is less than 0, we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the execution continues.***
