To calculate the output state, we should analyze how the given code affects the variables and their relations as described in the initial state.

Given the code:
```python
x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]
```
And the initial state where:
- `meats` is a list of tuples,
- `K` is a non-negative integer,
- `T` is a positive real number,
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 5`,
- `i` is 2,
- `j` is 5,
- `x1` equals `a`,
- `y1` equals `b`,
- `c1` equals `c`,
- `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`,
- `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`,
- `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`,
- `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`,
- `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`,
- `d2` equals `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`,
- `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`,
- `my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`,

The code extracts the values from the `meats` list at index `j` (which is 5) and assigns them to `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`, respectively. 

Since `meats` is a list of tuples and `j` equals 5, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` will be the components of the tuple at index 5 in the `meats` list.

The values of `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` are not directly affected by this operation. However, `d` is affected because it equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, and now `c2` has a value.

Therefore, after this operation, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` will have values extracted from `meats[j]`. The rest of the variables either retain their previous values or their definitions based on other variables.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 5`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `x1` equals `a`, `y1` equals `b`, `c1` equals `c`, `x2` equals the first element of `meats[j]`, `y2` equals the second element of `meats[j]`, `c2` equals the third element of `meats[j]`, `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`.**
