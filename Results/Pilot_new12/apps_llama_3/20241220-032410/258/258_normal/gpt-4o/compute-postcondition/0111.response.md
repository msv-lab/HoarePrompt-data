Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`. If `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, we continue to the next iteration of the loop; otherwise, the execution of the if-else block ends.***
