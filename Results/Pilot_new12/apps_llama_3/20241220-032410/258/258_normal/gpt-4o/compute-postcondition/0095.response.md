Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of either the second or third tuple in `meats` based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the other tuple, `d` is `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` if `d` squared is greater than `d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` for all relevant `x`, `y`, and `c`, and the count is less than `K`**
