The code updates the value of `dy`. The new value of `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N` > `i + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `meats[2]` and `meats[3]` have elements as per initial condition comparisons, `d` equals `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are as previously defined or not defined.**
