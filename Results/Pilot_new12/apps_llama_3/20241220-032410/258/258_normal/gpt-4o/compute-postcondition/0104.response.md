To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and how the given code affects it.

The initial state is as follows:
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `K` is a non-negative integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.

Additionally, based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are determined from either the tuple at index 3 or index 1 in `meats`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` come from `meats[3]` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` come from `meats[1]`. Otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` come from `meats[1]` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` come from `meats[3]`.

Given that `d = c1 * T - c2 * T` and if `d` is less than 0, we move to the next iteration of the loop, but since we're calculating the effect of `d /= c1 * c2`, we're considering the scenario where the execution continues (implying `d` is not less than 0).

Now, the given code is `d /= c1 * c2`. This operation updates the value of `d` by dividing it by the product of `c1` and `c2`.

So, the new value of `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.

Given this, the output state is:
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `K` is a non-negative integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 3 in `meats`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 1 in `meats`. Otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 1 in `meats`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 3 in `meats`.
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`**
