To calculate the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the program. The given code is:

```python
cy = (y1 + y2) / 2
```

The code calculates the average of `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `cy`.

The initial state is: 
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a non-negative integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`

The code only updates the value of `cy`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a non-negative integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`**
