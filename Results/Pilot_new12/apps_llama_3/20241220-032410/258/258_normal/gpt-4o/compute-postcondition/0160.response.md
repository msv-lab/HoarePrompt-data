To determine the output state after executing the provided Python code snippet, let's analyze its impact step by step:

1. **Code Analysis**: The given code snippet is `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. This line of code calculates a new variable `my` based on previously defined variables `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`.

2. **Previous Values**: 
   - `meats` is a list of tuples.
   - `K` is a non-negative integer.
   - `T` is a positive real number.
   - `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > i + 1`.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `j` is 3.
   - `meats[2]` and `meats[3]` have elements as per initial condition comparisons.
   - `d` equals `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`.
   - `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
   - `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
   - `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
   - `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
   - `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`.
   - `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
   
3. **Calculation Result**: 
   - The new variable `my` is calculated as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. This means `my` is dependent on the values of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`, which are already defined in the initial state.

4. **Output State**: 
   - All variables from the initial state retain their values and conditions since the code only introduces a new variable `my` without altering any existing ones.
   - `my` is now defined as `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

Considering the steps above, the output state after executing the code is:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > i + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `meats[2]` and `meats[3]` have elements as per initial condition comparisons, `d` equals `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.**
