Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns a boolean value True, otherwise, no value is returned**
