The given code assigns the values of the tuple at index `i` in the `meats` list to the variables `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. 

Since `i` is 1 and list indices in Python start at 0, `meats[i]` refers to the second tuple in the `meats` list. 

The values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are now the corresponding elements of the second tuple in `meats`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the second tuple in `meats` respectively, and the values of `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are determined by the last pair of tuples compared in the loop, or are not defined if the loop does not execute**
