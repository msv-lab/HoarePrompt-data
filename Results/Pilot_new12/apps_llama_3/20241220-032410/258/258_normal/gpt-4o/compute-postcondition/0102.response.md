The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are not provided with any loop in the code snippet, let's consider that this `continue` statement is inside a loop. 

Given that, when the `continue` statement is executed, it will skip the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. The values of the variables do not change.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and the count is less than `K`. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 3 in `meats`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 1 in `meats`. Otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 1 in `meats`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 3 in `meats`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
