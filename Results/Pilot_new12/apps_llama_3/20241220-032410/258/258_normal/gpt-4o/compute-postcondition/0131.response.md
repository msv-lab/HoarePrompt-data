The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of any variables. 

The values of the variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, and the conditional assignments for `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain as initially defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, and we continue with the next iteration of the loop.
