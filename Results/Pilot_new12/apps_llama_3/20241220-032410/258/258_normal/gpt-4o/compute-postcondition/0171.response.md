The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, we assume that this `continue` statement is part of a larger loop that is not shown. 

Given the initial state and the `continue` statement, no variables are directly modified by the `continue` statement itself. The values of all variables remain the same as they were before the `continue` statement was executed. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 4`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `d` equals `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and the conditions for `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain as initially described, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 4`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `d` equals `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and the conditions for `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain as initially described, and we move on to the next iteration of the loop.**
