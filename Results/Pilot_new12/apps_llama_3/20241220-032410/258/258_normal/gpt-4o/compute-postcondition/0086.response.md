The code `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy` updates the value of `d2` based on the previously calculated values of `dx` and `dy`. 

Since `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, 
`d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`.
This simplifies to `d2 = (x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`, which can be further simplified to `d2 = ((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`meats` is a list of tuples, 
`K` is a non-negative integer, 
`T` is a positive real number, 
`N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, 
`i` is 1, 
`j` is 2, 
`x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of either the second or third tuple in `meats` based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, 
`x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the other tuple, 
`d` is `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`, 
`cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
`cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, 
`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, 
`dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, 
`d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, 
and the values of `mx`, `my`, and `count` are as determined by the last comparison or not defined if no comparison occurred.
