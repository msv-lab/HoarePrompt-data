The given code calculates the value of `mx` based on the existing values of `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`. The new value of `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 5`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and if `d * d2` is less than or equal to `d2`, the execution ends, otherwise, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop.
