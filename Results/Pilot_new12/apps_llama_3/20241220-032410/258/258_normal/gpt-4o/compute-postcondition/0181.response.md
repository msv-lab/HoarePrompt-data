To calculate the new state after executing the code `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, let's analyze the given initial state and the code's impact on it.

Given:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a non-negative integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 4`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 4
- `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`
- `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` equals `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`
- If `d * d2 > d2`, the state remains unchanged, otherwise, there is no additional change as there is no else part.

However, the condition provided doesn't seem to directly influence the calculation of `mx` since `mx` is calculated regardless of the condition `d * d2 > d2`. Thus, the value of `mx` is directly derived from the given formula.

Since `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, let's simplify the expression under the square root:
- `d2 * d - d * d = d * (d2 - d)`

So, `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`.

The initial state's conditions regarding `d * d2 > d2` don't directly impact the calculation of `mx` as the code snippet provided calculates `mx` based on the given formula without conditional execution based on the state of `d` and `d2`.

Therefore, considering the initial state and the calculation:
- `meats` remains a list of tuples
- `K` remains a non-negative integer
- `T` remains a positive real number
- `N` remains the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 4`
- `i` remains 2
- `j` remains 4
- `d` remains `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`
- `cx` remains `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` remains `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` remains `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` remains `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` remains `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`
- `mx` is now `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 4`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, and `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`**
