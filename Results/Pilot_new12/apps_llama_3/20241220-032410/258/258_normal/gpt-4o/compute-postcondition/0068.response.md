Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `mx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns True, otherwise, no value is returned**
