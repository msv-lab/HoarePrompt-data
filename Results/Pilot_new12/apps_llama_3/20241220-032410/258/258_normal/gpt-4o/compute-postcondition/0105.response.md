To calculate the result, we need to consider the given initial state and the impact of the provided Python code snippet on the program.

Given Initial State:
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `K` is a non-negative integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`.
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
cx = (x1 + x2) / 2
```

This code assigns the variable `cx` the value of the average of `x1` and `x2`. 

The output state should include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Since `cx` is a new variable being introduced and `x1` and `x2` are part of the initial conditions based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, we update the state with the new variable `cx`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`**
