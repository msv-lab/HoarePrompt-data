Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` are determined by the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`. If `d` is less than 0, we continue to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the program continues with the current state***.
