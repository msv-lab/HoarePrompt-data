Postcondition: ***`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 5`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, if `d < 0`, then the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, and `my` are calculated based on whether `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T` or not, and we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the program continues with the current values of the variables.***
