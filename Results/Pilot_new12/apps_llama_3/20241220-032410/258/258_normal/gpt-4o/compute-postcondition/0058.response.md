The code calculates the average of `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to `cy`. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`**
