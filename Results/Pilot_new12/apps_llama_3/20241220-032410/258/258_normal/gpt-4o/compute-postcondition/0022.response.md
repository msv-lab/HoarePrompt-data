The code `index += 3` increments the value of `index` by 3. The initial state of `index` is 8. 

So, the new value of `index` is 8 + 3, which equals 11.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`, `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, and `(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 11 elements, `index` is 11, `x` is equal to `int(data[8])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[9])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[10])`.
Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`, `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, and `(int(data[8]), int(data[9]), int(data[10]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 11 elements, `index` is 11, `x` is equal to `int(data[8])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[9])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[10])`**
