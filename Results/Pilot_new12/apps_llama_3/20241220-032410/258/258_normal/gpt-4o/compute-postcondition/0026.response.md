The function `func_3` appears to be missing its parameters. Based on the provided parameter constraints, it should accept parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. 

The function `func_3` accepts parameters `N`, `K`, and `meats`. `N` is a positive integer, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `meats` is a list of `N` tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat. 

However, the output description is missing, which is necessary to fully describe the functionality. Since the output description is not provided, I will assume a general case for illustration purposes.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters N, K, and meats, where N is a positive integer, K is a positive integer between 1 and N, and meats is a list of N tuples containing x, y coordinates and hardness of meat pieces, and returns a value based on the provided input parameters and their relationships.**
