The given code changes the value of `c` to `int(data[index + 2])`. Since `index` is 8, `c` becomes `int(data[8 + 2])`, which is `int(data[10])`. 

The values of the other variables are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))` and `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 11 elements, `index` is 8, `x` is equal to `int(data[8])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[9])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[10])`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuples `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))` and `(int(data[5]), int(data[6]), int(data[7]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least 11 elements, `index` is 8, `x` is equal to `int(data[8])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[9])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[10])`**
