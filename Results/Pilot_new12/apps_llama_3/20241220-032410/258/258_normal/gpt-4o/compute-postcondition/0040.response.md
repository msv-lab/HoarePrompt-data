To calculate the output state, we consider the impact of the code on the program. The code `d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy` assigns a new value to `d2`, which is the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. 

Given that `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, the expression for `d2` becomes `d2 = ((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`.

Simplifying, `d2 = (x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`.

The other variables' states are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state includes all initial conditions plus the new value of `d2`. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined by the condition that led to the current iteration with `c1 < c2`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`.**
