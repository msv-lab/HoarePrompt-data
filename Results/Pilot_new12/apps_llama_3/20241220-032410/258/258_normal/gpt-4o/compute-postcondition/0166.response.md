The given code snippet is:
```
x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]
```
Given that `i` is 2, the code assigns the values of `meats[2]` to `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` respectively.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 4`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `x1` equals the first element of `meats[2]`, `y1` equals the second element of `meats[2]`, `c1` equals the third element of `meats[2]`, `d` equals `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and `count` equals the sum of the number of times `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)` is less than `K`, meaning `count` is less than `K`**
