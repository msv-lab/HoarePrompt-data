To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is an integer greater than 0
- `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`
- `meats` is an empty list
- `data` is a list of strings with at least one element
- `index` is 2

The code snippet is:
```python
x = int(data[index])
```

Given that `index` is 2, this means we are accessing the third element of the `data` list (since indexing starts at 0). Therefore, `x` will be assigned the integer value of the string at `data[2]`.

The output state is as follows:
- `N` is an integer greater than 0
- `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`
- `meats` is an empty list
- `data` is a list of strings with at least one element
- `index` is 2
- `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `index` is 2, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`**
