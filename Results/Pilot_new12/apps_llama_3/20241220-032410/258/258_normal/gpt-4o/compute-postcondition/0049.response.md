To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the program. 

The given code is:
```python
x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]
```

From the initial state, we know that `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, and `i` is 0. 

So, the code `x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]` assigns the values of the tuple at index `i` (which is 0) in the `meats` list to the variables `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` respectively.

Therefore, `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` are updated to the values of the first tuple in the `meats` list.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Thus, the Output State is: 
`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, 
`K` is a non-negative integer, 
`T` is a positive real number, 
`N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, 
`i` is 0, 
`j` is 3, 
`d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, 
`x1` is the first element of the first tuple in `meats`, 
`y1` is the second element of the first tuple in `meats`, 
`c1` is the third element of the first tuple in `meats`, 
`x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined with `c1 < c2`, 
`cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
`cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, 
`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, 
`dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, 
`d2` is `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`, 
`mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, 
`my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `x1` is the first element of the first tuple in `meats`, `y1` is the second element of the first tuple in `meats`, `c1` is the third element of the first tuple in `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined with `c1 < c2`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`**
