To solve this problem, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program and calculate the result step by step.


Given the formula `mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, we can simplify it as follows:
`mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * (d - d)) / d2`
This simplifies to:
`mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(0) / d2`
Which further simplifies to:
`mx = cx + dy * 0 / d2`
And finally simplifies to:
`mx = cx`


The value of `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`. Therefore, the value of `mx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.


The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, 
`K` is a non-negative integer, 
`T` is a positive real number, 
`N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, 
`i` is 0, 
`j` is 3, 
`d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, 
`cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
`cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, 
`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, 
`dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, 
`d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, 
`mx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
and if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the program ends the current iteration.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `mx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the program ends the current iteration.**
