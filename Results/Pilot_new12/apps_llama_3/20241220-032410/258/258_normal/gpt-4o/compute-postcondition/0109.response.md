To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the program. The code snippet provided is:

```python
d2 = dx * dx + dy * dy
```

This line of code calculates the square of the distance between two points (`x1`, `y1`) and (`x2`, `y2`) using the midpoint and half-distance formulas, where `dx` is the half-distance in the x-direction and `dy` is the half-distance in the y-direction.

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples,
- `K` is a non-negative integer,
- `T` is a positive real number,
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3,
- `i` is 1,
- `j` is 3,
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`,
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`,
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`,
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`,
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`,
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`.

The code introduces a new variable `d2` which is the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. This can be interpreted as the square of the distance between the two points (`x1`, `y1`) and (`x2`, `y2`), since `dx` and `dy` represent the differences in x and y coordinates, respectively, divided by 2.

Therefore, `d2 = ((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, which simplifies to `d2 = (x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`.

The output state, considering all given information and the update of variable `d2`, is:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`.**
