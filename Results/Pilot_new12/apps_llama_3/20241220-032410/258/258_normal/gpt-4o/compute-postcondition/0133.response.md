To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The initial state includes:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a non-negative integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 4
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 4
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`
- Conditional assignments for `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` based on `c1 * T < c2 * T`

Given the code:
```python
mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

The impact of this code is on the variable `mx`. It updates `mx` based on the values of `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`. The new value of `mx` is calculated as `cx + dy * sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

To be precise, the expression `d2 * d - d * d` simplifies to `d2 * d - d^2`, which can also be written as `d * (d2 - d)`. Thus, the calculation involves the square root of this product, scaled by `dy` and divided by `d2`, then added to `cx`.

The output state, considering the update of `mx` and including all other unchanged variables and conditions, is:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a non-negative integer
- `T` is a positive real number
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 4
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 4
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`
- Conditional assignments for `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `my`, and `count` remain as initially defined based on `c1 * T < c2 * T`
- `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, and the conditional assignments for `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `my`, and `count` remain as initially defined based on `c1 * T < c2 * T`.**
