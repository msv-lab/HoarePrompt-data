The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not terminate the loop, but instead, it transfers the control to the next iteration of the loop. Since the `continue` statement does not affect any variables, the state of the variables after the execution remains the same as before. 

The variables `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` retain their initial values. The loop will continue with the next iteration.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 5`, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `d` is `d / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop**
