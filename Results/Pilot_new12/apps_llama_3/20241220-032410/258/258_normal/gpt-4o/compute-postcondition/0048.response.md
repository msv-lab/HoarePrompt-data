According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `N`. If `j` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2, `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 3. Also, since `j` is now 3, `N` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined with `c1 < c2`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`**
