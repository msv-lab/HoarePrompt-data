The code swaps the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1` with `x2`, `y2`, `c2` and vice versa. 

So, `x1` is now equal to `x2` which is the first element of `meats[j]`, 
`y1` is now equal to `y2` which is the second element of `meats[j]`, 
`c1` is now equal to `c2` which is the third element of `meats[j]`, 
`x2` is now equal to `a`, 
`y2` is now equal to `b`, 
`c2` is now equal to `c`.

Other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`meats` is a list of tuples, 
`K` is a non-negative integer, 
`T` is a positive real number, 
`N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 5`, 
`i` is 2, 
`j` is 5, 
`x1` equals the first element of `meats[j]`, 
`y1` equals the second element of `meats[j]`, 
`c1` equals the third element of `meats[j]`, 
`x2` equals `a`, 
`y2` equals `b`, 
`c2` equals `c`, 
`d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)` which is `((third element of meats[j]) * T - c * T) / ((third element of meats[j]) * c)`, 
`cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2` which is `((first element of meats[j]) + a) / 2`, 
`cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2` which is `((second element of meats[j]) + b) / 2`, 
`dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2` which is `((first element of meats[j]) - a) / 2`, 
`dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2` which is `((second element of meats[j]) - b) / 2`, 
`d2` equals `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)` which is `(((first element of meats[j]) - a) / 2) * ((first element of meats[j]) - a) / 2) + (((second element of meats[j]) - b) / 2) * ((second element of meats[j]) - b) / 2)`, 
`mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, 
`my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`.
