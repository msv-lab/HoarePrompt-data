To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and the code's impact on it.

Initially, we have:
- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples.
- `K` is a non-negative integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 3.
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`.
- `mx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- The condition `if d * d2` is greater than `d2`, then the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the program ends the current iteration.

The given code snippet is:
```python
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

After executing this code, the only change in the state is the assignment of a value to `my`. Thus, `my` is now assigned the value `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.

All other variables retain their initial values or conditions. 

Given that `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, and `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, the new value of `my` can be expressed in terms of these variables.

The condition regarding the loop iteration depends on `d * d2` being greater than `d2`, which influences the program flow but does not change the variable values directly.

Therefore, the output state, considering the specific update and retaining all initial conditions that are still valid, is:

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `mx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and the loop condition remains dependent on `d * d2` being greater than `d2`.**
