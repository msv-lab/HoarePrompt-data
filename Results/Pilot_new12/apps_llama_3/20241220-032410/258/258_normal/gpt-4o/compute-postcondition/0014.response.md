The value of `c` is updated to be `int(data[index + 2])`. Given that `index` is 5, `c` becomes `int(data[5 + 2])`, which simplifies to `int(data[7])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `index` is 5, `x` is equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[7])`.**
