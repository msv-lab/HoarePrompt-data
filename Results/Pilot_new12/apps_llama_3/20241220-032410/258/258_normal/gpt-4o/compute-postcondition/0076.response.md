Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the second tuple in `meats` respectively, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the third tuple in `meats` respectively. Otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the third tuple in `meats` respectively, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the second tuple in `meats` respectively, and the values of `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are determined by the last pair of tuples compared in the loop, or are not defined if the loop does not execute.**
