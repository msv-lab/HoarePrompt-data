To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`.
- `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`.
- `data` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `index` is 5.
- `x` is equal to `int(data[5])`.
- `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`.
- `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
y = int(data[index + 1])
```

Given that `index` is 5, we calculate `index + 1` as 6. Therefore, the code updates `y` to be the integer value of `data[6]`.

The states of `N`, `K`, `meats`, `data`, `index`, `x`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. Only the value of `y` changes, and it becomes `int(data[6])`.

Thus, the output state, considering all the initial conditions and the change made by the code, is:
- `N` is an integer greater than 1.
- `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`.
- `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`.
- `data` is a list of strings with at least one element.
- `index` is 5.
- `x` is equal to `int(data[5])`.
- `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`.
- `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 1, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is a list containing the tuple `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `index` is 5, `x` is equal to `int(data[5])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[6])`, and `c` is equal to `int(data[4])`.**
