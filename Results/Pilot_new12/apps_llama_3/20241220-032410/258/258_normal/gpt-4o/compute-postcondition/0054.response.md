The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, we assume that this `continue` statement is inside a loop that iterates over the `meats` list or some other loop. However, without the loop details, we consider the general effect of `continue`, which is to move on to the next iteration of the loop if any.

Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, and considering that `continue` does not directly modify any variable but skips to the next iteration, the values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, and `d` remain unchanged as `continue` itself does not alter variable values directly. 

The value of `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, but since `c1` and `c2` are not defined in the initial state or the given code, we treat `d` as it is, without any change.

The initial state conditions regarding the types and relationships of the variables still hold, as the `continue` statement does not modify any of these conditions.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop if any.**
