The code calculates `cx` as the average of `x1` and `x2`. The initial state conditions for `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `d`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` do not change as a result of this operation, except for the introduction of `cx` which is now `(x1 + x2) / 2`. The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` still holds, implying `c1 < c2` since `T` is a positive real number.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined by the condition that led to the current iteration with `c1 < c2`, and `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.**
