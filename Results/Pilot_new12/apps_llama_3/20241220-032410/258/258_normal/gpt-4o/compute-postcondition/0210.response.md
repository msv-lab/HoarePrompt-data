The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `meats`, `K`, and `T`. `meats` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat. `K` is a non-negative integer such that 1 <= K <= len(meats). `T` is a positive real number representing the time. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value, either True or False, indicating whether a certain condition has been met based on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of meat coordinates and properties, a non-negative integer K, and a positive real number T, and returns a boolean value indicating whether a specific condition related to the input parameters has been fulfilled.**
