The code snippet assigns a value to the variable `y`. To calculate this value, we need to evaluate `int(data[index + 1])`. Given that `index` is 2, `index + 1` equals 3. Therefore, `y` is assigned the value of `int(data[3])`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than 0, `K` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `meats` is an empty list, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `index` is 2, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `y` is equal to `int(data[3])`**
