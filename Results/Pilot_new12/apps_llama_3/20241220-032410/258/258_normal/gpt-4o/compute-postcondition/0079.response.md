The `continue` statement means that the current iteration of the loop will be skipped and the execution will move to the next iteration. Since we are continuing, no new values are assigned to the variables, and the loop control is passed to the next iteration.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of either the second or third tuple in `meats` based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the other tuple, `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`, and the values of `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are as determined by the last comparison or not defined if no comparison occurred. The current value of `d` is less than 0, meaning `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
