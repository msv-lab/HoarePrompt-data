The values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are swapped. The states of the other variables are not directly affected. 
`x1` becomes `meats[4][0]`, 
`y1` becomes `meats[4][1]`, 
`c1` becomes `meats[4][2]`, 
`x2` becomes `meats[1][0]`, 
`y2` becomes `meats[1][1]`, 
`c2` becomes `meats[1][2]`. 

The values of `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, `count` are indirectly affected, 
`d` becomes `(c2 * T - c1 * T) / (c2 * c1)`, 
`cx` becomes `(x2 + x1) / 2`, 
`cy` becomes `(y2 + y1) / 2`, 
`dx` becomes `(x2 - x1) / 2`, 
`dy` becomes `(y2 - y1) / 2`, 
`d2` becomes `((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / 4`, 
`mx` becomes `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, 
`my` becomes `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, 
`count` is recalculated based on the new values of `mx`, `my`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `x1` is `meats[4][0]`, `y1` is `meats[4][1]`, `c1` is `meats[4][2]`, `x2` is `meats[1][0]`, `y2` is `meats[1][1]`, `c2` is `meats[1][2]`, `d` is `(c2 * T - c1 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x2 + x1) / 2`, `cy` is `(y2 + y1) / 2`, `dx` is `(x2 - x1) / 2`, `dy` is `(y2 - y1) / 2`, `d2` is `((x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of the number of elements in `meats` for which `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` is less than or equal to `K`**
