The code extracts the elements of the tuple at index `j` (which is 3) from the `meats` list and assigns them to `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. 

Given that `j` is 3, `x2`, `y2`, and `c2` will be the elements of the 4th tuple in the `meats` list (since indexing starts at 0).

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 3 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `x1` is the first element of the first tuple in `meats`, `y1` is the second element of the first tuple in `meats`, `c1` is the third element of the first tuple in `meats`, `x2` is the first element of the 4th tuple in `meats`, `y2` is the second element of the 4th tuple in `meats`, `c2` is the third element of the 4th tuple in `meats`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `(x1 - x2)^2 / 4 + (y1 - y2)^2 / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`**
