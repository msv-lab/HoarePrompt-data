The value of `cy` is calculated as the average of `y1` and `y2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The initial state had the following properties: 
- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, 
- `K` is a non-negative integer, 
- `T` is a positive real number, 
- `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, 
- `i` is 0, 
- `j` is 2, 
- `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, 
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined by the condition that led to the current iteration with `c1 < c2`, 
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
The value of `cy` is now `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, 
`K` is a non-negative integer, 
`T` is a positive real number, 
`N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, 
`i` is 0, 
`j` is 2, 
`d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, 
`x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined by the condition that led to the current iteration with `c1 < c2`, 
`cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
`cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined by the condition that led to the current iteration with `c1 < c2`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`**
