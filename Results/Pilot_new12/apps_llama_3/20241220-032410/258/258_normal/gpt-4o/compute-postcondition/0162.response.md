Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > i + 1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `meats[2]` and `meats[3]` have elements as per initial condition comparisons, `d` equals `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` equals `dx * dx + dy * dy`, `mx` equals `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` equals `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and the current value of `count` equals the sum of the number of times `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)` and `count` is greater than or equal to `K`.**
