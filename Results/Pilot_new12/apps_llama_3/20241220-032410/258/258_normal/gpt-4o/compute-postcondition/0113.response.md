To calculate the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state includes variables such as `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, and several variables derived from `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, and mathematical operations involving these.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```
This line calculates the value of `my` based on previously defined variables `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`.

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `K` is a non-negative integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 3.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`.
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`.
- `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`.
- The condition regarding `d * d2` being greater than `d2` and its implications on the loop iteration.

The given code calculates `my` as follows: `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`. This introduces a new variable `my` into the state, which is a function of `cy`, `dx`, `d2`, and `d`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and the condition regarding `d * d2` compared to `d2` remains relevant for loop iteration control.**
