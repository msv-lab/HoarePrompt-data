The initial value of `N` is updated to be the integer value of `data[0]`. The values of `K`, `meats`, and `data` are not changed by the code. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer value equal to `int(data[0])`, `K` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `int(data[0])`, `meats` is a list of `N` tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the x-coordinate, y-coordinate, and hardness of a piece of meat, and `data` is a list of strings from the input**
