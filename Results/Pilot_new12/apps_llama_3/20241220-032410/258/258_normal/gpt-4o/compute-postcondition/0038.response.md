The code snippet calculates `dx` as `(x1 - x2) / 2`. The `meats` list and most variables retain their initial state values, as the code only updates the value of `dx`. The new value of `dx` is assigned based on the values of `x1` and `x2`, which are determined by the condition that led to the current iteration. 

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is greater than 2 and equal to the number of elements in the `meats` list, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T / (c1 * c2)`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined by the condition that led to the current iteration with `c1 < c2`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`**
