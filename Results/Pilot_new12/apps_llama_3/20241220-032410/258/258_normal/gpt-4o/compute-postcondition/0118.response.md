To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet within the context of the provided initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
x1, y1, c1 = meats[i]
```

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `K` is a non-negative integer.
- `T` is a positive real number.
- `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 4.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 4.
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`.
- `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`.
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`.
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`.
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`.
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`.
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`.
- `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`.
- `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`.
- `count` is the sum of the number of elements in `meats` for which `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` is less than or equal to `K`.

This code snippet directly affects the values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`. Given that `i` is 1, it means we are accessing the second element of the `meats` list (since indexing starts at 0), and assigning its components to `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` respectively.

Therefore, the new values of `x1`, `y1`, and `c1` will be the components of the tuple at index 1 in the `meats` list. Let's denote this tuple as `(meats[1][0], meats[1][1], meats[1][2])`.

The values of `K`, `T`, `N`, `j`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` remain unaffected by this operation since the code snippet only directly modifies `x1`, `y1`, and `c1`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `x1` is `meats[1][0]`, `y1` is `meats[1][1]`, `c1` is `meats[1][2]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d * (d2 - d)) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `count` is the sum of the number of elements in `meats` for which `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2)` is less than or equal to `K`.**
