Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3. If `c1 * T < c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 3 in `meats`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 1 in `meats`, and the count is less than `K`. Otherwise, the state remains as in the precondition: `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 1 in `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the tuple at index 3 in `meats`, and the count is less than `K`.**
