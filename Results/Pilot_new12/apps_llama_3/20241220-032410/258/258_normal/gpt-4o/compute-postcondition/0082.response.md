The value of `cx` is updated to be the average of `x1` and `x2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the second, third, and fourth elements of either the second or third tuple in `meats` based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the second, third, and fourth elements of the other tuple, `d` is `T * (1/c2 - 1/c1)`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and the values of `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`, and `count` are as determined by the last comparison or not defined if no comparison occurred.**
