The code calculates `d2` as the sum of the squares of `dx` and `dy`. The previous values of `dx` and `dy` are `(x1 - x2) / 2` and `(y1 - y2) / 2`, respectively.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a non-negative integer, `T` is a positive real number, `N` is the number of elements in `meats` and `N > 4`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `d` equals `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cx` equals `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` equals `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` equals `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` equals `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` equals `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`**
