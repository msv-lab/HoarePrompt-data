The function `func_1` calculates and returns the minimum number of segments needed for a given positive integer `n` between 1 and 10^9. It iterates through all possible values of `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`, calculates the number of segments needed as `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)`, and keeps track of the minimum value found. The function handles all possible edge cases for `n` within the specified range, including perfect squares and numbers with a fractional square root, as the loop iterates up to the integer square root of `n`. The function does not modify the input `n` and returns the minimum number of segments needed as an integer value. The calculation is based purely on the mathematical relationship between `n` and `a`, without any external dependencies or side effects. After the function concludes, the program state reflects the minimum number of segments required for the given `n`, which can be used for further processing or analysis.
