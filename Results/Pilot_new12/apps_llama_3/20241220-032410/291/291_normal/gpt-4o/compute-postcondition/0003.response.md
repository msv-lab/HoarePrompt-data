The value of `segments_needed` is assigned as 2 times the sum of `a` and `b`. Given that `a` is 1 and `b` is equal to `n`, `segments_needed` becomes 2 * (1 + `n`). 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `min_segments_needed` is positive infinity, `a` is 1, `b` is equal to `n`, and `segments_needed` is 2 * (1 + `n`) or equivalently 2 + 2 * `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `min_segments_needed` is positive infinity, `a` is 1, `b` is equal to `n`, `segments_needed` is 2 + 2 * `n`**
