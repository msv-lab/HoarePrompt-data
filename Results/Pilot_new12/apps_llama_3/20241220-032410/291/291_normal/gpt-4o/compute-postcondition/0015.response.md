The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9. After executing the function body, the function returns the minimum number of segments needed, which is calculated as the minimum of `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the minimum number of segments needed based on the given calculation.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and returns the minimum number of segments needed based on the calculation of the minimum of `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`.**
