The value of `min_segments_needed` is calculated based on the minimum value of the expression `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`. This expression is calculated for each possible value of `a` in the given range, and the smallest result is stored in `min_segments_needed`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `min_segments_needed` will be the minimum number of segments needed based on the calculated expression for all possible `a` values.

Output State: **The program returns the minimum number of segments needed, which is the minimum of `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9**
