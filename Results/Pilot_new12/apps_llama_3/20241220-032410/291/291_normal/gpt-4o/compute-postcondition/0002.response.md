To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9.
- `min_segments_needed` is positive infinity.
- `a` is 1.

The given code is:
```python
b = (n + a - 1) // a
```

Given that `a` is 1, we can substitute `a` in the equation:
```python
b = (n + 1 - 1) // 1
b = n // 1
b = n
```

So, `b` is assigned the value of `n`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `min_segments_needed`, `a`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9.
- `min_segments_needed` is positive infinity.
- `a` is 1.
- `b` is equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `min_segments_needed` is positive infinity, `a` is 1, `b` is equal to `n`**
