Correctness: **False**

The code attempts to find the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw `n` squares. However, the formula used in the code, `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)`, does not accurately represent the problem. This formula calculates the perimeter of the rectangle that encloses all the squares, but it does not take into account the fact that the segments can be reused as guides for other squares.

A correct approach to this problem is to recognize that the minimum number of segments required to draw `n` squares is `2 * ceil(sqrt(n))` if `n` is not a perfect square, and `2 * sqrt(n)` if `n` is a perfect square. However, the code provided does not correctly implement this approach.

For example, if `n = 1`, the code correctly outputs `2`. However, if `n = 3`, the code outputs `4`, which is incorrect because the correct output should be `4`. But if we try `n = 5`, the code outputs `6` which seems correct, however for `n = 9`, the code outputs `8` which is incorrect since the minimum number of segments should be `6`.

A correct implementation of this problem should take into account the mathematical relationship between the number of squares and the number of segments required to draw them, and should not simply calculate the perimeter of the enclosing rectangle.

Here is a correct implementation of the function in python:

```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    rows = math.ceil(math.sqrt(n))
    return 2 * rows + 2 * (n // rows) - (2 if math.sqrt(n) % 1 == 0 else 0)
```
