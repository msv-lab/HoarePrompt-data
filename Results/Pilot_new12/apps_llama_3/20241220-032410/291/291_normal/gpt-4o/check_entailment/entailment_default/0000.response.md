Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the calculation of the minimum number of segments needed. The program calculates this as `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)`, but this does not accurately represent the minimum number of segments needed to draw `n` squares.

For example, when `n` is a perfect square, the program will still calculate `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)`, where `a` is the square root of `n`. However, in this case, the minimum number of segments needed is actually `2 * (a + a) - 2 = 4 * a - 2`, not `2 * (a + a)`.

Additionally, the program does not consider the optimal arrangement of squares. The program assumes that the minimum number of segments needed is obtained by arranging the squares in a rectangular grid with `a` rows and `(n + a - 1) // a` columns. However, this may not always be the case.

A correct solution would require a more nuanced approach, taking into account the specific arrangement of squares that minimizes the number of segments needed. The current program does not provide this, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
