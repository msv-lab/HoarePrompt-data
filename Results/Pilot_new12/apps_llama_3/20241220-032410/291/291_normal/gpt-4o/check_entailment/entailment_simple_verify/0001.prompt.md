You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
    return min_segments_needed


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw n squares.

The issue with the program is that it does not accurately model the problem. The program calculates the minimum number of segments needed by iterating over all possible values of 'a' (which represents the number of rows of squares) and calculating the corresponding number of columns 'b' needed to draw 'n' squares. However, the program assumes that the number of segments needed is 2 * (a + b), which is not correct.

The correct number of segments needed can be derived by considering the minimum number of segments required to draw the outer boundary of the grid of squares, which is 2 * (a + b - 2), plus the number of segments required to draw the horizontal and vertical lines inside the grid.

For example, when n = 1, the program correctly outputs 2, but when n = 4, the program incorrectly outputs 6 (2 * (2 + 2)) instead of the correct answer 4.

Here's a correct Python function to calculate the minimum number of segments:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())

def func_1(n):
    min_segments_needed = float('inf')
    for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % a == 0:
            b = n // a
            segments_needed = 2 * a + 2 * b - 4
            if a > 1:
                segments_needed -= 2
            if b > 1:
                segments_needed -= 2
            min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
    return min_segments_needed

print(func_1(n))
```
However, even this function is not entirely correct as it does not consider cases where Sofia can use the existing segments as guides. A more accurate solution would involve a more complex algorithm that takes into account the possibility of reusing existing segments. 

However, one simple and correct solution is that Sofia can always draw the squares in a way that requires her to draw 2*(sqrt(n)) segments for the perimeter of the square grid, plus the extra segments required for any "gaps" in the grid where the number of squares is not a perfect square. This can be implemented as follows:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())

a = math.floor(math.sqrt(n))
b = math.ceil(n / a)

print(2 * (a + b - 2) + 2)
```

But actually the minimum number of lines is just the number of the perimeter of the grid where the squares will be drawn plus 2. So this program will be more simple:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())

a = math.floor(math.sqrt(n))
b = math.ceil(n / a)

print(a + b + min(a, b) - 2)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

n = int(input().strip())
print(func_1(n))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9.
def func_1(n):
    min_segments_needed = float('inf')
    for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^9, `min_segments_needed` is the minimum of `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`.
    return min_segments_needed
    #The program returns the minimum number of segments needed, which is the minimum of `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`, where `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
