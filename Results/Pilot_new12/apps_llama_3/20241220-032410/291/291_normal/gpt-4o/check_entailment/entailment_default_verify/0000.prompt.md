You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

        b = (n + a - 1) // a
        segments_needed = 2 * (a + b)
        min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
    return min_segments_needed


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments needed to draw n squares. The issue lies in the fact that the program is trying to minimize the total number of segments (both horizontal and vertical) needed, but it does not consider the fact that some segments can be drawn using existing segments as a guide.

A correct approach to this problem would be to realize that to draw n squares, we need to draw the outer boundaries of the squares, and the number of segments needed for this is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle that encompasses all the squares.

Let's consider the case where we have 4 squares. If we arrange them in a 2x2 grid, we can see that we need to draw 4 segments (2 horizontal and 2 vertical) to draw the outer boundaries of the squares, and then we can use these segments as a guide to draw the remaining segments.

However, the provided program returns 6 for this case, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 4.

Here is an example of a correct program for this problem:
```python
import math

def min_segments(n):
    rows = int(math.sqrt(n))
    while rows * rows < n:
        rows += 1

    cols = (n + rows - 1) // rows
    return 2 * (rows + cols) - 4

n = int(input().strip())
print(min_segments(n))
```
This program calculates the minimum number of segments needed to draw n squares by first finding the smallest rectangle that can encompass all the squares, and then calculating the perimeter of this rectangle. The `-4` in the return statement is used to account for the fact that the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle are counted twice in the perimeter calculation.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` calculates and returns the minimum number of segments needed for a given positive integer `n` between 1 and 10^9. It iterates through all possible values of `a` from 1 to the square root of `n`, calculates the number of segments needed as `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)`, and keeps track of the minimum value found. The function handles all possible edge cases for `n` within the specified range, including perfect squares and numbers with a fractional square root, as the loop iterates up to the integer square root of `n`. The function does not modify the input `n` and returns the minimum number of segments needed as an integer value. The calculation is based purely on the mathematical relationship between `n` and `a`, without any external dependencies or side effects. After the function concludes, the program state reflects the minimum number of segments required for the given `n`, which can be used for further processing or analysis.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
