Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments needed to draw n squares. The issue lies in the fact that the program is trying to minimize the total number of segments (both horizontal and vertical) needed, but it does not consider the fact that some segments can be drawn using existing segments as a guide.

A correct approach to this problem would be to realize that to draw n squares, we need to draw the outer boundaries of the squares, and the number of segments needed for this is equal to the perimeter of the rectangle that encompasses all the squares.

Let's consider the case where we have 4 squares. If we arrange them in a 2x2 grid, we can see that we need to draw 4 segments (2 horizontal and 2 vertical) to draw the outer boundaries of the squares, and then we can use these segments as a guide to draw the remaining segments.

However, the provided program returns 6 for this case, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 4.

Here is an example of a correct program for this problem:
```python
import math

def min_segments(n):
    rows = int(math.sqrt(n))
    while rows * rows < n:
        rows += 1

    cols = (n + rows - 1) // rows
    return 2 * (rows + cols) - 4

n = int(input().strip())
print(min_segments(n))
```
This program calculates the minimum number of segments needed to draw n squares by first finding the smallest rectangle that can encompass all the squares, and then calculating the perimeter of this rectangle. The `-4` in the return statement is used to account for the fact that the top-left and bottom-right corners of the rectangle are counted twice in the perimeter calculation.
