Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw n squares.

The issue with the program is that it does not accurately model the problem. The program calculates the minimum number of segments needed by iterating over all possible values of 'a' (which represents the number of rows of squares) and calculating the corresponding number of columns 'b' needed to draw 'n' squares. However, the program assumes that the number of segments needed is 2 * (a + b), which is not correct.

The correct number of segments needed can be derived by considering the minimum number of segments required to draw the outer boundary of the grid of squares, which is 2 * (a + b - 2), plus the number of segments required to draw the horizontal and vertical lines inside the grid.

For example, when n = 1, the program correctly outputs 2, but when n = 4, the program incorrectly outputs 6 (2 * (2 + 2)) instead of the correct answer 4.

Here's a correct Python function to calculate the minimum number of segments:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())

def func_1(n):
    min_segments_needed = float('inf')
    for a in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % a == 0:
            b = n // a
            segments_needed = 2 * a + 2 * b - 4
            if a > 1:
                segments_needed -= 2
            if b > 1:
                segments_needed -= 2
            min_segments_needed = min(min_segments_needed, segments_needed)
    return min_segments_needed

print(func_1(n))
```
However, even this function is not entirely correct as it does not consider cases where Sofia can use the existing segments as guides. A more accurate solution would involve a more complex algorithm that takes into account the possibility of reusing existing segments. 

However, one simple and correct solution is that Sofia can always draw the squares in a way that requires her to draw 2*(sqrt(n)) segments for the perimeter of the square grid, plus the extra segments required for any "gaps" in the grid where the number of squares is not a perfect square. This can be implemented as follows:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())

a = math.floor(math.sqrt(n))
b = math.ceil(n / a)

print(2 * (a + b - 2) + 2)
```

But actually the minimum number of lines is just the number of the perimeter of the grid where the squares will be drawn plus 2. So this program will be more simple:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())

a = math.floor(math.sqrt(n))
b = math.ceil(n / a)

print(a + b + min(a, b) - 2)
```
