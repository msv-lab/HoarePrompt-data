You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 10^{9}$), the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.


-----Output-----

Print single integer, the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw $n$ squares in the manner described above.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program is designed to minimize the number of segments that Sofia needs to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw n squares. The solution relies on the fact that the minimum number of segments required is equal to the number of segments needed to draw the perimeter of a rectangle with dimensions closest to a square that can be formed using n squares.

The program calculates the bit length of n, which represents the number of bits needed to represent n in binary. This value is then used to calculate the minimum number of segments required.

The formula `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` can be explained as follows:

- The `bit_length()` function returns the number of bits necessary to represent n in binary.
- Subtracting 1 from this value gives the number of bits needed to represent the dimensions of the rectangle (since the most significant bit represents the sign of the number).
- Multiplying this value by 2 gives the total number of segments needed to draw the two longer sides of the rectangle.
- Adding 2 to this value accounts for the two shorter sides of the rectangle.

The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- For n = 1, the program outputs 2, which matches the expected result.
- For n = 2, the program outputs 3, which matches the expected result.
- For n = 4, the program outputs 4, which matches the expected result.

After analyzing the program and the problem description, I could not find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly calculates the minimum number of segments required to draw n squares, and it handles all possible inputs correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single integer input from the user, representing the number of squares to draw, and returns the minimum number of steps required to draw this number of squares, which is calculated and printed as 2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function does not perform any error checking to ensure that the input is within the specified range or that it is a positive integer, and it assumes that the input will always be a valid integer. After the function executes, the program will have printed the calculated minimum number of steps to the console and will have terminated, leaving the input variable `n` with the value entered by the user.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
