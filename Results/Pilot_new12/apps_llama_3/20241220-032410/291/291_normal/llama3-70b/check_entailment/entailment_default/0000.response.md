Correctness: **True**.

The code calculates the minimum number of steps required to draw $n$ squares using the formula $2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2$, where $n.bit_length()$ is the number of bits required to represent the number $n$ in binary. This formula is based on the idea that the minimum number of steps required to draw $n$ squares is proportional to the number of bits required to represent $n$, because each bit can be used to guide the drawing of two segments.

The code correctly handles all potential cases, assuming that the input will be a valid positive integer between $1$ and $10^9$ (inclusive). The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the code for small values of $n$. Additionally, the formula used in the code can be proven to be correct for all positive integers $n$, as it is based on the geometric properties of the squares and the way they can be drawn using guiding segments.

The code does not require any error checking or handling, as we assume that the input will be valid. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
