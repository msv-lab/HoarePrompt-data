The value of `n.bit_length() - 1` is calculated and then multiplied by 2, and 2 is added to the result. The `bit_length()` function returns the number of bits necessary to represent the number in binary, excluding the sign and leading zeros. The result of this expression is then printed.

The state of `n` remains the same, which is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).

A value equal to `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` has been returned at the output.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), a value equal to `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` has been returned**
