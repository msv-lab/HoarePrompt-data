The function `func` seems to be incorrectly defined as it does not accept any parameters, but according to the parameter constraints, it should accept an integer `n`. 

Assuming the correct function definition should be:
```python
def func(n):
```
The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). Unfortunately, the return value is not provided, so the functionality cannot be fully described.


If we were to describe the functionality based on the given information, it would be limited to the input parameter.


Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).**
