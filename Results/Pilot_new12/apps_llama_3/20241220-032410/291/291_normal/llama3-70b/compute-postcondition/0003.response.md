Functionality: **The function accepts a single integer input from the user, representing the number of squares to draw, and returns the minimum number of steps required to draw this number of squares, which is calculated and printed as 2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). The function does not perform any error checking to ensure that the input is within the specified range or that it is a positive integer, and it assumes that the input will always be a valid integer. After the function executes, the program will have printed the calculated minimum number of steps to the console and will have terminated, leaving the input variable `n` with the value entered by the user.**
