Correctness: **True**

The code correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from an equilateral triangle of side length x. The problem states that Memory can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle in a single second, and the length of each side should be an integer.

The key insight here is that Memory can always reduce the side lengths of the triangle in such a way that the smallest side length is always reduced first, until the smallest side length is equal to y, and then the other two side lengths are reduced to y.

The provided code implements this strategy by calculating the ceiling of half the difference between the two side lengths. This is because the smallest side length will be reduced first, and then the other two side lengths will be reduced.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including when the difference between x and y is even or odd. The examples provided in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code.

For instance, in the first example, the code calculates (6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2 + 2 = 4, which matches the expected output of 4 seconds.

In the second example, the code calculates (8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3, which matches the expected output of 3 seconds.

In the third example, the code calculates (22 - 4) // 2 + (22 - 4) % 2 = 18 // 2 + 18 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 6 + 0 = 6, which matches the expected output of 6 seconds.

Since the code correctly handles all potential cases and matches the expected outputs for the provided examples, it is correct.
