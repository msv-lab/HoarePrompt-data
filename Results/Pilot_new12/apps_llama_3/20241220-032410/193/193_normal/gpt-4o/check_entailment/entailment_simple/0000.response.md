To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to understand the problem description and evaluate whether the program meets the requirements outlined in the description.

The problem description asks for the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y`, where `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`. The transformation can be done by changing the length of a single side of the current triangle to any integer value that keeps the triangle non-degenerate (i.e., with positive area) in each second.

The provided program uses the formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` to calculate the minimum number of seconds required for this transformation.

Let's analyze the formula:

- `(x - y) // 2` calculates the number of times we can reduce the length of two sides of the triangle by 1 in a single step. Since we're reducing the length of two sides at once (in a single step), we divide the difference by 2.
- `(x - y) % 2` checks if there's a remaining difference of 1 after the above division. This is necessary because if `x - y` is odd, we need one additional step to adjust the last side to match the target length `y`.

Given the constraints `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`, and considering the transformation steps allowed, this formula seems to accurately calculate the minimum number of steps (seconds) required to transform the triangle from side length `x` to side length `y`.

The reason this formula works is that the most efficient strategy involves always reducing the lengths of two sides at once (whenever possible) to minimize the number of steps, which aligns with the division by 2 in the formula. The addition of `(x - y) % 2` ensures that any remaining discrepancy (if `x - y` is odd) is accounted for with an additional step.

Therefore, considering the problem description and the logic behind the formula used in the program, it appears that the program correctly implements the required calculation for all valid inputs within the specified constraints.

Correctness: **True**
