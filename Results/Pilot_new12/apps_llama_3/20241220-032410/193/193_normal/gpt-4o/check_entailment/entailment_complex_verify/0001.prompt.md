You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to modify an equilateral triangle of side length x to an equilateral triangle of side length y. The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` works as follows:

- The integer division `(x - y) // 2` calculates the number of times a side of the triangle can be decreased by 2 units. This is because in each step, Memory can decrease the length of two sides by 1 unit each, or increase the length of one side and decrease the length of another side by 1 unit each, while keeping the triangle non-degenerate.
- The modulo operation `(x - y) % 2` checks if there is a remaining unit to decrease. If `x - y` is odd, it means there is one more unit to decrease, so Memory needs one more second to decrease the last side.

This formula correctly handles all cases, including those where `x - y` is even or odd. It also satisfies the condition that the length of each side should be an integer at any moment.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- For `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the program outputs `4`, which matches the example.
- For `x = 8` and `y = 5`, the program outputs `3`, which matches the example.
- For `x = 22` and `y = 4`, the program outputs `9`, but it seems there is an error in the example, because following the steps given in the example, we get the sequence `(22,22,22) -> (7,22,22) -> (7,22,16) -> (7,10,16) -> (7,10,4) -> (7,4,4) -> (4,4,4)`, which indeed takes 6 steps to get from `(22,22,22)` to `(7,22,22)` and then 6 steps to get to `(4,4,4)`, not from `(22,22,22)` to `(4,4,4)`. This seems to be an inconsistency in the example, not in the program.

However, after retrying, I saw the sequence `(22,22,22) -> (7,22,22) -> (7,22,16) -> (7,10,16) -> (7,10,4) -> (7,4,4) -> (4,4,4)` indeed takes 6 steps from `(22,22,22)` to `(4,4,4)`. 

The explanation provided by the examples and the code are consistent, which makes the code **Correct**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000, where x is the starting side length of an equilateral triangle and y is the ending side length of an equilateral triangle.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two integers as input, representing the starting and ending side lengths of equilateral triangles, calculates and prints the ceiling of half the difference between the two side lengths, effectively rounding up to the nearest whole number if the difference is odd, and does not return any value (i.e., implicitly returns None), with the program state being modified by the input and output operations, and the calculated result being printed to the console, without any error handling or validation for the input values beyond what is implicitly enforced by the input and calculation operations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
