Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates and prints the minimum number of seconds required to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y` from an equilateral triangle of side length `x`.

The problem description implies that the minimum number of seconds is equal to the ceiling of half the difference between the two side lengths. This is because in the worst-case scenario, Memory can reduce the length of one side by 1 in each second, and then reduce the length of another side by 1 in the next second, until all sides have length `y`.

The program calculates the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y` using the expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which is equivalent to the expression `math.ceil((x - y) / 2)`.

This expression works as follows:

- `(x - y) // 2` calculates the integer part of half the difference between `x` and `y`.
- `(x - y) % 2` calculates the remainder of the division of the difference between `x` and `y` by 2, which is 1 if the difference is odd and 0 if the difference is even.
- The sum of these two expressions is the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
