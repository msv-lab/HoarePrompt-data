The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input provided. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each item in the input, which is split into two parts using the `split` method. The resulting integers are then assigned to `x` and `y`, respectively. 

Since the initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`, this condition is now replaced by the actual values of `x` and `y` provided by the input. However, it's essential to note that these values must still adhere to the condition that they are integers, and `x` is greater than `y`. 

If the input values satisfy the initial condition (`3 <= y < x <= 100,000`), then the output state will reflect the specific values of `x` and `y` provided by the input. If the input does not satisfy this condition, the output state will still reflect the actual values of `x` and `y` but will not guarantee that they adhere to the initial condition.

Therefore, assuming the input satisfies the initial condition, the output state will be: `x` and `y` are integers provided by the input, where `x` is greater than `y`, `3 <= y`, and `x <= 100,000`. However, since we cannot assume the input will always satisfy the condition without explicit validation, the most accurate description of the output state is based on the assignment of `x` and `y` from the input.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers where `x` = the first integer from the input and `y` = the second integer from the input**
