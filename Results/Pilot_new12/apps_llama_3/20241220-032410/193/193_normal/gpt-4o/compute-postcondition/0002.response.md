The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it is implied that the function operates within the context of two integer values, x and y, where 3 <= y < x <= 100,000. These values represent the starting and ending side lengths of equilateral triangles, respectively. 

Since the function does not explicitly accept x and y as parameters, it can be inferred that these values are either defined within the function or are accessed from an external scope. 

The problem statement does not provide specific return values or behaviors for the function. Therefore, based on the given information, the functionality of the function cannot be fully determined.


Functionality: **The function operates with implied integer parameters x and y, where 3 <= y < x <= 100,000, representing starting and ending side lengths of equilateral triangles, but the exact return values or behaviors are unspecified.**
