Correctness: **False**

The code simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input integers, which does not take into account the constraints and the process of modifying the side lengths of the triangle. 

For example, when the input is 6 and 3, the code outputs 3, but the correct answer is 4, as shown in the problem description: (6,6,6) →(6,6,3) →(6,4,3) →(3,4,3) →(3,3,3). 

This indicates that the code does not correctly solve the problem, as it does not consider the step-by-step process of modifying the side lengths of the triangle while ensuring that it remains a non-degenerate triangle. 

The output hints also suggest that the code does not perform any triangle-related calculations or checks, which further confirms that the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect, and the Correctness is **False**.
