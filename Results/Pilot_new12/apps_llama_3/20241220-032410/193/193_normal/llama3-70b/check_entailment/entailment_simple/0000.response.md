Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it simply calculates the absolute difference between the starting and ending side lengths of the equilateral triangles. However, the problem description states that in each operation, a single side of the current triangle can be modified such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area), and the length of each side should be an integer at any moment.

The program does not take into account the possibility of modifying one side of the triangle at a time and ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate. It only calculates the difference between the starting and ending side lengths, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

For example, in the first test case (6, 3), the program outputs 3, but the correct output is 4. The correct sequence of operations is: (6, 6, 6) -> (6, 6, 3) -> (6, 4, 3) -> (3, 4, 3) -> (3, 3, 3). This requires more than just calculating the absolute difference between 6 and 3.

To correctly solve this problem, the program needs to find the minimum number of operations required to transform the starting triangle into the ending triangle while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate at each step. This may involve modifying one side of the triangle at a time and checking that the resulting triangle is still valid. The given program does not perform these checks and therefore does not meet the problem description.
