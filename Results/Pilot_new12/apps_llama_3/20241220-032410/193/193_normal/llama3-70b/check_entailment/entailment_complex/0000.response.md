Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem described. The problem asks for the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length x into an equilateral triangle of side length y, where in each second, Memory can modify the length of a single side of the triangle. However, the provided program simply calculates and prints the absolute difference between the two input integers x and y.

The absolute difference between x and y does not accurately represent the minimum number of seconds required to achieve the transformation. The problem description gives examples of how Memory can transform the triangles in a series of steps, and these steps involve modifying the lengths of the sides in a way that ensures the triangle remains non-degenerate (i.e., has a positive area).

For instance, in the first example, the transformation from (6,6,6) to (3,3,3) involves several intermediate steps: (6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3). The number of steps here is 4, which matches the output given for the input (6,3). However, this process cannot be simply reduced to calculating the absolute difference between the starting and ending side lengths, as the given program attempts to do.

The correct approach to solving this problem would involve a more sophisticated method, potentially involving dynamic programming or a similar strategy, to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform one equilateral triangle into another while adhering to the given constraints. The provided program does not implement such a strategy and therefore does not correctly solve the problem as described.
