You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(x - y))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, if the input is 6 3, the program will output 3, but the correct output is 4 as shown in the problem description. 

The issue with the program is that it simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which does not take into account the fact that the triangle must remain non-degenerate and that each side must be an integer.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should consider the minimum number of steps required to reduce the side lengths of the triangle from x to y while maintaining a non-degenerate triangle. This can be achieved by first reducing one side to y, then reducing the other two sides to y while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate.

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = (x - y) * 2 - (x - y) % 2
    print(ans)
```
This program calculates the minimum number of steps required to reduce the side lengths of the triangle from x to y while maintaining a non-degenerate triangle. It does this by first reducing one side to y, then reducing the other two sides to y while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no parameters, but the input contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print(abs(x - y))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two integers as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths, and prints the absolute difference between these two integers. The function assumes that the input integers are provided in a single line separated by a space, and the program terminates after printing the result without returning any value. The function does not validate the input range defined by the annotations (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000), so it will work with any two integers. The function does not perform any triangle-related calculations or checks, it simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
