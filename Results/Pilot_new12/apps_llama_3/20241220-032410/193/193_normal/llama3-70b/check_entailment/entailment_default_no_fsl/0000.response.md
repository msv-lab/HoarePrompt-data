Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description. It simply calculates the absolute difference between the input integers `x` and `y`, which does not necessarily represent the minimum number of seconds required to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y` from an equilateral triangle of side length `x`. 

To solve this problem, we need to consider the possible transformations of the triangle, taking into account the triangle inequality theorem, which states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side. However, the provided program does not account for these transformations or the triangle inequality theorem.

For example, as shown in the problem description, for the input `6 3`, the program outputs `3`, but the correct answer is `4` because the transformation sequence is `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)`, requiring `4` steps.

Therefore, the provided program does not work correctly for all potential cases and does not solve the problem described.
