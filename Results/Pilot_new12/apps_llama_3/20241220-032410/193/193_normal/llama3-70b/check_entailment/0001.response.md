Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The program simply prints the absolute difference between the starting and ending side lengths, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the starting side length is 8 and the ending side length is 5. According to the problem description, the minimum number of seconds required to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length 5 is 3, which is achieved by the sequence (8,8,8) → (8,8,5) → (8,5,5) → (5,5,5). However, the program would print 3, which is correct, but it's just a coincidence. 

However, the general approach of the given solution is incorrect. The printed number is the difference between x and y which in not necessarily the minimum number of operations needed.

For example, consider x = 6 and y = 4, the minimum number of seconds required to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length 4 is 3, achieved by (6,6,6) → (6,6,4) → (6,5,4) → (4,5,4) → (4,4,4) which is 4.
