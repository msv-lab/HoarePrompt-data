The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, it operates on two integers `x` and `y` where `x` and `y` represent the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively, with the constraints that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000`. 

Since there is no specific output description provided, I will assume the task is to describe the functionality based on typical expectations for such a function, which often involves calculating a property related to equilateral triangles within the given range.

However, without explicit details on the return value, the description must remain general. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate on the predefined integer range defined by `x` and `y`, representing equilateral triangle side lengths, without explicitly defined output based on the given problem statement.


Functionality: **The function operates on predefined integer range defined by `x` and `y`, representing equilateral triangle side lengths, and returns a value based on these inputs, the specifics of which are not defined in the problem statement.**
