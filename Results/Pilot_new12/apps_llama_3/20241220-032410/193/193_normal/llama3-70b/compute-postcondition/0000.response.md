The given code assigns the input integers to the variables `x` and `y` respectively, where `x` is greater than or equal to 3 and less than or equal to 100,000 and `y` is also greater than or equal to 3 and less than `x`. So, `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000 and `x` and `y` are input integers.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
