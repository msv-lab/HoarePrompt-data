The code `print(abs(x - y))` prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. 
The value of `x` and `y` are input integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000. 
Since `y` < `x`, `x - y` will be positive, so `abs(x - y)` will be equal to `x - y`. 
Therefore, the code will print the value of `x - y`. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The output state is: `x` and `y` are input integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, and the value `x - y` has been printed.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, and the value `x - y` has been printed**
