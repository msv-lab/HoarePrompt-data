Postcondition: ***`days` is sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second and first elements of each item in the list, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is either `i + 1` or `i + 2`. If `i` is `i + 1`, then if `i + 1` is less than `f`, `sold` is `min(days[i + 1][0] * 2, days[i + 1][1]) + min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`, otherwise, `sold` is `min(days[i + 1][0], days[i + 1][1]) + min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`. If `i` is `i + 2`, then if `i + 1` is less than `f`, `sold` is `min(days[i + 1][0] * 2, days[i + 1][1]) + min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`, otherwise, `sold` is `min(days[i + 1][0], days[i + 1][1]) + min(days[i][0], days[i][1])***
