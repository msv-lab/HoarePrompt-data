The code `k, l = map(int, input().split())` assigns two new variables `k` and `l` with integer values from the user input. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input string into two parts, converts them to integers, and assigns them to `k` and `l`, respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The initial state includes `n` as a user input positive integer, `f` as a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, and `days` as an empty list. These conditions remain unchanged as the code does not modify them.

Output State: **`n` is a user input positive integer, `f` is a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is an empty list, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**
