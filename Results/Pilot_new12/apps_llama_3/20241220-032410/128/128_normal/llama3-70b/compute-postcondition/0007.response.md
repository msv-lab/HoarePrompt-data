The code appends a new tuple `(k, l)` to the `days` list. The initial state of `days` is a list containing the tuple `(k, l)`. After executing the code, the `days` list will contain two tuples: the original `(k, l)` and the newly appended `(k, l)`. The values of `n` and `f` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is a user input positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list containing two tuples: `(k, l)` and `(k, l)`**
