The code appends a new tuple `(k, l)` to the `days` list. The initial state of `days` is a list containing two tuples: `(k, l)` and `(k, l)`. 

After executing the code, the `days` list will contain three tuples: `(k, l)`, `(k, l)`, and `(k, l)`. 

The values of `n`, `f`, `k`, and `l` are not affected by the code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a user input positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `days` is a list containing three tuples: `(k, l)`, `(k, l)`, and `(k, l)`.

Output State: **`n` is a user input positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `days` is a list containing three tuples: `(k, l)`, `(k, l)`, and `(k, l)`**
