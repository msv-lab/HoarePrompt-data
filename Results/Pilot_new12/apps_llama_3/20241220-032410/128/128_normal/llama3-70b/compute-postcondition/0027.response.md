Postcondition: **`days` is sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second and first elements of each item in the list, `n` is greater than `i + 2` if `i` was incremented by 1 in the last iteration or `n` is greater than `i + 3` if `i` was incremented by 2 in the last iteration, `i` is either `i + 2` or `i + 3`, and if `i` is less than `f`, `sold` is increased by `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`, otherwise `sold` is increased by `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`.**
