According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `days` is sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second and first elements of each item in the list, and `sold` is 0. However, this information does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0 and `i` must be initialized to 0 for the loop to start executing.

State: **`days` is sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second and first elements of each item in the list, `sold` is 0, `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0**
