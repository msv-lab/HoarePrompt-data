Postcondition: ***`days` is sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second and first elements of each item in the list, `n` is greater than 0. If `i` is less than `f`, then `sold` is `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])` and `i` is 0. Otherwise, `sold` is `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` and `i` is an integer greater than or equal to `f`.***
