Based on the given initial state and code, the code `n, f = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of two integers input by the user to the variables `n` and `f`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a user input positive integer, `f` is a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a user input positive integer, `f` is a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`**
