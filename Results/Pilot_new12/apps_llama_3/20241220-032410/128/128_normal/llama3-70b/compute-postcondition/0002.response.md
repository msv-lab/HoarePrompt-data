According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already stated to be a positive integer, it meets this condition. The variable `f` and the list `days` do not affect the execution of the loop. The loop variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't plan on using later, so we don't need to track its state. 

State: **`n` is a user input positive integer, `f` is a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is an empty list**
