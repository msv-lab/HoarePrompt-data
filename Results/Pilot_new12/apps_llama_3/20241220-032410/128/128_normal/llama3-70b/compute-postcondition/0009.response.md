The code line `k, l = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them, and assigns them to `k` and `l` respectively. 

Since `days` is a list containing two tuples: `(k, l)` and `(k, l)`, after the execution of the code, `k` and `l` will have new values based on the user input. 

Therefore, the values of `k` and `l` in the list `days` will also be updated to the new values of `k` and `l` respectively.

The states of the other variables `n` and `f` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a user input positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list containing two tuples: `(k, l)` and `(k, l)` where `k` and `l` are the two input integers, `k` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer**
