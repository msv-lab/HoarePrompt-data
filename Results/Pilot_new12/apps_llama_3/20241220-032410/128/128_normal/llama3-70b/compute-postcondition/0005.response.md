To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is a user input positive integer.
- `f` is a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`.
- `days` is a list containing the tuple `(k, l)`, where `k` is an input integer, and `l` is an input integer.

The loop statement is `for _ in range(n):`. This means the loop will iterate `n` times. The variable `_` is a common Python convention for a variable that we don't actually use in the loop body.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- The loop has executed once, which means it has moved to the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- Since the loop iterates `n` times and has already executed once, `n` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
- The state of `f` and `days` does not affect the loop's ability to execute, as the loop's iteration is solely based on `n`.

Therefore, the adjusted states are:
- `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to have executed once and be ready to execute again.
- `f` remains as a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`.
- `days` remains a list containing the tuple `(k, l)`, where `k` and `l` are input integers.

State: **`n` is a user input positive integer greater than 1, `f` is a user input non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list containing the tuple `(k, l)`**
