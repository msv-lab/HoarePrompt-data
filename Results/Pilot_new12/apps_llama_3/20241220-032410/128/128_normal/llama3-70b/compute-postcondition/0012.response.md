The provided initial state is a line of Python code that sorts a list named `days` based on the difference between the second and first elements of each item in the list, in descending order. The initial state doesn't specify what `days` is or what its elements are, so we'll assume `days` is a list of lists or tuples where each inner list or tuple has at least two elements.

Given the initial state is actually a piece of code, to analyze its effect, we should consider what this code does: it sorts the `days` list in-place, meaning it modifies the original list. The sorting key is a lambda function that calculates the difference between the second element (`x[1]`) and the first element (`x[0]`) of each item `x` in the list. The `reverse=True` parameter means the list is sorted in descending order based on this key.

Since the initial state doesn't provide specific values for `days` or its elements, we can only describe the effect of this sorting operation in general terms.

Output State: **`days` is sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second and first elements of each item in the list.**
