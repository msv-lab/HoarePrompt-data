#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two integers n and f, where n is a positive integer and f is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= f <= n. The input also consists of n pairs of non-negative integers k and l, representing the number of products and clients on each day respectively.
def func():
    n, f = map(int, input().split())
    days = []
    for _ in range(n):
        k, l = map(int, input().split())
        
        days.append((k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: 
    days.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
    sold = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if i < f:
            sold += min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])
        else:
            sold += min(days[i][0], days[i][1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `days` is sorted in descending order based on the difference between the second and first elements of each item in the list, `sold` is the sum of `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])` for `i < f` and `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])` for `i >= f` over `n` iterations, `n` is the original number of iterations, and if `n` is 0, `sold` is 0.
    print(sold)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the maximum number of products that can be sold over a period of n days, with each day having a certain number of products and clients. It prioritizes the days with the largest difference between the number of clients and products, and for the first f days, it attempts to sell twice the number of products available, up to the number of clients. For the remaining days, it sells the minimum of the available products and clients. The function returns the total number of products sold, considering the given conditions and potential edge cases such as when n is 0, in which case it returns 0. The input parameters n and f are validated implicitly as positive and non-negative integers respectively, through their usage in the code, and pairs is validated as a list of n pairs of non-negative integers. The function does not handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., n is not a positive integer, f is not a non-negative integer, or the pairs are not non-negative integers), which could potentially lead to errors or unexpected behavior.
