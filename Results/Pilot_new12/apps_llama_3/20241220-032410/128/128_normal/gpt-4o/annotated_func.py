#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= f <= n, and days is a list of n pairs of non-negative integers where each pair represents the number of products and the number of clients on a day.
def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is a list of length `n` containing the minimum of each pair in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list of length `n` containing the potential sales increase for each pair in `days`.
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales
    #The program returns total_sales, which equals the sum of the minimum values of the pairs in `days` plus the sum of the `f` largest potential sales increases, where `f` is a non-negative integer not exceeding `n`, the number of days.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the total sales by summing the minimum values of the pairs in the `days` list (representing regular sales) and adding the sum of the `f` largest potential sales increases. It accepts three parameters: `n` (the number of days), `f` (the number of days to consider for potential sales increase, which should not exceed `n`), and `days` (a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers, where each pair represents the number of products and clients on a day). The function handles cases where `f` is 0 or greater than `n` by either not adding any potential sales increases or considering only up to `n` potential sales increases, respectively. It also handles edge cases where `n` is 1 or `f` equals `n`, where it sums the potential sales increases for all days. The final state of the program after execution includes the calculated total sales, which is the sum of regular sales (minimum of products and clients for each day) and the sum of the `f` largest potential sales increases (calculated as the difference between the minimum of twice the products and the clients, and the regular sales for each day).
