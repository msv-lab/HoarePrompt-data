According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `days` list. If the list has at least 2 pairs of integers, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `days` has at least 1 pair of integers, `k` and `l` are the first pair of integers in the `days` list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 pairs of integers and `k` and `l` must be the second pair of integers in the `days` list. 

Also, `regular_sales` and `potential_sales_increase` should contain the corresponding values for the second pair of integers.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of at least 2 pairs of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is a list containing at least two values, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing at least two values, `k` and `l` are the second pair of integers in the `days` list**
