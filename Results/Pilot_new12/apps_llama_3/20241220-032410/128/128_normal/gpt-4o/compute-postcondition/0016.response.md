The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, and `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers where each pair represents the number of products and the number of clients on a day. After executing the function body, the function returns `total_sales`, which equals the sum of the minimum values of the pairs in `days` plus the sum of the `f` largest potential sales increases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, f, and days, and returns the total sales, calculated as the sum of the minimum values of the pairs in days plus the sum of the f largest potential sales increases.**
