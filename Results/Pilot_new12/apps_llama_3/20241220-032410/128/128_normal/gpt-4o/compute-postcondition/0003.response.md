The code `regular_sales.append(min(k, l))` appends the minimum of `k` and `l` to the `regular_sales` list. 

`regular_sales` was initially an empty list, so now it contains the minimum of the first pair of integers in the `days` list.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of at least 1 pair of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of `k` and `l`, `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list, `k` and `l` are the first pair of integers in the `days` list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of at least 1 pair of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is a list containing `min(k, l)`, `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list, `k` and `l` are the first pair of integers in the `days` list**
