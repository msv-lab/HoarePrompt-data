The given code snippet is:
```python
potential_sales_increase = []
```
This code initializes a new empty list called `potential_sales_increase`. 

The initial state has the following variables: 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`
- `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers where each pair represents the number of products and the number of clients on a day
- `regular_sales` is an empty list

After the code is executed, the new variable `potential_sales_increase` is introduced as an empty list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is a positive integer
- `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`
- `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers where each pair represents the number of products and the number of clients on a day
- `regular_sales` is an empty list
- `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers where each pair represents the number of products and the number of clients on a day, `regular_sales` is an empty list, `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list**
