`potential_sales_increase` is updated by appending the value of `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, where `k` and `l` are the second pair of integers in the `days` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of at least 2 pairs of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is a list containing at least three values where the last value is the minimum of `k` and `l`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing at least three values, and the last value of `potential_sales_increase` is `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, `k` and `l` are the second pair of integers in the `days` list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of at least 2 pairs of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is a list containing at least three values where the last value is the minimum of `k` and `l`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing at least three values where the last value is `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)`, `k` and `l` are the second pair of integers in the `days` list**
