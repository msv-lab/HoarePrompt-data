The given code initializes an empty list `regular_sales`. This does not change the values of the existing variables `n`, `f`, and `days`, but adds a new variable `regular_sales` to the state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers where each pair represents the number of products and the number of clients on a day, and `regular_sales` is an empty list**
