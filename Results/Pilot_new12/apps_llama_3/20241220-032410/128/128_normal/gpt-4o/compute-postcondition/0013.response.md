The code sorts the `potential_sales_increase` list in descending order. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is a list of length `n` containing the minimum of each pair in `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list of length `n` containing the potential sales increase for each pair in `days` in descending order, and `total_sales` is the sum of the minimum values of the pairs in `days`**
