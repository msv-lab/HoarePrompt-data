According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `days` list. If the list has at least 1 pair of integers, the loop can execute. Since `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0 and `days` must have at least 1 pair. Also, `k` and `l` should be the first pair of integers in the `days` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of at least 1 pair of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is an empty list, `potential_sales_increase` is an empty list, `k` and `l` are the first pair of integers in the `days` list**
