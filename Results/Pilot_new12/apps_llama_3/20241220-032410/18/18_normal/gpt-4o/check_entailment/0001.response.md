Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

Here's why it works for every case:

- For `t <= k`, the number of standing spectators is equal to `t`. This is because each time step, one more spectator stands up, and none have sat down yet. The code correctly prints `t` in this case.

- For `k < t <= n`, the number of standing spectators is equal to `k`. This is because each time step, one more spectator stands up, and one of the previously standing spectators sits down, so the total number of standing spectators remains constant at `k`. The code correctly prints `k` in this case.

- For `t > n`, the number of standing spectators starts to decrease as the spectators who stood up at the beginning start to sit down. The number of standing spectators is equal to `n + k - t`, which is the total number of spectators `n` plus the number of spectators who stood up in the first `k` time steps `k`, minus the current time step `t`. The code correctly prints `n + k - t` in this case.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. All the provided examples are correctly handled by the program, and it covers all possible cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
