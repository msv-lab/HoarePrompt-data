Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It takes the input integers `n`, `k`, and `t`, and based on the conditions specified, it prints the correct number of spectators standing at time `t`.

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the problem description:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the program prints `t`, which is correct because the first `t` spectators are standing at time `t`.
2. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the program prints `k`, which is correct because the wave has reached its maximum height and `k` spectators are standing.
3. If `t` is greater than `n`, the program prints `n + k - t`, which is correct because the wave is receding and `n + k - t` spectators are standing.

The program handles all possible cases specified in the problem description, and it does not include any logic that contradicts the problem description. Therefore, it is correct.

In the problem description, the examples provided also match the output of the program:

* For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 3`, the program prints `3`, which matches the example output.
* For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 7`, the program prints `5`, which matches the example output.
* For `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 12`, the program prints `3`, which matches the example output.

Overall, the program implements the logic described in the problem description correctly, and it produces the expected output for all valid input cases.
