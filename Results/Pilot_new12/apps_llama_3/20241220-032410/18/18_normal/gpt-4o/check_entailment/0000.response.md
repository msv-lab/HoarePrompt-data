Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to correctly calculate the number of spectators standing at time `t` in the Mexican wave scenario. 

Here's a breakdown of how it handles different cases:

1. **When `t` is less than or equal to `k`**: The program correctly prints `t`, because the number of standing spectators increases by 1 every time unit until `k` spectators are standing.

2. **When `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`**: The program correctly prints `k`, because after `k` spectators are standing, the first spectator starts sitting, and the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k` until `n` time units.

3. **When `t` is greater than `n`**: The program correctly prints `n + k - t`, because after `n` time units, the number of standing spectators starts decreasing by 1 every time unit until all spectators are sitting.

The provided examples also support this analysis, and the program produces the correct output for them. Without being able to find an example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.
