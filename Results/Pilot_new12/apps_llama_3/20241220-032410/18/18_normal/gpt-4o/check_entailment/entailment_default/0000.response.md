Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately implements the Mexican wave problem description. It correctly calculates the number of spectators standing at time `t` based on the input parameters `n`, `k`, and `t`.

Here's a breakdown of the code's logic:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of standing spectators is `t`. This is because the first `t` spectators stand in the first `t` time units.

2. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the number of standing spectators is `k`. This is because the first `k` spectators stand, and then the standing spectators start sitting down as the next `k` spectators stand.

3. If `t` is greater than both `k` and `n`, the number of standing spectators is `n + k - t`. This is because after `n` time units, all spectators have stood, and then they start sitting down. The number of standing spectators decreases by 1 each time unit after `n + k`.

The code handles all these cases correctly and prints the expected output for the given examples. The output hints agree with the code and help confirm its correctness.

In the given examples:

- For input `10 5 3`, the output is `3`, which is correct because the first 3 spectators are standing at time `3`.

- For input `10 5 7`, the output is `5`, which is correct because the first 5 spectators are standing at time `7`.

- For input `10 5 12`, the output is `3`, which is correct because the last 3 spectators are standing at time `12`.

Since the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases, its correctness is **True**.
