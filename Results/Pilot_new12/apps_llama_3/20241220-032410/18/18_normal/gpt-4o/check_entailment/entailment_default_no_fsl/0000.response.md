Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately implements the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of spectators standing at time `t` based on the input integers `n`, `k`, and `t`. 

Here's why:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the number of spectators standing is `t`, because each spectator stands one by one.

2. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the number of spectators standing remains `k`, because the `k`-th spectator has already stood and subsequent spectators stand while previous ones sit, maintaining a constant number of `k` standing spectators.

3. If `t` is greater than both `k` and `n`, the number of spectators standing decreases by one each time, so the number of spectators standing is `n + k - t`, because at each time step after `n`, one more spectator sits.

The examples provided also confirm the correctness of the code. For instance, with `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 3`, the output is `3`, which is correct because at time `3`, the first three spectators are standing. Similarly, with `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 7`, the output is `5`, which is correct because at time `7`, five spectators are standing. The last example, with `n = 10`, `k = 5`, and `t = 12`, also produces the correct output of `3`, because at time `12`, three spectators are standing.

Overall, the code handles all potential cases correctly and produces the expected output for the given problem description.
