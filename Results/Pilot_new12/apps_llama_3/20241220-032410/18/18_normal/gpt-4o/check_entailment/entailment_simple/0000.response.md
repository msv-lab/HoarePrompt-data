Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem description.

Here's a breakdown of how the program works:

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the program prints `t`. This is because during the first `k` time steps, the number of standing spectators increases by 1 each step, so at time `t`, there are `t` standing spectators.

2. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the program prints `k`. This is because once the first `k` spectators are standing, the number of standing spectators remains constant at `k` until the `n`-th spectator stands.

3. If `t` is greater than `n`, the program prints `n + k - t`. This is because after the `n`-th spectator stands, the number of standing spectators begins to decrease by 1 each step, so at time `t`, the number of standing spectators is `n + k - t`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases and produces the expected output for each scenario described in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
