The function calculates and prints an output value based on the input integers `n`, `k`, and `t`, where `1 <= n <= 10^9`, `1 <= k <= n`, and `1 <= t < n + k`. It takes no parameters but instead reads `n`, `k`, and `t` from the user input. The function returns no value but prints the result. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it prints `t`. If `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, it prints `k`. If `t` is greater than both `k` and `n`, it prints `n + k - t`. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has printed one of these calculated values based on the input integers `n`, `k`, and `t`, and the input variables `n`, `k`, and `t` remain in the program's memory as they were read from the user input and used for the calculation.
