The code `n, k, t = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input into integers and assigns them to `n`, `k`, and `t` respectively. 

Since the initial state specifies that 1 <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= t < n + k, and the code updates the values of `n`, `k`, and `t` based on the input, the new values of `n`, `k`, and `t` will be the input integers.

However, the constraints on `n`, `k`, and `t` from the initial state are no longer guaranteed to hold after the code execution, as the new values are determined by the input. 

The output state will be: `n`, `k`, and `t` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, and `t` are input integers**
