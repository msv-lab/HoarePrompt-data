The function `func` does not accept any parameters, however based on the constraints given for the parameters `n`, `k`, and `t` which are `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= t < n + k. Since no clear output was specified for these parameters, I can't give you specific details on what the function will return.


Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters but is expected to operate under the constraints of n, k, and t being integers where 1 <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= t < n + k.**
