It seems like there's a small issue with the function definition you've provided for the problem, as it doesn't include any parameters. Based on the problem description, it should include parameters for `n`, `k`, and `t`. Assuming a corrected function definition like this:

```python
def func(n, k, t):
```

Here is the precondition:

Precondition: **n, k, and t are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^9, 1 <= k <= n, and 1 <= t < n + k.**
