To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code:

```python
print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

This code prints the result of a conditional expression. The condition is `t <= n`. If this condition is true, it prints the minimum of `t` and `k`. If the condition is false, it prints `k` minus the remainder of `(t - n)` divided by `k`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer

The values of `n`, `k`, and `t` do not change as a result of this print statement. However, the expression being printed depends on the values of `n`, `k`, and `t`.

If `t <= n`, the printed value is the minimum of `t` and `k`, which means the output is either `t` or `k`, whichever is smaller.

If `t > n`, the printed value is `k - (t - n) % k`. This expression calculates the remainder of `(t - n)` divided by `k` and subtracts it from `k`, effectively giving the difference between `k` and the remainder of the division of the difference between `t` and `n` by `k`.

Therefore, the output state, considering the initial state and the effect of the code, is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer
- The printed value is `min(t, k)` if `t <= n`, otherwise it is `k - (t - n) % k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, and a value has been returned equal to `min(t, k)` if `t <= n`, otherwise `k - (t - n) % k`.**
