The code `n, k, t = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to the variables `n`, `k`, and `t` based on the user's input. The `map(int, input().split())` expression splits the input into three integers, which are then assigned to `n`, `k`, and `t`, respectively.

Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k <= n`, and `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t < n + k`, these conditions are no longer guaranteed to hold after the code executes, as the new values of `n`, `k`, and `t` are determined by the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer**
