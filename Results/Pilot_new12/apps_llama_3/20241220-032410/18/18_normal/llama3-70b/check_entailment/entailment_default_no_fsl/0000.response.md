Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately implements the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of spectators standing at time t, considering the cases where t is less than or equal to n and where t exceeds n. 

In the first case (t <= n), it prints the minimum of t and k, which corresponds to the number of spectators standing as the wave progresses. 

In the second case (t > n), it calculates k minus the remainder of t - n divided by k. This calculation accounts for the spectators sitting down as the wave continues beyond time n, correctly adjusting the count of standing spectators.

The provided examples and output hints agree with the code's behavior, demonstrating its correctness for various scenarios. Since we assume valid inputs, the program does not need to handle edge cases such as invalid or out-of-range inputs, focusing solely on the problem's logic. 

Therefore, based on the given problem description, examples, and output hints, the code functions as expected, making it correct for every potential case within the defined constraints.
