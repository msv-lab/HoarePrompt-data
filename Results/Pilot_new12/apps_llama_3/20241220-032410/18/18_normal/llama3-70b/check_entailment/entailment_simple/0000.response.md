Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the number of spectators standing at time `t`. 

Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. When `t <= n`, the number of spectators standing is equal to `t` because the wave has not yet reached the end of the stadium and the spectators are still standing up one by one. The `min(t, k)` expression handles this case correctly.

2. When `t > n`, the wave has reached the end of the stadium and some spectators have started to sit down. In this case, the number of spectators standing is equal to `k` minus the number of spectators who have sat down. The number of spectators who have sat down is `(t - n) % k`, because the spectators who sat down are the ones whose standing time has been `k` time units ago. The expression `k - (t - n) % k` handles this case correctly.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, and its output matches the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
