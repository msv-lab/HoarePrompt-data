Correctness: **True**

The program provided seems to correctly implement the logic for calculating the number of spectators standing at time t, given the parameters n (number of spectators), k (number of spectators standing at the peak), and t (time).

Here's why the code works correctly for all cases:

1. **Time before peak (t <= n)**: When the time t is less than or equal to n, the number of standing spectators at time t is simply t. This is because each spectator stands one after the other, and no one sits down yet. The code handles this case with `min(t, k)`, which correctly returns t because t is less than k.

2. **Time after peak (t > n)**: When t is greater than n, it means the wave has reached its peak (k spectators standing) and is now heading down. At this point, the first spectators who stood start sitting down one by one. The number of standing spectators decreases by 1 every k time units because that's how long it takes for all spectators to stand and the wave to start going down. The expression `k - (t - n) % k` calculates the correct number of standing spectators at time t after the peak. It subtracts from k (the peak number) the remainder of `(t - n)` divided by k, which represents how many time units into the current cycle of k we are, effectively giving us the number of spectators still standing.

For all the provided examples and any additional ones, this logic holds true. The program does not handle any edge cases incorrectly based on the given problem description, and there are no obvious omissions in the logic that would cause the program to fail for certain inputs. Therefore, the program is correct as per the given problem description.
