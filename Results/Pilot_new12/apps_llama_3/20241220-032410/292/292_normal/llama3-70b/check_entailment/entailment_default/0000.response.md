Correctness: **True**

The provided code accurately implements the problem description. It calculates the number of years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight, assuming Limak's weight triples and Bob's weight doubles every year, given their initial weights as input. The code uses a while loop to continuously multiply Limak's and Bob's weights by 3 and 2, respectively, until Limak's weight is greater than Bob's weight. The loop also keeps track of the number of years that pass.

The code handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and examples correctly. For instance, when Limak's weight is initially less than Bob's weight, the code correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become heavier. When Limak's weight is initially equal to Bob's weight, the code still correctly calculates the number of years it takes for Limak to become heavier, which is at least 1 year.

The code also agrees with the output hints. The hints mention that the function accepts two integers representing Limak's and Bob's initial weights and prints the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. This is exactly what the code does.

The only potential issue mentioned in the output hints is that the function does not handle cases where the input values are not integers or are outside the specified range. However, according to the problem statement, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, this is not a concern.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, making it a correct solution to the problem.
