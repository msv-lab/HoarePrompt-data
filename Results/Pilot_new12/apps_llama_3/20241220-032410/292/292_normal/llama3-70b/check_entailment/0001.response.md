Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of full years it will take for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.

Here's why the program is correct:

- The program initializes the weights of Limak (`a`) and Bob (`b`) from the input.
- It then enters a loop that continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight.
- Inside the loop, it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight to simulate a year passing.
- The number of years is incremented at each iteration.
- Once Limak's weight becomes greater than Bob's, the loop exits, and the program prints the number of years it took for Limak to become larger.

The program correctly handles the edge cases and follows the problem description. For example, when the input is `1 1`, the program correctly outputs `1` because after one year, Limak's weight becomes `3`, and Bob's weight becomes `2`, making Limak larger.

The program's logic is also sound for other examples provided, such as inputs `4 7` and `4 9`, where it correctly outputs `2` and `3`, respectively.

Since the program works as expected for all provided examples and follows the problem description, and no counterexample can be found where the program does not work as expected, it is considered correct.
