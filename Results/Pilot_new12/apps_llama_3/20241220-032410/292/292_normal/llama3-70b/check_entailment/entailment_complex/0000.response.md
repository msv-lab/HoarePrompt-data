Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers, `a` and `b`, representing Limak's and Bob's initial weights, as input. It then enters a loop that continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight.

Inside the loop, it triples Limak's weight (`a *= 3`) and doubles Bob's weight (`b *= 2`), which matches the problem description. It then increments the `years` counter by 1.

Once the loop exits, it prints the number of `years` it took for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight, which is the required output.

The program handles all potential cases, including when `a` is initially equal to `b`, and when `a` is initially less than `b`. The loop condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop continues until `a` is strictly greater than `b`, which matches the problem description.

The program's output matches the expected output for all test cases provided, and its logic is sound for all possible inputs within the specified range (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10). Therefore, the program is correct.
