Correctness: **True**

The code accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. The function takes two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing Limak's and Bob's initial weights, respectively, and returns the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. 

The code uses a while loop to simulate the weight increase of both Limak and Bob over the years. In each iteration, Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled, and the number of years is incremented. The loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight.

The function does not require any error checking for invalid inputs, as the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid and within the specified range (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10).

The code also correctly handles the edge case where Limak's weight is initially equal to Bob's weight. In this case, the function will print 1, which is correct because Limak will exceed Bob's weight after the first year.

All the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the code, and the output matches the expected results. Therefore, the code is correct and accurately implements the problem description.
