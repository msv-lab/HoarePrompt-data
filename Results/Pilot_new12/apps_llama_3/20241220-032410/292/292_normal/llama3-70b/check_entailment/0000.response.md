Correctness: **True**.

The program provided accurately solves the problem of determining the number of full years it will take for Limak to become strictly larger (heavier) than his brother Bob, given their initial weights and the annual weight increase rates (Limak's weight triples, while Bob's doubles).

Here's why the code works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Initialization**: The program correctly initializes `a` and `b` with the input weights and sets the `years` counter to 0.

2. **Weight Updates and Comparison**: The while loop conditionally checks if Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`). If this condition is met, Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`), Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`), and the `years` counter is incremented by 1. This process accurately models the annual weight changes as described in the problem.

3. **Termination Condition**: The loop terminates as soon as Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. At this point, the `years` variable correctly represents the number of years it took for Limak to surpass Bob in weight.

4. **Output**: The program then prints the `years` value, which is the solution to the problem.

Upon reviewing the code and considering various initial weight values for `a` and `b`, it appears that the program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where `a` and `b` might start with the same value or where `a` becomes larger than `b` after just one year. The provided examples in the problem description also align with the expected output of the program.

Therefore, given the implementation and the constraints of the problem, the program seems to be correct for all potential cases.
