Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why it works:

1. The program initializes `years` to 0, which will keep track of the number of years until Limak becomes larger than Bob.
2. The `while` loop continues as long as Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`.
3. Inside the loop, Limak's weight `a` is tripled (`a *= 3`), and Bob's weight `b` is doubled (`b *= 2`).
4. After updating the weights, the `years` counter is incremented by 1 (`years += 1`).
5. Once the loop exits, it means Limak's weight `a` has become greater than Bob's weight `b`, and the program prints the number of years `years` it took for this to happen.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If Limak's initial weight `a` is equal to Bob's initial weight `b`, the loop will execute at least once, and Limak will become larger than Bob after the first year.
* If Limak's initial weight `a` is less than Bob's initial weight `b`, the loop will execute until Limak becomes larger than Bob, which may take one or more years.

Since the input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e., `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`), the program will not encounter any errors or corner cases that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct, and it will always produce the expected output for any valid input.
