The code initializes a new variable `years` and assigns it the value `0`. The previous values of `a` and `b` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are input integers, where `a` is the first integer and `b` is the second integer, and the condition 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10 may or may not hold, depending on the input values, `years` is 0**
