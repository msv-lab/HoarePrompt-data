The code `b *= 2` multiplies the value of `b` by 2. The initial value of `b` is `2x`. After multiplication by 2, the new value of `b` becomes `2 * 2x = 4x`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is `9x`, `b` is `4x`, `years` is 1, and `x` is an integer less than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`a` is `9x`, `b` is `4x`, `years` is 1, and `x` is an integer less than or equal to 0**
