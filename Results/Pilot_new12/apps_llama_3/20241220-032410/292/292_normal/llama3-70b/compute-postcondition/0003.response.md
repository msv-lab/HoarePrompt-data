The code `a *= 3` multiplies the value of `a` by 3. The initial state is that `a` and `b` are input integers where `a` is less than or equal to `b`, and `years` is 0. After executing the code, the value of `a` becomes `3 * a`, which is 3 times its original value. The values of `b` and `years` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 3 times the original input integer `a`, `b` is an input integer, `years` is 0, and `a` is less than or equal to `b` is no longer guaranteed**
