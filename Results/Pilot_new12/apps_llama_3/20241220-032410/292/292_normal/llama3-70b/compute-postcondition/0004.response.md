The code `b *= 2` multiplies the value of `b` by 2. The previous value of `b` was an input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 3 times the original input integer, `b` is 2 times the input integer, and `years` is 0.
Output State: **`a` is 3 times the original input integer, `b` is 2 times the input integer, `years` is 0**
