The code increments the value of `years` by 1. The initial value of `years` is 0, so the new value of `years` is 1. The values of `a` and `b` are not affected by the code, so they remain the same. 

Output State: **`a` is 3 times the original input integer, `b` is 2 times the input integer, `years` is 1**
