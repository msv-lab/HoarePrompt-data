According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `a` and `b` are input integers, and the condition 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10 may or may not hold, depending on the input values, and `years` is 0. For the loop to execute, `a` must be less than or equal to `b`. The condition of `years` does not affect the loop execution. 

State: **`a` and `b` are input integers where `a` is less than or equal to `b`, and `years` is 0**
