To determine the output state, we analyze the given code and initial state. The code snippet is `a *= 3`, which means `a` is multiplied by 3.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is `9x`,
- `b` is `4x`,
- `x` is an integer less than or equal to 0,
- `years` is 2.

The operation `a *= 3` affects only the variable `a`. Thus, `a` becomes `3 * 9x = 27x`.

The other variables `b`, `x`, and `years` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, their states remain the same.

So, the output state is:
- `a` is `27x`,
- `b` is `4x`,
- `x` is an integer less than or equal to 0,
- `years` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is `27x`, `b` is `4x`, `x` is an integer less than or equal to 0, `years` is 2**
