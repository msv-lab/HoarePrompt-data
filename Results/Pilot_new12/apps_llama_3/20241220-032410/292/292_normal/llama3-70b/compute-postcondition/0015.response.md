The variable `years` is printed. Since `print` is a function that returns `None`, this does not directly change any variable. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`a` remains `3^years` times the original value of `a`, and `b` remains `2^years` times the original value of `b`. 
`years` is still the number of iterations until `a` exceeds `b`, unless `a` is initially greater than `b`, in which case `years` is 0 and `a` and `b` retain their original values.
The original value of `years` has been returned and printed at the output. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is `3^years` times the original value of `a`, `b` is `2^years` times the original value of `b`, `years` is the number of iterations until `a` exceeds `b`, unless `a` is initially greater than `b`, in which case `years` is 0 and `a` and `b` retain their original values, and the value of `years` has been printed.

Output State: **`a` is `3^years` times the original value of `a`, `b` is `2^years` times the original value of `b`, `years` is the number of iterations until `a` exceeds `b`, unless `a` is initially greater than `b`, in which case `years` is 0 and `a` and `b` retain their original values, and the value of `years` has been printed.**
