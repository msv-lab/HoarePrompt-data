To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and how the given Python code affects it.

Initially, `a` is 3 times the original input integer, and `b` is 2 times the input integer. Let's denote the original input integer as `x`. So, we have:
- `a = 3x`
- `b = 2x`
- `years = 1`

The condition given is that `a` must be less than or equal to `b`, which implies `3x ≤ 2x`. Simplifying this inequality, we get `x ≤ 0`. This means the original input integer `x` must be less than or equal to 0 to satisfy the condition.

Now, let's execute the given code:
```python
a *= 3
```
This line of code multiplies the current value of `a` by 3. So, the new value of `a` becomes:
- `a = 3 * (3x) = 9x`

The values of `b` and `years` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code. Therefore, after executing the code, the state of the variables is:
- `a = 9x`
- `b = 2x`
- `years = 1`
- The original input integer `x` must still be less than or equal to 0 to satisfy the initial condition `a ≤ b`, which now translates to `9x ≤ 2x`, implying `x ≤ 0` still holds as a constraint from the initial condition but is further constrained by the new relationship between `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a = 9x`, `b = 2x`, `years = 1`, and `x` is an integer less than or equal to 0**
