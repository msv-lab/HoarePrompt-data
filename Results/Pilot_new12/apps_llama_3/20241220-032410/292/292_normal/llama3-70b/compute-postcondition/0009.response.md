The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `years` is 1, so the new value of `years` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `a` is still `9x`, the value of `b` is still `4x`, and the value of `x` is still an integer less than or equal to 0.
Output State: **`a` is `9x`, `b` is `4x`, `x` is an integer less than or equal to 0, and `years` is 2**
