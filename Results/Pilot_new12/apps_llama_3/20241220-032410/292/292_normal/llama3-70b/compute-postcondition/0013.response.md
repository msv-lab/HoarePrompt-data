The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `years` was 2, so the new value of `years` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is `27x`, `b` is `8x`, `x` is an integer less than or equal to 0, `years` is 3.
Output State: **`a` is `27x`, `b` is `8x`, `x` is an integer less than or equal to 0, `years` is 3**
