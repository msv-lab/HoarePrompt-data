The code updates the values of `a` and `b` with the input values. The input values are integers and are split from the input string. 

The condition that `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= `a` <= `b` <= 10 is no longer guaranteed because the code allows any integer inputs for `a` and `b`. 

The values of `a` and `b` are now input integers.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are input integers**
