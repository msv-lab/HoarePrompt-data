The code `b *= 2` doubles the value of `b`. Given that `b` is 4 times the input integer, the new value of `b` will be 8 times the input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 27 times the input integer, `b` is 8 times the input integer, `years` is 2, and the input integer is less than or equal to 0.
Output State: **`a` is 27 times the input integer, `b` is 8 times the input integer, `years` is 2, and the input integer is less than or equal to 0**
