The given code multiplies the value of `a` by 3. The initial state is: `a` is 3 times the input integer, `b` is 2 times the input integer, `years` is 1, and the input integer must be less than or equal to 0.

Let's denote the input integer as `n`. Then, `a` is initially `3n` and `b` is `2n`. 

After the code `a *= 3` is executed, `a` becomes `3 * 3n = 9n`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 9 times the input integer, `b` is 2 times the input integer, `years` is 1, and the input integer is less than or equal to 0.

Output State: **`a` is 9 times the input integer, `b` is 2 times the input integer, `years` is 1, and the input integer is less than or equal to 0**
