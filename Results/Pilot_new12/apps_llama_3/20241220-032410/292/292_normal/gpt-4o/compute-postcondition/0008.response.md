The code `b *= 2` multiplies the value of `b` by 2. Given that `b` is 2 times the input integer, the new value of `b` will be 4 times the input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since the input integer is less than or equal to 0, `a` is 9 times this non-positive integer, and `b` is now 4 times this non-positive integer. The value of `years` remains 1.

Output State: **`a` is 9 times the input integer, `b` is 4 times the input integer, `years` is 1, and the input integer is less than or equal to 0**
