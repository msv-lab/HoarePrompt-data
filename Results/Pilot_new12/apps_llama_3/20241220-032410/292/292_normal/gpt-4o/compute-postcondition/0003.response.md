The code `a *= 3` multiplies the value of `a` by 3. The initial state specifies that `a` is an input integer and `a` must be less than or equal to `b`. After executing the code, the value of `a` becomes `3 * a`, which is also an integer since `a` is an integer. The condition that `a` must be less than or equal to `b` may no longer hold true after the multiplication, depending on the initial values of `a` and `b`. The values of `b` and `years` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 3 times the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `years` is 0**
