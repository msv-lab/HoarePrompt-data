The value of `years` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `years` is 0, so the new value of `years` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The value of `a` is still 3 times the input integer and the value of `b` is still 2 times the input integer.
Output State: **`a` is 3 times the input integer, `b` is 2 times the input integer, `years` is 1**
