The value of `years` is incremented by 1, and it was initially 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`a` is still 9 times the input integer, `b` is still 4 times the input integer, and the input integer is still less than or equal to 0. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is 9 times the input integer, `b` is 4 times the input integer, `years` is 2, and the input integer is less than or equal to 0.
Output State: **`a` is 9 times the input integer, `b` is 4 times the input integer, `years` is 2, and the input integer is less than or equal to 0**
