The code prints the value of `years`, which records the number of iterations until `a` exceeded `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `years` are not changed by the `print` statement.

Output State: **`a` is `3^years` times the original value of `a`, `b` is `2^years` times the original value of `b`, `years` records the number of iterations until `a` exceeded `b`, and the value of `years` has been printed.**
