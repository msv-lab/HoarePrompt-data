The code increments the `years` variable by 1. The initial state of `years` is 2, so the new value of `years` will be 3. The other variables `a` and `b` are not affected by the code. The input integer is still less than or equal to 0, and `a` is 27 times the input integer, and `b` is 8 times the input integer. 

Output State: **`a` is 27 times the input integer, `b` is 8 times the input integer, `years` is 3, and the input integer is less than or equal to 0**
