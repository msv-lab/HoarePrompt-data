The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it seems there are external parameters a and b that are integers such that 1 <= a <= b <= 10. 

Since the exact output of the function is not provided, we can't give a detailed description of its return value. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but is related to integers a and b, where 1 <= a <= b <= 10, and its return value is not specified.**
