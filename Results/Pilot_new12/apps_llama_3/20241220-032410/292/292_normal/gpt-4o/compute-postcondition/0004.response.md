The code `b *= 2` multiplies the value of `b` by 2. The initial state is: `a` is 3 times the input integer, `b` is an input integer, `years` is 0. 

Since `b` is an input integer and is multiplied by 2, `b` becomes 2 times the input integer.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `a` is still 3 times the input integer, and `years` is still 0.

Output State: **`a` is 3 times the input integer, `b` is 2 times the input integer, `years` is 0**
