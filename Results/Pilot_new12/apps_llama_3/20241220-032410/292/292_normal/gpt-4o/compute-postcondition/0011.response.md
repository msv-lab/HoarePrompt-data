The value of `a` is multiplied by 3, and the initial value of `a` is 9 times the input integer. The input integer is less than or equal to 0, so the initial value of `a` is less than or equal to 0. After multiplying by 3, the value of `a` is 27 times the input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` is 27 times the input integer, `b` is 4 times the input integer, `years` is 2, and the input integer is less than or equal to 0**
