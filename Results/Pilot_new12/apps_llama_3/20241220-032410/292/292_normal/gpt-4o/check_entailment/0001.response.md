Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the logic to determine the number of years it takes for Limak's weight to become strictly larger than Bob's weight. 

Here is why the program is correct:

1. The program reads the initial weights of Limak (`a`) and Bob (`b`) from the input.
2. It then enters a loop, which continues until `a` is strictly greater than `b`.
3. Inside the loop, the weights of Limak and Bob are updated according to the problem description: Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`), and Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).
4. The number of years (`years`) is incremented at each iteration of the loop.
5. Once the loop exits, the program prints the number of years it took for Limak's weight to become strictly larger than Bob's weight.

The program correctly handles the constraints given in the problem description:

- The initial weights `a` and `b` are between 1 and 10 (inclusive).
- `a` is less than or equal to `b`.

The program also correctly handles the edge case where `a` is equal to `b`, in which case it will take at least 1 year for Limak's weight to become strictly larger than Bob's weight.

I was unable to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. All the examples provided also work correctly with the given program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
