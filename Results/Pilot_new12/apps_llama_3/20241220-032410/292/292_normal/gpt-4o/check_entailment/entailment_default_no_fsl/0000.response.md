Correctness: **True**

The code accurately implements the problem description. It initializes the weights of Limak and Bob, then enters a loop where it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's. The number of years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight is then printed. 

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem. The loop condition `a <= b` ensures that the loop continues until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's weight. The update of `a` and `b` within the loop (`a *= 3` and `b *= 2`) directly follows the problem description.

All provided examples (e.g., inputs of 4 and 7, 4 and 9, 1 and 1) are correctly handled by the program, and the output matches the expected results. The code does not need to handle invalid inputs (e.g., non-positive integers or non-integer inputs) as it is assumed that the input will always be valid. 

Therefore, the code is correct according to the problem description and the provided examples.
