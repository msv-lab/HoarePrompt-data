Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Input and Initialization**: The program starts by taking two integers `a` and `b` as input, representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. This directly aligns with the problem description's input requirements.

2. **Loop Logic**: The program enters a while loop that continues as long as `a` is less than or equal to `b`. Inside the loop, `a` is tripled, and `b` is doubled, simulating the weight changes of Limak and Bob over each year. This is precisely what the problem description specifies.

3. **Year Counter**: The variable `years` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, effectively counting the number of years it takes for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight.

4. **Output**: Once `a` exceeds `b`, the loop breaks, and the program prints the number of `years` it took for Limak to become heavier than Bob. This output directly corresponds to the problem description's requirement to find the number of full years until Limak becomes strictly larger (heavier) than Bob.

5. **Valid Input Assumption**: Given that we assume the input will always be valid (two positive integers where the first is less than or equal to the second, and both are between 1 and 10 inclusive), the program operates under these constraints without error handling for invalid inputs, which is in line with the provided guidelines.

6. **No Parameter and Return Value**: The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value but prints the result directly, which aligns with the problem description's requirements for output.

In conclusion, the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem, correctly calculating and printing the number of years until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight under the given conditions and assumptions about input validity.
