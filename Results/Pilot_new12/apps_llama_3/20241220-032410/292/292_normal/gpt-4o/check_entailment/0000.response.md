Correctness: **True**.

The program seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It takes the initial weights of Limak and Bob as input, and then enters a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight. Inside the loop, Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled, and the number of years is incremented. Once Limak's weight becomes greater than Bob's weight, the loop exits and the number of years is printed.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including the edge cases where Limak and Bob have the same initial weight or where Limak's weight becomes greater than Bob's weight after the first year. The while loop ensures that the program continues to update the weights until Limak's weight becomes greater than Bob's weight, and the years variable is incremented correctly.

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, so I conclude that the program is correct. The provided examples in the problem description also work correctly with this program.
