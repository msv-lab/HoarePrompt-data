Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. Here's why:

1. The program initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the weights of Limak and Bob, respectively, as provided in the problem description.
2. It uses a while loop to simulate the process of Limak's and Bob's weight increase over the years.
3. Inside the loop, it correctly triples Limak's weight (`a *= 3`) and doubles Bob's weight (`b *= 2`) for each year, as per the problem description.
4. The loop continues as long as Limak's weight is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`a <= b`).
5. Once Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight, the loop ends, and the program prints the number of years (`years`) it took for this to happen.

The program accurately handles all possible cases, including when Limak and Bob have the same initial weight, as demonstrated by the example input `1 1`, which outputs `1`. In this case, the while loop still runs once, correctly tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight, resulting in Limak becoming heavier than Bob after one year.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and will produce the correct output for any valid input.
