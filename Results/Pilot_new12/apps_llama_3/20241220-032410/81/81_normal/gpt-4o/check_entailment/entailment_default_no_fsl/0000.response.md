Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the problem description. It first checks if `y` is divisible by `x`, which is a necessary condition for a pair of integers to be considered "good". If `y` is not divisible by `x`, the function immediately returns 0.

If `y` is divisible by `x`, the function calculates the number of pairs of divisors of `y` that meet the conditions. It iterates over all possible divisors of `z = y // x`, and for each divisor `i`, it calculates the corresponding divisor `z // i`. It then checks if both `i * x` and `z // i * x` are within the range `[l, r]`, and if their greatest common divisor is `x` and their product is `y`. If all these conditions are met, it increments the count accordingly (once for pairs of equal divisors and twice for pairs of distinct divisors).

The code handles all potential edge cases, including cases where `y` is not divisible by `x`, cases where there are no divisors of `y` within the range `[l, r]`, and cases where `a` equals `b`. The code also agrees with the provided output hints and examples.

For example, in the first example where `l = 1`, `r = 2`, `x = 1`, and `y = 2`, the code correctly outputs `2`, which corresponds to the pairs `(1, 2)` and `(2, 1)`.

In the second example where `l = 1`, `r = 12`, `x = 1`, and `y = 12`, the code correctly outputs `4`, which corresponds to the pairs `(1, 12)`, `(12, 1)`, `(3, 4)`, and `(4, 3)`.

In the third example where `l = 50`, `r = 100`, `x = 3`, and `y = 30`, the code correctly outputs `0`, because there are no pairs of divisors of `30` within the range `[50, 100]` that meet the conditions.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
