Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly counts the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) that satisfy the conditions l ≤ a, b ≤ r, GCD(a, b) = x, and LCM(a, b) = y.

The program first checks if y is divisible by x. If not, it immediately returns 0, as the conditions cannot be met.

Then, it calculates z = y // x and iterates over all possible divisors of z. For each divisor i, it calculates a = i * x and b = z // i * x. If both a and b are within the range [l, r] and their GCD is x and LCM is y, it increments the count by 1 if a == b and by 2 if a!= b.

The program correctly handles the case where a == b and where a!= b, and it only counts pairs that satisfy all the conditions. The examples provided also support the correctness of the program.

The key to the program's correctness is the observation that if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, then a * b = x * y, and a and b must be of the form a = i * x and b = z // i * x, where i is a divisor of z = y // x.

Therefore, the program exhaustively checks all possible pairs that satisfy the conditions, and its output is correct for all possible inputs.
