Correctness: **True**

The given code appears to correctly implement the problem description. It checks if `y` is divisible by `x` and returns 0 if not. Then, it calculates the number of pairs of divisors of `y` that meet the conditions: both divisors are within the range `[l, r]`, their greatest common divisor is `x`, and their product is `y`.

The code handles all potential edge cases, such as cases where `y` is not divisible by `x`, cases where there are no divisors of `y` within the range `[l, r]`, and cases where `a` equals `b`. The code also correctly counts each pair of distinct divisors twice and each pair of equal divisors once.

The output hints agree with the code, providing additional insight into the functionality of the code. The hints explain that the function returns the count of pairs of divisors of `y` that satisfy the given conditions, handling all edge cases.

The code also passes the provided examples, correctly calculating the number of good pairs of integers for each input case.

Since the code appears to correctly implement the problem description and handles all potential edge cases, the correctness of the code is **True**.
