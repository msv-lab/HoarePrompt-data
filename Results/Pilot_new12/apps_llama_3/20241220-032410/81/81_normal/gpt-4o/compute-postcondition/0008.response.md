The value of `b` is calculated as `z // i * x`. Given that `z` is equal to `y // x` and `i` is 1, `b` is equal to `z // 1 * x`, which simplifies to `z * x`. Since `z` is `y // x`, `b` is equal to `(y // x) * x`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is a positive integer equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is equal to `x`, and `b` is equal to `y`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is a positive integer equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, `a` is equal to `x`, and `b` is equal to `y`**
