Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is `y // x` and `z` must be greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `a` is `3 * x`, `b` is `y // 3`. If `a` equals `b`, then `count` is the previous value of `count` plus 1. Otherwise, `count` is increased by 2.***
