Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is a positive integer equal to `y // x`. If `l <= x <= r` and `l <= y <= r` and the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` is `x` and the product of `x` and `y` divided by their greatest common divisor is `y`, then `a` and `b` are within the range `[l, r]`. If `x` equals `y`, then `count` is 1 and `a` is equal to `x` and also equal to `y` and `b` is equal to `y` and also equal to `x`. Otherwise, `count` is 2, `a` is `x`, `b` is `y`, and `a` is not equal to `b`.***
