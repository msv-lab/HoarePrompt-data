Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is `y // x` and `z` must be greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `a` is `3 * x`, and `b` is `y // 3`. If `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r` and `math.gcd(a, b) == x` and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`, then if `a` equals `b`, `count` is increased by 1, otherwise `count` is increased by 2.***
