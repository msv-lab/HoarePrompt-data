The variable `a` is assigned the value of `i` multiplied by `x`. Given that `i` is 3 and `x` is an integer such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, and `z` is `y // x` which must be greater than or equal to 9, we can determine that `a` is `3 * x`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is `y // x` and `z` must be greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `a` is `3 * x`**
