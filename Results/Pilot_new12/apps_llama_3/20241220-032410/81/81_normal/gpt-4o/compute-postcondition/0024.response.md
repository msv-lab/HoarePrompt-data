Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is `y // x`, `i` is 2. If `z` is divisible by `i`, then `a` is `2 * x` and `b` is `y // 2`. If `l <= a <= r` and `l <= b <= r` and `math.gcd(a, b) == x` and `a * b // math.gcd(a, b) == y`, then `a` equals `b` implies that if `x` equals `y`, `count` is 2, otherwise `count` is 3, and `a` does not equal `b` implies that if `x` equals `y`, `count` is 3, otherwise `count` is 4. If `z` is not divisible by `i`, then `count` remains as initially set, i.e., if `x` equals `y`, then `count` is 1, `a` is `x`, and `b` is `y`, otherwise `count` is 2, `a` is `x`, and `b` is `y`.***
