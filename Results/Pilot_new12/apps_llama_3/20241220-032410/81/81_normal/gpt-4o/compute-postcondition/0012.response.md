Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is a positive integer equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, the current value of `a` is equal to `x`, the current value of `b` is equal to `y`, `a` and `b` are within the range `[l, r]`, the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is `x`, the product of `a` and `b` divided by their greatest common divisor is `y`, and `a` is not equal to `b`**
