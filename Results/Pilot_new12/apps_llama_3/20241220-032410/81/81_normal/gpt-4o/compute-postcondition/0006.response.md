Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is a positive integer equal to `y // x`, `count` is 0, `i` is 1, and the current value of `z` is divisible by `i` (which is 1), meaning `z` is an integer with no remainder when divided by 1**
