Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`, which are integers within specified ranges (1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9). It checks if `y` is divisible by `x` and returns 0 if not. If `y` is divisible by `x`, it calculates the number of pairs of divisors of `y` that meet the conditions: both divisors are within the range `[l, r]`, their greatest common divisor is `x`, and their product is `y`. The function counts each pair of distinct divisors twice and each pair of equal divisors once. The function returns this count, which represents the number of pairs of divisors of `y` that satisfy the given conditions. The function handles all potential edge cases, including cases where `y` is not divisible by `x`, cases where there are no divisors of `y` within the range `[l, r]`, and cases where `a` equals `b`.**
