The function `func_1` accepts parameters `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y`. `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= 10^9 and 1 <= `x` <= `y` <= 10^9. After executing the function body, there are two possible return cases: 
Case_1: The function returns 0. 
Case_2: The function returns the number of pairs of divisors of `y` that meet the specified conditions, where `y` is divisible by `x`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` within the specified ranges and return either 0 or the number of pairs of divisors of `y` that meet the conditions.
