To determine the output state, let's consider the given code and initial conditions step by step.

Given the initial state:
- `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`.
- `z` is a positive integer equal to `y // x`.
- `i` is 2.
- If `x` equals `y`, then `count` is 1, `a` is equal to `2 * x` (and also equal to `2 * y`), and `b` is equal to `y` (and also equal to `x`). Otherwise, `count` is 2, `a` is `2 * x`, `b` is `y`, and `a` is not equal to `b`.

The code provided is:
```python
b = z // i * x
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code on the variables:
- `z` is `y // x`.
- `i` is 2.
- Therefore, `z // i` is `(y // x) // 2`.
- The expression `z // i * x` simplifies to `((y // x) // 2) * x`, which can be further simplified to `y // 2` because `(y // x) * x = y` and then dividing by 2 gives `y // 2`.

So, `b` becomes `y // 2`.

Given the initial conditions, if `x` equals `y`, then `y` is also equal to `x`, and `b` (which was initially equal to `y` or `x`) now becomes `y // 2` or `x // 2`. If `x` does not equal `y`, then `b` (which was initially equal to `y`) now becomes `y // 2`.

The states of `l`, `r`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `i`, `count`, and `a` are not affected by this operation, except for how `b` relates to them.

Therefore, the output state, considering all possible scenarios and the specific changes to `b`, is:
- `l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`.
- `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`.
- `z` is a positive integer equal to `y // x`.
- `i` is 2.
- If `x` equals `y`, then `count` is 1, `a` is `2 * x` (and also equal to `2 * y`), and `b` is `x // 2` (and also equal to `y // 2`). Otherwise, `count` is 2, `a` is `2 * x`, and `b` is `y // 2`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is `y // x`, `i` is 2, if `x` equals `y`, then `count` is 1, `a` is `2 * x`, and `b` is `y // 2`, otherwise `count` is 2, `a` is `2 * x`, and `b` is `y // 2`.**
