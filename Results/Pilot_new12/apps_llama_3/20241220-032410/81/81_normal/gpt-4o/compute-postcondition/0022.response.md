Postcondition: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is `y // x`, `i` is 2, `a` is `2 * x`, and `b` is `y // 2`. If `a` equals `b`, then if `x` equals `y`, `count` is 2, otherwise `count` is 3. If `a` does not equal `b`, then if `x` equals `y`, `count` is 3, otherwise `count` is 4.**
