According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `z`. If `i` is less than the square root of `z`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3. The loop will execute again if `3` is less than or equal to the square root of `z`. Therefore, `z` must be greater than or equal to 9.

State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is `y // x` and `z` must be greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3**
