    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To solve this, let's analyze the pattern of the loop's execution and its effect on the variables `a` and `b`.
    #
    #1. **First Iteration**: 
    #   - `a` becomes the original `b`.
    #   - `b` becomes the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
    #   - For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be non-zero.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration**:
    #   - `a` now holds the value that was in `b` after the first iteration, which is the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
    #   - `b` becomes the result of the original `b` modulo the result of the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
    #   - `b` must not be zero after the first iteration for the loop to execute a second time.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration**:
    #   - The pattern continues with `a` and `b` being updated based on the modulo operation.
    #   - For the loop to execute a third time, `b` must still be non-zero after the second iteration.
    #
    #**Observation**: The loop continues as long as `b` is not zero. Each iteration updates `a` and `b` based on the previous values, effectively performing the Euclidean algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`.
    #
    #**Final State**:
    #- The loop will stop when `b` becomes 0.
    #- At this point, `a` will hold the GCD of the original `a` and `b` because the Euclidean algorithm terminates when the remainder (`b`) is 0, and the non-zero remainder at this step (which is `a`) is the GCD.
    #- `b` will be 0, as this is the condition that terminates the loop.
    #
    #Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed:
    #- `a` will be the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.
    #- `b` will be 0.
    #
    #**Output State: `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, `b` is 0**
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), which is the largest number that divides both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder. After execution, the function's state is such that it returns this GCD value. The GCD calculation is performed using the Euclidean algorithm, ensuring that the function works correctly for all integer pairs, including edge cases like when `a` and `b` are negative, zero, or when one is a multiple of the other. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, as it is designed specifically for integers. It does not modify the original input values outside of the function scope but uses their values to compute and return the GCD.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer result of (a * b) divided by the result of func_1(a, b), where a and b are positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns the integer result of `(a * b)` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` does not return zero to avoid division by zero errors. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns an integer value, which is the result of the division operation. However, the annotations do not provide information about what happens if `func_1(a, b)` returns zero or if `a` or `b` are not positive integers, which could potentially lead to division by zero or incorrect results. The function's purpose is to perform this specific calculation and return the result, but it relies on the correct functioning of `func_1` and does not include any error checking or handling for edge cases.
