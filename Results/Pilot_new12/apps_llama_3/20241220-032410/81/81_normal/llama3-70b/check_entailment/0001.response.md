Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The provided functions `func_1` and `func_2` calculate the GCD and LCM of two numbers respectively, but there is no function or logic to find the number of good pairs of integers within the given range that satisfy the conditions.

A potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input is `1 12 1 12`. The program does not have the capability to find the good pairs of integers that satisfy the conditions, which in this case are `(1, 12)`, `(12, 1)`, `(3, 4)`, and `(4, 3)`. 

To solve this problem, we would need to iterate over all possible pairs of integers within the given range, calculate their GCD and LCM using the provided functions, and count the pairs that satisfy the conditions.

Here's a possible correct implementation:

```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)

def count_good_pairs(l, r, x, y):
    count = 0
    for a in range(l, r + 1):
        for b in range(l, r + 1):
            if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
                count += 1
    return count

l, r, x, y = map(int, input().split())
print(count_good_pairs(l, r, x, y))
```
