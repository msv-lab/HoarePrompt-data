Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the problem description because it only checks for pairs where `a <= b`, but the problem statement considers pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` as different if `a!= b`. This means the code is not counting all possible valid pairs as required by the problem description.

For example, if we take the input `1 2 1 2`, the code will only count the pair `(1, 2)` but not `(2, 1)`, even though both are valid according to the problem statement. 

This oversight means that the code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case, especially in cases where `a` and `b` are different and both are within the given range `[l, r]`. 

To fix this, the code should be modified to count both `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` when `a!= b`, ensuring that all valid pairs are considered as per the problem description. 

Given the provided problem description and the examples, the code's current implementation does not correctly solve the problem for all cases, leading to the conclusion that its correctness is **False**.
