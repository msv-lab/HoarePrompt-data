You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Today on Informatics class Nastya learned about GCD and LCM (see links below). Nastya is very intelligent, so she solved all the tasks momentarily and now suggests you to solve one of them as well.

We define a pair of integers (a, b) good, if GCD(a, b) = x and LCM(a, b) = y, where GCD(a, b) denotes the greatest common divisor of a and b, and LCM(a, b) denotes the least common multiple of a and b.

You are given two integers x and y. You are to find the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) such that l ≤ a, b ≤ r. Note that pairs (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different if a ≠ b.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers l, r, x, y (1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x ≤ y ≤ 10^9).


-----Output-----

In the only line print the only integer — the answer for the problem.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2 1 2

Output
2

Input
1 12 1 12

Output
4

Input
50 100 3 30

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example there are two suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 2) and (2, 1).

In the second example there are four suitable good pairs of integers (a, b): (1, 12), (12, 1), (3, 4) and (4, 3).

In the third example there are good pairs of integers, for example, (3, 30), but none of them fits the condition l ≤ a, b ≤ r.
Annotated Functions:
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(a, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To solve this, let's analyze the pattern of the loop's execution and its effect on the variables `a` and `b`.
    #
    #1. **First Iteration**: 
    #   - `a` becomes the original `b`.
    #   - `b` becomes the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
    #   - For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be non-zero.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration**:
    #   - `a` now holds the value that was in `b` after the first iteration, which is the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
    #   - `b` becomes the result of the original `b` modulo the result of the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
    #   - `b` must not be zero after the first iteration for the loop to execute a second time.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration**:
    #   - The pattern continues with `a` and `b` being updated based on the modulo operation.
    #   - For the loop to execute a third time, `b` must still be non-zero after the second iteration.
    #
    #**Observation**: The loop continues as long as `b` is not zero. Each iteration updates `a` and `b` based on the previous values, effectively performing the Euclidean algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`.
    #
    #**Final State**:
    #- The loop will stop when `b` becomes 0.
    #- At this point, `a` will hold the GCD of the original `a` and `b` because the Euclidean algorithm terminates when the remainder (`b`) is 0, and the non-zero remainder at this step (which is `a`) is the GCD.
    #- `b` will be 0, as this is the condition that terminates the loop.
    #
    #Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed:
    #- `a` will be the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.
    #- `b` will be 0.
    #
    #**Output State: `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, `b` is 0**
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), which is the largest number that divides both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder. After execution, the function's state is such that it returns this GCD value. The GCD calculation is performed using the Euclidean algorithm, ensuring that the function works correctly for all integer pairs, including edge cases like when `a` and `b` are negative, zero, or when one is a multiple of the other. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, as it is designed specifically for integers. It does not modify the original input values outside of the function scope but uses their values to compute and return the GCD.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the integer result of (a * b) divided by the result of func_1(a, b), where a and b are positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns the integer result of `(a * b)` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` does not return zero to avoid division by zero errors. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns an integer value, which is the result of the division operation. However, the annotations do not provide information about what happens if `func_1(a, b)` returns zero or if `a` or `b` are not positive integers, which could potentially lead to division by zero or incorrect results. The function's purpose is to perform this specific calculation and return the result, but it relies on the correct functioning of `func_1` and does not include any error checking or handling for edge cases.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
