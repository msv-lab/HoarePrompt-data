Correctness: **False**.

The given code does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way it counts the pairs of integers (a, b) that satisfy the conditions. 

In the given code, the loop for `b` starts from `a`, which means it only considers pairs where `a <= b`. However, the problem description states that pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are considered different if `a!= b`. This implies that the code should count both `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` as separate pairs, even if `a!= b`.

To fix this, the loop for `b` should start from `l`, not `a`, to ensure that all possible pairs are counted. The correct code should look like this:

```python
(l, r, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
count = 0
for a in range(l, r + 1):
    for b in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(a, b) == x and func_2(a, b) == y:
            count += 1
print(count)
```

This way, the code will correctly count all pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the conditions, including both `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` when `a!= b`.
