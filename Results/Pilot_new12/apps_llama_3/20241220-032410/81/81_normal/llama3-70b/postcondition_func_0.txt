The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), which is the largest number that divides both `a` and `b` without leaving a remainder. After execution, the function's state is such that it returns this GCD value. The GCD calculation is performed using the Euclidean algorithm, ensuring that the function works correctly for all integer pairs, including edge cases like when `a` and `b` are negative, zero, or when one is a multiple of the other. The function does not handle non-integer inputs, as it is designed specifically for integers. It does not modify the original input values outside of the function scope but uses their values to compute and return the GCD.
