To solve this, let's analyze the pattern of the loop's execution and its effect on the variables `a` and `b`.

1. **First Iteration**: 
   - `a` becomes the original `b`.
   - `b` becomes the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be non-zero.

2. **Second Iteration**:
   - `a` now holds the value that was in `b` after the first iteration, which is the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
   - `b` becomes the result of the original `b` modulo the result of the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
   - `b` must not be zero after the first iteration for the loop to execute a second time.

3. **Third Iteration**:
   - The pattern continues with `a` and `b` being updated based on the modulo operation.
   - For the loop to execute a third time, `b` must still be non-zero after the second iteration.

**Observation**: The loop continues as long as `b` is not zero. Each iteration updates `a` and `b` based on the previous values, effectively performing the Euclidean algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`.

**Final State**:
- The loop will stop when `b` becomes 0.
- At this point, `a` will hold the GCD of the original `a` and `b` because the Euclidean algorithm terminates when the remainder (`b`) is 0, and the non-zero remainder at this step (which is `a`) is the GCD.
- `b` will be 0, as this is the condition that terminates the loop.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed:
- `a` will be the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.
- `b` will be 0.

**Output State: `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, `b` is 0**
