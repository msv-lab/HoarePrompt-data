Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two positive integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns the integer result of `(a * b)` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` does not return zero to avoid division by zero errors. The state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns an integer value, which is the result of the division operation. However, the annotations do not provide information about what happens if `func_1(a, b)` returns zero or if `a` or `b` are not positive integers, which could potentially lead to division by zero or incorrect results. The function's purpose is to perform this specific calculation and return the result, but it relies on the correct functioning of `func_1` and does not include any error checking or handling for edge cases.**
