To determine the output state, we need to understand the variables and function involved in the return statement. The variables `a` and `b` are described as positive integers. However, the function `func_1(a, b)` is not defined in the given initial state or code snippet, which makes it challenging to calculate the exact return value.

Given the information, we can only describe the structure of the return value without calculating a specific number. The expression `a * b // func_1(a, b)` implies that the return value is the result of the multiplication of `a` and `b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, using integer division (`//`).

Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, their product `a * b` will also be a positive integer. The result of `func_1(a, b)` is unknown, as the function's definition is not provided. However, for the expression to be valid, `func_1(a, b)` must not return zero, as division by zero is undefined.

Output State: **The program returns the integer result of (a * b) divided by the result of func_1(a, b), where a and b are positive integers.**
