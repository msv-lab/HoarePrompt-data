You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

Annotated Code:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: To solve this, let's analyze the pattern of the loop's execution and its effect on the variables `a` and `b`.
    #
    #1. **First Iteration**: 
    #   - `a` becomes the original `b`.
    #   - `b` becomes the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
    #   - For the loop to execute at least once, `b` must be non-zero.
    #
    #2. **Second Iteration**:
    #   - `a` now holds the value that was in `b` after the first iteration, which is the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
    #   - `b` becomes the result of the original `b` modulo the result of the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
    #   - `b` must not be zero after the first iteration for the loop to execute a second time.
    #
    #3. **Third Iteration**:
    #   - The pattern continues with `a` and `b` being updated based on the modulo operation.
    #   - For the loop to execute a third time, `b` must still be non-zero after the second iteration.
    #
    #**Observation**: The loop continues as long as `b` is not zero. Each iteration updates `a` and `b` based on the previous values, effectively performing the Euclidean algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`.
    #
    #**Final State**:
    #- The loop will stop when `b` becomes 0.
    #- At this point, `a` will hold the GCD of the original `a` and `b` because the Euclidean algorithm terminates when the remainder (`b`) is 0, and the non-zero remainder at this step (which is `a`) is the GCD.
    #- `b` will be 0, as this is the condition that terminates the loop.
    #
    #Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have executed:
    #- `a` will be the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.
    #- `b` will be 0.
    #
    #**Output State: `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, `b` is 0**
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two integer parameters, a and b, and returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD).

```

Return Postconditions: The program returns the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
