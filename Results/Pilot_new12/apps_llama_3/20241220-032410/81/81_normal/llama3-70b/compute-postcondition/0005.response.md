To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is equal to the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
- `b` is equal to the original `b` modulo the original `a` modulo the original `b`.
- `b` must remain not equal to 0.

The code snippet is:
```python
a, b = b, a % b
```

This line of code simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b` as follows:
- The new value of `a` becomes the old value of `b`.
- The new value of `b` becomes the old value of `a` modulo the old value of `b`.

Given that initially:
- `a` is the original `a` modulo the original `b`, we can denote this as `a = a' % b'` where `a'` and `b'` are the original values of `a` and `b` respectively.
- `b` is the original `b` modulo the original `a` modulo the original `b`, which can be written as `b = b' % (a' % b')`.

After executing the code:
- The new `a` is the old `b`, so `a = b = b' % (a' % b')`.
- The new `b` is the old `a` modulo the old `b`, which means `b = (a' % b') % (b' % (a' % b'))`.

However, to simplify the understanding and adhere to the initial conditions and the code's effect:
- The new `a` takes the value of the old `b`, which initially was `b' % (a' % b')`.
- The new `b` takes the value of the old `a` modulo the old `b`, which translates to `(original a modulo original b) modulo (original b modulo (original a modulo original b))`.

Considering the operations and the initial conditions, we see that `a` and `b` are updated based on their previous values, which are themselves results of modulo operations involving the original `a` and `b`. Since `b` must remain not equal to 0, and given the nature of the modulo operation, we ensure that the new `b` (which is the old `a` modulo the old `b`) does not become 0, as that would violate the condition that `b` remains non-zero.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated values of `a` and `b` based on the simultaneous assignment, ensuring that `b` remains non-zero.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the original `b` modulo the original `a` modulo the original `b`, and `b` is equal to the original `a` modulo the original `b`, modulo the original `b` modulo the original `a` modulo the original `b`, with `b` not equal to 0.**
