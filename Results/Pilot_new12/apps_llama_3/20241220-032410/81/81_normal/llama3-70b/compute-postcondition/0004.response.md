To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to examine the condition of the `while` loop, which is `while b:`. This implies that the loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is not equal to 0.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is equal to the original `a` modulo the original `b`,
- `b` is equal to the original `b` modulo the original `a` modulo the original `b`,
- and `b` is not equal to 0.

The condition for the loop to execute again is that `b` must still not be equal to 0 after the adjustments. Since `b` is already not equal to 0 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the next iteration can also satisfy this condition.

However, the adjustments to `a` and the complex expression for `b` do not directly impact the ability of the loop to continue, as the loop's continuation is solely dependent on `b` not being 0. The given states about `a` and the modification of `b` based on original values of `a` and `b` do not provide information on how `b` changes in the loop body, but we know `b` must remain non-zero for the loop to proceed.

Therefore, the critical adjustment needed for the loop to execute one more time is that `b` must remain not equal to 0. The specific modifications to `a` and the expression for `b` involving original values do not affect the loop's condition directly, as the loop's condition only requires `b` to be non-zero.

State: **`a` is equal to the original `a` modulo the original `b`, `b` is equal to the original `b` modulo the original `a` modulo the original `b`, and `b` must remain not equal to 0**
