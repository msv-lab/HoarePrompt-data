The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are positive integers. After executing the function body, it returns the integer result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the result of another function `func_1(a, b)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the result of `(a * b)` divided by `func_1(a, b)`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a and b, which are positive integers, and returns the integer result of (a * b) divided by the result of func_1(a, b).**
