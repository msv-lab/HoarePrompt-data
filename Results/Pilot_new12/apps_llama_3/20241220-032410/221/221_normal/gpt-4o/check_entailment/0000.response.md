Correctness: **False**.

The given program is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of possible values for the ordered pair (a, b). 

The problem description states that two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. To find the possible values of (a, b), we can use the following equations:
1. a + b = s
2. a ^ b = x

We can express b as s - a from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation:
a ^ (s - a) = x

However, the given program does not attempt to solve these equations or iterate over possible values of a and b to find the solutions.

A correct implementation would involve iterating over possible values of a and checking if the corresponding b satisfies the given conditions. 

Here's a simple example where the program does not work correctly: 
Input: s = 9, x = 5

The program does not provide any solution, whereas the correct solutions are (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), and (7, 2).

To correctly solve this problem, we can use the following Python code:
```python
def func(s, x):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a > 0 and b > 0 and a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    return count
```
