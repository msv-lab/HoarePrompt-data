You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are positive integers such that 2 <= s <= 10^12 and 0 <= x <= 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function does not accept any parameters, contrary to the annotations, and does not utilize the variables `s` mentioned in the annotations. It only uses `x`, which is not defined within the function scope, implying it should be a global variable or passed as an argument. The function performs bitwise XOR operations between a non-initialized variable `a` and `x`, then between `a` (now holding the result of the previous XOR operation) and `x` again, effectively cancelling out the effect of the XOR operations due to the properties of the XOR operation (a ^ x ^ x = a). However, since `a` is initially non-initialized (which would cause an error in Python) and `b` is also non-initialized (used in the first line), the function's intended behavior cannot be accurately determined without proper initialization of `a` and `b` or passing `s` and `x` as parameters. The function's return postconditions and actual impact on the state of the program are undefined due to these inconsistencies and the lack of return statements, suggesting it modifies the global state or is intended for side effects only.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
