You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program is incomplete and does not correctly implement the logic to find the number of possible values for the ordered pair (a, b). 

The problem description states that two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. To find the possible values of (a, b), we can use the following equations:
1. a + b = s
2. a ^ b = x

We can express b as s - a from the first equation and substitute it into the second equation:
a ^ (s - a) = x

However, the given program does not attempt to solve these equations or iterate over possible values of a and b to find the solutions.

A correct implementation would involve iterating over possible values of a and checking if the corresponding b satisfies the given conditions. 

Here's a simple example where the program does not work correctly: 
Input: s = 9, x = 5

The program does not provide any solution, whereas the correct solutions are (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), and (7, 2).

To correctly solve this problem, we can use the following Python code:
```python
def func(s, x):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a > 0 and b > 0 and a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    return count
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and x are positive integers such that 2 <= s <= 10^12 and 0 <= x <= 10^12.
def func():
    a = b ^ x
    b = a ^ x


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
