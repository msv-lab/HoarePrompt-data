Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incomplete and does not meet the problem description. The function `func()` does not take any parameters, but the problem requires two integers `s` and `x` as input. The program attempts to calculate `a` and `b` using the bitwise XOR operation, but this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the sum constraint `s = a + b`.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where `s` and `x` are not compatible, i.e., when `s` is less than `x` or when `s` and `x` have different parity. The program also does not account for the fact that `a` and `b` are positive integers.

A correct solution would involve iterating over all possible values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the sum constraint `s = a + b` and checking if their bitwise XOR equals `x`. This approach would yield the correct count of ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.

Here is a correct Python solution:
```python
def count_pairs(s, x):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a > 0 and b > 0 and a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    return count
```
This solution uses a brute-force approach to iterate over all possible values of `a` and `b` that satisfy the sum constraint `s = a + b`. It checks if the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` equals `x` and increments the count if the condition is met. The function returns the total count of ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions.
