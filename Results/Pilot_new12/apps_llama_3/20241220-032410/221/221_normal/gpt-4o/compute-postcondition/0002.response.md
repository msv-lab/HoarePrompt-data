It appears there's a misunderstanding in the provided task, as the function definition is given as `def func():` which does not accept any parameters. However, the parameter constraints mention `s` and `x`. Given this discrepancy, I'll proceed under the assumption that the function should actually be defined to accept these parameters, like so: `def func(s, x):`.

The function `func` accepts two parameters, `s` and `x`, where `s` and `x` are positive integers such that 2 <= `s` <= 10^12 and 0 <= `x` <= 10^12. 

However, since the specific output conditions for the return value of the function based on `s` and `x` are not provided, I can only describe the input parameters' constraints without detailing the return values.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `s` and `x`, where `s` and `x` are integers, `s` is between 2 and 10^12 (inclusive), and `x` is between 0 and 10^12 (inclusive).**
