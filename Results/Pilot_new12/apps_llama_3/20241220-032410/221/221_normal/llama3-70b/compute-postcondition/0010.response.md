Postcondition: **`s` is an input integer greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, `a` is 2, `b` is `s - 2`. If `a` XOR `b` equals `x`, then `count` is either 1 or 2. If `a` XOR `b` does not equal `x`, then there is no change in the state of the variables as per the given else part, meaning the initial state of `count` being either 0 or 1 remains unchanged.**
