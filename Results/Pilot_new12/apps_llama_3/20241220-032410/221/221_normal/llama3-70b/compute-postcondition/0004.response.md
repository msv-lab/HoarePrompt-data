Postcondition: **`s` is an input integer greater than 1, `x` is an input integer, initially `count` is 0, initially `a` is 1, and initially `b` is `s - 1`. The current value of `a` is 1, the current value of `b` is `s - 1`, and the current value of `count` is 0. `a` and `b` have a relationship such that the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` equals `x`.**
