The code `b = s - a` updates the value of `b`. Initially, `a` is 3, and `s` is an input integer greater than 3. 
So, `b` is assigned the value `s - a`, which is `s - 3`. 
The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input integer greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, `a` is 3, `b` is `s - 3`.
Output State: **`s` is an input integer greater than 3, `x` is an input integer, `a` is 3, `b` is `s - 3`**
