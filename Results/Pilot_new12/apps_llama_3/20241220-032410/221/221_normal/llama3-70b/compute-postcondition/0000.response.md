The code assigns the values from the input to `s` and `x`. The input values are expected to be two integers separated by a space. 

The initial constraints on `s` and `x` were 2 <= s <= 10^12 and 0 <= x <= 10^12. However, these constraints are not necessarily enforced by the given code. The new values of `s` and `x` will be whatever integers are provided as input.

Output State: **`s` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**
