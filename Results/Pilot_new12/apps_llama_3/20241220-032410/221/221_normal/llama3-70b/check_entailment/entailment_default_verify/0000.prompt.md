You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. How many possible values are there for the ordered pair (a, b)?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers s and x (2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12, 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12), the sum and bitwise xor of the pair of positive integers, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer, the number of solutions to the given conditions. If no solutions exist, print 0.


-----Examples-----
Input
9 5

Output
4

Input
3 3

Output
2

Input
5 2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first sample, we have the following solutions: (2, 7), (3, 6), (6, 3), (7, 2).

In the second sample, the only solutions are (1, 2) and (2, 1).
Program:
```
def func():
    (s, x) = map(int, input().split())
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    print(count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all possible cases because the problem constraints state that `s` can be up to `10^12`, but the loop `for a in range(1, s)` would be very inefficient and consume a lot of memory for large values of `s`. Additionally, the range can exceed the maximum limit for a loop in Python.

A correct approach to solve this problem would be to use mathematical properties of bitwise XOR to reduce the search space. Since `a ^ b = x`, and `a + b = s`, we can use the fact that `a = (x + s) / 2` and `b = (s - x) / 2` to calculate `a` and `b`. However, since `a` and `b` are integers, we need to check if `(x + s)` and `(s - x)` are both even.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: when `s` is `10^12` and `x` is `10^11`. The program would try to iterate from `1` to `10^12`, which would take an extremely long time and may even cause the program to run out of memory.

A correct solution would involve checking if `(x + s)` and `(s - x)` are both even, and if so, checking if the resulting `a` and `b` are valid solutions. If `(x + s)` and `(s - x)` are not both even, then there are no valid solutions.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two integers `s` and `x` as input, where `2 <= s <= 10^12` and `0 <= x <= 10^12`, and returns the count of pairs of integers `(a, b)` such that `a ^ b == x` and `a + b == s`, where `a` ranges from `1` to `s - 1`. The function effectively calculates the number of ways to express `x` as the bitwise XOR of two numbers whose sum is `s`, and prints this count as its output. The state of the program after execution is that it has consumed the input integers `s` and `x`, and has printed the count of such pairs to the console, with no modifications made to the input values. The function handles all edge cases within the specified input ranges and does not perform any error checking or handling for inputs outside these ranges.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
