According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If the list has at least 1 coordinate, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x` equals positive infinity, `min_y` equals positive infinity, `max_x` equals negative infinity, `max_y` equals negative infinity. For the loop to be executed, the `white_pixels` list must have at least 1 coordinate, `x` is the x-coordinate of the first white pixel, and `y` is the y-coordinate of the first white pixel.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w' and must have at least 1 coordinate, `x` is the x-coordinate of the first white pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the first white pixel, `min_x` equals positive infinity, `min_y` equals positive infinity, `max_x` equals negative infinity, `max_y` equals negative infinity**
