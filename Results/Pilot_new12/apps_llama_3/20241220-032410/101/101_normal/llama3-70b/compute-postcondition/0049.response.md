Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame and initially `'.'` are set to `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0. Additionally, it is not the case that (`i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y`) and `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, which implies that either (`i` is not equal to `min_x` and `i` is not equal to `max_x` and `j` is not equal to `min_y` and `j` is not equal to `max_y`) or `pixels[i][j]` is not `'.'`. Furthermore, the pixel at position `(i, j)` in `pixels` is not `'w'`.**
