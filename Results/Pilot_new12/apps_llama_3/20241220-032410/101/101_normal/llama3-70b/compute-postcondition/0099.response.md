The function `func` accepts a list of strings as input. The first string contains two positive integers `n` and `m` (1 ≤ `n`, `m` ≤ 2000) separated by a space, representing the resolution of the monitor. The next `n` strings contain exactly `m` characters each, where each character is either '.' (period, ASCII code 46) representing a black pixel or 'w' (lowercase English letter w) representing a white pixel. 

Since the problem statement does not specify the output of the function, it is not possible to determine the return value.


Functionality: **The function accepts a list of strings representing a monitor resolution and pixel data, but the return value is unspecified.**
