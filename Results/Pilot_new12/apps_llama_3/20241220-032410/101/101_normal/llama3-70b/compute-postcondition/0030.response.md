The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the character '+' to the `j-th` element of the `i-th` sublist in the 2D list `pixels`. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` are not affected by this code. The value of `i` remains the same, and `j` is increased by 1.

The 2D list `pixels` now has an updated value at the position `[i][j]`, which is '+'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and at least 2, `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters and `pixels[i][j]` is '+', `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and `j` is increased by 1, `i` remains the same**
