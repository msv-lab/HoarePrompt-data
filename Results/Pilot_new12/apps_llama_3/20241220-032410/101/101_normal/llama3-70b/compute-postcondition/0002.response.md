The code generates a list of coordinates `white_pixels` where the value in the 2D list `pixels` is 'w'. 

`white_pixels` is assigned the value of a list comprehension that iterates over each element in the 2D list `pixels`. For each element `pixels[i][j]`, if the value is 'w', it adds the coordinates `(i, j)` to the list `white_pixels`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), the value of `m` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), and the value of `pixels` remains a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w').

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), and `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), and `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w'**
