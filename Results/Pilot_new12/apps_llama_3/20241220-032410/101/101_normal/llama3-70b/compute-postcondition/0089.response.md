To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(m):
    if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
        pixels[i][j] = '+'
    elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
        continue
    else:
        pixels[i][j] = '.'
```
From the loop code, we can see that:

1. The loop iterates over the range of `m`.
2. For each iteration, it checks the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`. If both conditions are true, it sets `pixels[i][j]` to `'+'`.
3. If `pixels[i][j]` is equal to `'w'`, the loop continues to the next iteration.
4. If neither of the above conditions is true, it sets `pixels[i][j]` to `'.'`.

From the provided output states, we can see that:

1. After the first iteration, `j` equals 0, and `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'` if the condition is true, or `'.'` otherwise.
2. After the second iteration, `j` equals 1, and `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'` if the condition is true, or `'.'` otherwise.
3. After the third iteration, `j` equals 2, and `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'` if the condition is true, or `'.'` otherwise.

Based on the loop code and the output states, we can infer that:

* The loop will execute `m` times, and after each iteration, `j` will increment by 1.
* For each iteration, `pixels[i][j]` will be set to `'+'` if the condition `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` is true and `pixels[i][j]` is equal to `'.'`, or `'.'` otherwise.
* If `pixels[i][j]` is equal to `'w'`, the loop will continue to the next iteration.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be:

* `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 (unchanged).
* `m` is a non-negative integer (unchanged).
* `i` equals 2 (unchanged).
* `j` equals `m` (since the loop iterates `m` times).
* `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[i][j]` equals `'+'` if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and the original value of `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, or `'.'` otherwise. If the original value of `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, it remains unchanged.
* `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (unchanged).
* `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels` (unchanged).
* `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m` (unchanged).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `i` equals 2, `j` equals `m`, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[2][j]` equals `'+'` if `(2 == min_x or 2 == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and the original value of `pixels[2][j]` is `'.'`, or `'.'` otherwise, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.**
