The value of `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`. The previous value of `pixels[i][j]` is not specified, but it is known that `pixels[i][j]` is not `'w'`. Other variables are not affected by this code. 

The states of `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `i`, and `j` remain the same as they were before the code was executed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'` and pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and it is not the case that (`i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y`)**
