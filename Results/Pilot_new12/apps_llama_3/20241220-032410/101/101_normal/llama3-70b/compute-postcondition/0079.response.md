The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since there is no loop specified in the given code snippet, we assume it is part of a larger loop.

Given the initial state: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where the value of `pixels[2][1]` depends on the conditions specified, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1.

The `continue` statement does not modify any variables. It only affects the flow of the program by skipping to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where the value of `pixels[2][1]` depends on the conditions specified, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
