The code changes the value of `pixels` at position `[i][j]` to `'+'`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, `pixels[1][1]` becomes `'+'`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[1][1]` is `'+'` and pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
