According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` is set to `m`, but for the loop to execute, `j` should be set to 0, which is the starting index of the range. The loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `m-1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame and initially `'.'` are set to `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0**
