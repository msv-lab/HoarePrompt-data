According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels` list. If the list has at least one more row, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pixels` is a 2D list with at least 1 row. So for the loop to execute one more time, `pixels` must have at least one more row. Since `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the original frame, and the current state of `pixels` has been printed, we don't need to adjust `n` or `m`. Also, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` are not directly related to the loop condition. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list with at least 2 rows where pixels on the border of the frame and originally `'.'` are `'+'` and other non-'w' pixels are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of 'w' pixel coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`**
