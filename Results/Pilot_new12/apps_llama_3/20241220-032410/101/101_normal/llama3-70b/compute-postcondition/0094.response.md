The given code snippet is a print statement that prints each row of the `pixels` 2D list as a string, without any modifications to the variables. The `join` function concatenates all the elements in each row into a single string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list with at least 2 rows where pixels on the border of the frame and originally `'.'` are `'+'` and other non-'w' pixels are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of 'w' pixel coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and the string representation of each row in `pixels` has been printed.**
