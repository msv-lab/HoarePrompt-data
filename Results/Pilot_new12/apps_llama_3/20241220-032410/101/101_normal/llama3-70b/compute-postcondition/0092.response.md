The code provided is a print statement that prints each row of the `pixels` 2D list as a string. The `''.join(row)` expression concatenates all the elements of a row into a single string. 

After the print statement, the program will output the current state of the `pixels` 2D list to the console, but it does not modify any variables. The states of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list with at least 1 row where pixels on the border of the frame and originally `'.'` are `'+'` and other non-'w' pixels are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of 'w' pixel coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and the current state of `pixels` has been printed to the console.**
