The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` changes the value of the pixel at position `(i, j)` in the `pixels` 2D list to `'.'`. The previous value of `pixels[i][j]` is not specified, but it is updated to `'.'`. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, so `pixels[1][2]` is assigned the value `'.'`. The states of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[1][2]` is `'.'` and pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
