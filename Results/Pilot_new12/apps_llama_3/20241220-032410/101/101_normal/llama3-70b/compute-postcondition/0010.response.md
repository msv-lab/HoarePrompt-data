According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If the list has at least 3 coordinates, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` has at least 2 coordinates, `x` is the x-coordinate of the second white pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the second white pixel. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 coordinates. The third coordinate will be the new `x` and `y` values. `min_x` and `min_y` will be the minimum of their current values and the new `x` and `y` values. `max_x` and `max_y` will be the maximum of their current values and the new `x` and `y` values.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w' and must have at least 3 coordinates, `x` is the x-coordinate of the third white pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the third white pixel, `min_x` is the minimum of its original value and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of its original value and `y`, `max_x` is the maximum of its original value and `x`, `max_y` is the maximum of its original value and `y`**
