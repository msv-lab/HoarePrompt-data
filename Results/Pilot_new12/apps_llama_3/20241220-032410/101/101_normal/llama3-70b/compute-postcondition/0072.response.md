The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'` and it is not the case that `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, the loop will continue to the next iteration. 

The values of the variables do not change, but we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where originally `pixels[1][j]` equals `'+'` if `(1 == min_x or 1 == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'` otherwise if `pixels[1][j]` is not `'w'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.
