The code assigns the value '+' to `pixels[i][j]`. The previous value of `i` is 2 and the previous value of `j` is 2. Therefore, `pixels[2][2]` is now '+'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 1, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 2, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, and `pixels[2][2]` equals '+'**
