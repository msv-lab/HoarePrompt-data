The code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` by taking the minimum of their original values and `x` and `y` respectively. 

`min_x` becomes the minimum of its original value and `x`, which is the x-coordinate of the third white pixel. 
`min_y` becomes the minimum of its original value and `y`, which is the y-coordinate of the third white pixel.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w' and must have at least 3 coordinates, `x` is the x-coordinate of the third white pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the third white pixel, `min_x` is the minimum of its original value and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of its original value and `y`, `max_x` is the maximum of its original value and `x`, `max_y` is the maximum of its original value and `y`**
