According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels` list. If the `pixels` list has at least 1 row, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list, `white_pixels` is a list of 'w' pixel coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, and `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`. For the loop to be executed, the `pixels` list must have at least 1 row. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list with at least 1 row where pixels on the border of the frame and originally `'.'` are `'+'` and other non-'w' pixels are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of 'w' pixel coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m**, row is the first row in the `pixels` list**
