The given code is a `continue` statement. The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. 

In this case, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, we can assume that this `continue` statement is part of a loop (likely a for or while loop) that is defined elsewhere in the code. 

When the `continue` statement is executed, it will skip the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and move on to the next iteration. 

The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `i`, `j`, `frame_size`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are not changed by the `continue` statement.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 1, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 2, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 1, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 2, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
