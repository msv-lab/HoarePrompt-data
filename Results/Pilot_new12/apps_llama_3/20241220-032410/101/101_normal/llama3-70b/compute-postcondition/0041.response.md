To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step.

The loop iterates over each column `j` in the 2D list `pixels`. For each position `(i, j)` in `pixels`, it checks if the current position is on the border of the defined frame (i.e., `i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) and if the pixel at `(i, j)` is initially `'.'`. If both conditions are met, the pixel at `(i, j)` is set to `'+'`.

If the pixel at `(i, j)` is `'w'`, the current iteration is skipped. Otherwise, if the pixel at `(i, j)` is not on the border or is not `'.'`, the pixel at `(i, j)` remains `'.'`.

Since the loop only iterates over each column `j` and does not modify `i`, the value of `i` remains the same throughout the loop. The loop will execute `m` times, where `m` is the number of columns in the 2D list `pixels`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state can be determined as follows:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `m` remains a positive integer.
- `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters. The pixels on the border of the defined frame (i.e., `i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) and initially `'.'` are set to `'+'`. Other pixels remain unchanged.
- `white_pixels` remains a list of coordinates.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` remain defined based on `white_pixels`.
- `frame_size` remains less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.
- `i` remains 0, as it is not modified within the loop.
- `j` is incremented `m` times and finally equals `m`, as the loop iterates `m` times.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame and initially `'.'` are set to `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, and `j` equals `m`.**
