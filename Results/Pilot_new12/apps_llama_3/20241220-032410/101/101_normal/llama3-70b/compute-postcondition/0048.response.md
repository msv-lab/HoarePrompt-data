The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables. The states of the variables are not affected. 
The value of `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is still a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `pixels` is still a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame and initially `'.'` are set to `'+'`, `white_pixels` is still a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are still defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is still less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is still 1, and `j` is still 0. Additionally, it is not the case that (`i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y`) and previously `pixels[i][j]` was `'.'`, which implies that either (`i` is not equal to `min_x` and `i` is not equal to `max_x` and `j` is not equal to `min_y` and `j` is not equal to `max_y`) or previously `pixels[i][j]` was not `'.'`. The current value of `pixels[i][j]` is still `'w'`. We move to the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame and initially `'.'` are set to `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop**
