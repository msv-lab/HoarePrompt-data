Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and at least 1, `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters. If the current position (`i`, `j`) is on the border of the defined frame (i.e., `i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) and the pixel at (`i`, `j`) is initially '.', then the pixel at (`i`, `j`) is set to '+'. Otherwise, if the pixel at (`i`, `j`) is 'w', the current iteration is skipped; otherwise, the pixel at (`i`, `j`) remains '.'. `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and `i` and `j` are updated accordingly.***
