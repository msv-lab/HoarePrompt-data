According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m` and the current value of `j`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is increased by 1 when certain conditions are met. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`, so `j` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and at least 2, `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters, `j` is increased by 1, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` remains the same**
