The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there are no loops provided in the given code snippet, the `continue` statement will not have any direct impact on the variables or their values. The code will simply move on to the next iteration of the loop it is inside, if such a loop exists, without executing the remaining code within the current iteration.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
