Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and at least 2, `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`. If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', then `j` is increased by 1 and we move to the next iteration of the loop. If `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w', then `pixels[i][j]` is '.', `j` remains the same, and `i` remains the same.***
