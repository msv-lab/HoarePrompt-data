Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 1, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, then `pixels[1][1]` is `'+'`. Otherwise, if `pixels[1][1]` is `'w'`, the loop continues to the next iteration, otherwise, `pixels[1][1]` is set to `'.'`.***
