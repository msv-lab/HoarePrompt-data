According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels` list. If the list has at least one more row, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `pixels` has at least 2 rows, and the string representation of each row in `pixels` has been printed. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `pixels` must have at least 3 rows. The other variables are not directly affected by this loop, so they remain the same. The row that will be processed in the next iteration is the third row in `pixels`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list with at least 3 rows where pixels on the border of the frame and originally `'.'` are `'+'` and other non-'w' pixels are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of 'w' pixel coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and the string representation of each row in `pixels` has been printed**
