The code calculates `frame_size` based on `max_x`, `min_x`, `max_y`, and `min_y`. The value of `frame_size` is determined by taking the maximum difference between `max_x` and `min_x` or `max_y` and `min_y`, and then adding 1. This means that `frame_size` will be at least 1, since the difference between `max_x` and `min_x` or `max_y` and `min_y` is at least 0, and then 1 is added. 

`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'. 

If `white_pixels` is not empty, then `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels. 

Otherwise, `min_x` is positive infinity, `min_y` is positive infinity, `max_x` is negative infinity, `max_y` is negative infinity.

The new variable `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', if `white_pixels` is not empty then `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels; otherwise, `min_x` is positive infinity, `min_y` is positive infinity, `max_x` is negative infinity, `max_y` is negative infinity, and `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`.**
