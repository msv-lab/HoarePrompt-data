The given code is a print statement that prints the string representation of each row in the `pixels` 2D list. The `join` method concatenates all the elements in a row into a single string, and then this string is printed.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list with at least 3 rows where pixels on the border of the frame and originally `'.'` are `'+'` and other non-'w' pixels are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of 'w' pixel coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, the string representation of each row in `pixels` has been printed, and no variables have been changed by the code.**
