The input to the function is a list of strings, where the first string contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000) separated by a space, representing the resolution of the monitor. The next n strings contain exactly m characters each, where each character is either '.' (period, ASCII code 46) representing a black pixel or 'w' (lowercase English letter w) representing a white pixel. The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of n and m from the input string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), the input string contains n strings with m characters each, where each character is either '.' or 'w', and the first string with n and m is consumed as input**.
