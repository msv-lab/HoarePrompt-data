Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If the current position `(i, j)` is on the border of the frame (i.e., `i` equals `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `max_y`) and `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'`. Otherwise, if `pixels[i][j]` is not `'w'` and the current position is not on the border, `pixels[i][j]` remains `'.'` and the program continues to the next iteration.***
