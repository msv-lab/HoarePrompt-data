The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there is no loop provided in the given code snippet, the impact of the `continue` statement alone is that it will skip to the next iteration of the loop it is inside, if any. 

However, based on the given initial state and assuming that this `continue` statement is part of a loop that iterates over the `pixels` 2D list (possibly with `i` and `j` as indices), the state of the variables after executing this statement would not change because `continue` does not modify variable values; it only changes the flow of the program.

Therefore, considering the initial state and the effect of the `continue` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state because no variable assignments or modifications are made by the `continue` statement itself.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and at least 1, `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and it is not the case that ((`i` equals `min_x` or `i` equals `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `j` equals `max_y`) and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` equals '.') and the current value of `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
