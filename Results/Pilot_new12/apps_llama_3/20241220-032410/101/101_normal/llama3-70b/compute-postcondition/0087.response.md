Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 1, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 2, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`. If `pixels[i][j]` equals 'w', we continue to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `pixels[2][2]` equals `'.'`***
