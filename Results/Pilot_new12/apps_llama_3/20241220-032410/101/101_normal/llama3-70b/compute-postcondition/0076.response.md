Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where originally `pixels[1][j]` equals `'+'` if `(1 == min_x or 1 == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'` otherwise if `pixels[1][j]` is not `'w'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 0, if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` equals `'+'`, otherwise if `pixels[i][j]` equals `'w'`, the loop continues to the next iteration, otherwise `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'` and it is not the case that `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)`**
