According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 2.

Other states remain unchanged as their update is not specified in the for loop statement.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is a non-negative integer, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[1][j]` equals `'+'` if `(1 == min_x or 1 == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and originally `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'`, and `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'` otherwise if `pixels[1][j]` is not `'w'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 2, `j` equals `m-1`**
