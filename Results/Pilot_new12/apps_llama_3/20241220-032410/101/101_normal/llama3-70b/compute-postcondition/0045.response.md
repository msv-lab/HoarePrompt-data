The value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'+'`. The previous value of `pixels[i][j]` was `'.'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, 
`m` is still a positive integer and must be greater than 0, 
`pixels` is still a 2D list but now `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'`, 
`white_pixels` is still a list of coordinates, 
`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are still defined based on `white_pixels`, 
`frame_size` is still less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, 
`i` is still 1, 
`j` is still 0, 
and the current position (i, j) is still either on the minimum or maximum x or y coordinate of the defined frame.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[i][j]` is `'+'` and pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current position (i, j) is either on the minimum or maximum x or y coordinate of the defined frame**
