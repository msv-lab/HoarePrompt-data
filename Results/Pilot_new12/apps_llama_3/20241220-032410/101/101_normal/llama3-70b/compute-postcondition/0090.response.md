To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step.

The loop iterates over each pixel in the 2D list `pixels`. For each pixel, it checks if the current position `(i, j)` is on the border of the frame defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`. If it is and the pixel is originally `'.'`, it sets the pixel to `'+'`. If the pixel is `'w'`, it skips to the next iteration. Otherwise, it sets the pixel to `'.'`.

Given the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can infer the following patterns:

- The loop will execute at least once if `n` and `m` are both positive integers.
- After the loop executes, `pixels` will be a 2D list where all pixels on the border of the frame and originally `'.'` are set to `'+'`, and all other pixels that are not `'w'` are set to `'.'`.
- The values of `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged as the loop does not modify them.
- If `m` equals 0, the original state of `pixels` is maintained as the inner loop does not execute.
- `i` and `j` are loop counters and will end at `n-1` and `m-1` respectively after the loop finishes.

Considering these patterns and the loop code, we can determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `pixels` is a 2D list where all pixels on the border of the frame (defined by `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`) and originally `'.'` are set to `'+'`, and all other pixels that are not `'w'` are set to `'.'`.
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of all `'w'` pixels, which does not change during the loop.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels` and do not change.
- `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m` and is calculated based on `max_x`, `min_x`, `max_y`, and `min_y`.
- If the loop does not execute because `n` or `m` is 0, the state of `pixels` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame and originally `'.'` are `'+'` and other non-'w' pixels are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of 'w' pixel coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.**
