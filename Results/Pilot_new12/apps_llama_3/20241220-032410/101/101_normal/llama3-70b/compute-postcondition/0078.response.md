The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` updates the value of `pixels` at the position specified by `i` and `j`. Given that `i` equals 2 and `j` equals 1, the value of `pixels[2][1]` is updated to '+'.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where the value of `pixels[2][1]` is '+', `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[2][1]` equals '+', `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1**
