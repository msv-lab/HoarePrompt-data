Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', if `white_pixels` is not empty then `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels; otherwise, `min_x` is positive infinity, `min_y` is positive infinity, `max_x` is negative infinity, `max_y` is negative infinity. The current value of `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and it is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`.**
