The code assigns `'.'` to `pixels[i][j]`. The value of `i` is 2 and the value of `j` is 0. The previous value of `pixels[i][j]` is not `'.'` and not `'w'`, but the exact previous value is unknown. 

Since `pixels[i][j]` is now `'.'`, and it was not the case that `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j] == '.'`, it is now the case that `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` or `pixels[i][j] == '.'`. 

Given that `pixels[i][j]` is now `'.'`, if `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)`, then `pixels[i][j]` should be `'+'`, but it is now `'.'`, which means it is not the case that `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[1][j]` equals `'+'` if `(1 == min_x or 1 == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and originally `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'`, and `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'` otherwise if `pixels[1][j]` is not `'w'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'`, and it is not the case that `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)`**
