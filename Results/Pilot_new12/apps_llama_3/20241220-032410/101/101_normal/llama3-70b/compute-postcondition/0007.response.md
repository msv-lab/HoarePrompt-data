According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If the list has at least 2 coordinates, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` has at least 1 coordinate, `x` is the x-coordinate of the first white pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the first white pixel, `min_x` equals `x`, `min_y` equals `y`, `max_x` equals `x`, `max_y` equals `y`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 coordinates. The new `x` and `y` should be the coordinates of the second white pixel. The `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` might need to be updated based on the new `x` and `y`, but since we don't know the exact values of the coordinates, we can't determine the exact values of `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`. However, we can say that `min_x` is less than or equal to `x`, `min_y` is less than or equal to `y`, `max_x` is greater than or equal to `x`, `max_y` is greater than or equal to `y`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w' and must have at least 2 coordinates, `x` is the x-coordinate of the second white pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the second white pixel, `min_x` is less than or equal to `x`, `min_y` is less than or equal to `y`, `max_x` is greater than or equal to `x`, `max_y` is greater than or equal to `y`**
