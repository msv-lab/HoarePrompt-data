According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame and initially `'.'` are set to `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, and `j` equals `m`**
