To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the provided program state.

The for loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range of `n`. For this loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer, and `i` must be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 0.

Given the state before the loop starts:

- `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000)
- `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000)
- `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w')
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w'
- If `white_pixels` is not empty, then `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels; otherwise, `min_x` is positive infinity, `min_y` is positive infinity, `max_x` is negative infinity, `max_y` is negative infinity
- `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is indeed a positive integer, and since `i` is the loop variable, it should start from 0, which is the first index in the range of `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and `i` is 0**
