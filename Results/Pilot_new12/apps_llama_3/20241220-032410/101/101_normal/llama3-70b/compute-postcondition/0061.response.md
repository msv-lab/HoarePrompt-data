The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. Since there are no changes made to the variables in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and we move to the next iteration of the loop**
