Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.', 'w', or '+'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', if `white_pixels` is not empty then `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels; otherwise, `min_x` is positive infinity, `min_y` is positive infinity, `max_x` is negative infinity, `max_y` is negative infinity. If `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, the value -1 has been printed and returned. Otherwise, the string representation of each row in `pixels` (where pixels on the border of the frame and originally '.' are '+' and other non-'w' pixels are '.') has been printed.**
