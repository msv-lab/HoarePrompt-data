Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and at least 1, `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The current values of `i` and `j` are such that either `i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y`, and the current value of `pixels` at position `[i][j]` is '.'**
