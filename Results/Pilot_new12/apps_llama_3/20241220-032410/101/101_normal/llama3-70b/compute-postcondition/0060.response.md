The value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'+'`. The previous value of `pixels[i][j]` is unknown, but since `i` is 1 and `j` is 2, and `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, this update assigns `'+'` to the pixel at position `(1, 2)` in the `pixels` frame. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, 
`m` is still a positive integer and must be greater than 2, 
`pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[1][2]` is `'+'`, and pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, 
`white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, 
`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, 
`frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, 
`i` is 1, 
`j` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[1][2]` is `'+'` and pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
