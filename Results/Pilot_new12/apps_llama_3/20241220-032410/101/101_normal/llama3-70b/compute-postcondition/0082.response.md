Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 0, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`, then `pixels[2][1]` equals `'+'`. Otherwise, if `pixels[2][1]` equals `'w'`, the loop continues to the next iteration. In all other cases, `pixels[2][1]` equals `'.'`.**
