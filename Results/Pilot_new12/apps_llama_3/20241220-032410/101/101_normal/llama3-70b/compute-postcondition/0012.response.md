To solve this problem, we first need to understand the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state describes several variables and their properties:

- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive).
- `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 2000 (inclusive).
- `pixels` is a 2D list with `n` sublists, each containing `m` characters that are either '.' or 'w'.
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', and it must contain at least 3 coordinates.
- `x` is the x-coordinate of the third white pixel.
- `y` is the y-coordinate of the third white pixel.
- `min_x` is the minimum of its original value and `x`.
- `min_y` is the minimum of its original value and `y`.
- `max_x` is the maximum of its original value and `x`.
- `max_y` is the maximum of its original value and `y`.

The given Python code snippet updates `max_x` and `max_y` as follows:
```python
max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x), max(max_y, y)
```

This means `max_x` will now be the maximum value between its previous value and `x`, and `max_y` will be the maximum value between its previous value and `y`.

Given this information, the output state after executing the code will be as follows:

- `n` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000).
- `m` remains a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000).
- `pixels` remains a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w').
- `white_pixels` remains a list of coordinates (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and must have at least 3 coordinates.
- `x` remains the x-coordinate of the third white pixel.
- `y` remains the y-coordinate of the third white pixel.
- `min_x` remains the minimum of its original value and `x`.
- `min_y` remains the minimum of its original value and `y`.
- `max_x` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `x`.
- `max_y` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `y`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w' with at least 3 coordinates, `x` is the x-coordinate of the third white pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the third white pixel, `min_x` is the minimum of its original value and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of its original value and `y`, `max_x` is the maximum of its previous value and `x`, `max_y` is the maximum of its previous value and `y`.**
