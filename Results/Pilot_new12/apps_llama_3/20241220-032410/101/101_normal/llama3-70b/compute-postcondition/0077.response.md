To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 2.
- `m` is greater than 0.
- `pixels` is a 2D list with specific initial conditions based on `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and `white_pixels`.
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`.
- `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.
- `i` equals 2.
- `j` equals 0.
- The conditions for `pixels[i][j]` are specified based on its position and value.

The loop statement is `for j in range(m):`. This means the loop will iterate over the range of `m`, starting from 0 up to but not including `m`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is 0.
- For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1 since the loop iterates over the range of `m`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time:
- `j` should be 1 (since it starts at 0 and increments by 1 each iteration).
- The conditions and states of other variables (`n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, `i`) do not directly depend on the loop variable `j` for their existence or initial values within the context of this loop. However, the state of `pixels[i][j]` would depend on the new value of `j` (which is 1) and the conditions specified (whether `i` equals `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `max_y`, and the current value of `pixels[i][j]`).

Considering the dependency on `j` and the specified conditions for `pixels[i][j]`, and given that `i` equals 2 and `j` would be 1 for the next iteration:
- If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` equals `'+'`, otherwise if `pixels[i][j]` equals `'w'`, the loop's behavior is specified, otherwise `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'` and it is not the case that `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)`.

However, without explicit information on how `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and the value of `pixels[2][1]` are updated or depend on the loop, we can only conclude the change in `j` directly from the loop statement.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where the value of `pixels[2][1]` depends on the conditions specified, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1**
