To determine the output state, we need to analyze the impact of the given code on the program.

The code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` by taking the minimum of their current values and `x` and `y`, respectively. 

Since `min_x` initially equals positive infinity and `min_y` initially equals positive infinity, after the update, `min_x` will be `x` (because `x` is less than positive infinity) and `min_y` will be `y` (because `y` is less than positive infinity).

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w' and must have at least 1 coordinate, `x` is the x-coordinate of the first white pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the first white pixel, `min_x` equals `x`, `min_y` equals `y`, `max_x` equals negative infinity, `max_y` equals negative infinity.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w' and must have at least 1 coordinate, `x` is the x-coordinate of the first white pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the first white pixel, `min_x` equals `x`, `min_y` equals `y`, `max_x` equals negative infinity, `max_y` equals negative infinity**
