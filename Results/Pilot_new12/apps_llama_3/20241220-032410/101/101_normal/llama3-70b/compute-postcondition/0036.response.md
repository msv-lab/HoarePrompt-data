The code changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `'+'`. This means the `j-th` element of the `i-th` sublist in `pixels` is now `'+'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and at least 2, `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters and `pixels[i][j]` is '+', `j` is increased by 1, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` remains the same**
