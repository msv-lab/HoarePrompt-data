To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step.

The loop iterates over the range of `m`, which means it will execute `m` times. 

In each iteration, it checks two conditions:

1. If the current position `(i, j)` is on the border of the frame (i.e., `i` equals `min_x` or `max_x` or `j` equals `min_y` or `max_y`) and `pixels[i][j]` equals `'.'`, then `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'+'`.

2. If `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, the loop continues to the next iteration.

3. Otherwise, if neither of the above conditions is true, `pixels[i][j]` is set to `'.'`.

After analyzing these conditions, we can see that the loop will iterate over each column `j` in the frame, and for each position `(i, j)`, it will either set `pixels[i][j]` to `'+'` if it's on the border, or set it to `'.'` if it's not on the border and not `'w'`.

Since `i` is fixed at 1 and `j` ranges from 0 to `m-1`, the loop will only modify the pixels in the row where `i` equals 1.

Considering all possible scenarios:

- If the loop executes, `m` must be greater than 0.
- The original value of `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame are initially set to `'+'`. After the loop, `pixels[1][j]` will be `'+'` if `(1 == min_x or 1 == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and originally `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'`. Otherwise, if `pixels[1][j]` is not `'w'`, it will be set to `'.'`.
- Other variables such as `n`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` do not change during the loop execution.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[1][j]` equals `'+'` if `(1 == min_x or 1 == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and originally `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'`, and `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'` otherwise if `pixels[1][j]` is not `'w'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` equals `m-1`. If `m` equals 0, then the original state of `pixels` is maintained as the loop does not execute.**
