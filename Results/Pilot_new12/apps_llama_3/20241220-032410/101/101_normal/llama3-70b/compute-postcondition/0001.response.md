The input string contains `n` strings with `m` characters each. The first string with `n` and `m` is consumed as input, so the remaining input will be a 2D array of characters, where each character is either '.' or 'w'. 

The code `pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]` creates a 2D list called `pixels` from the input strings. This 2D list has `n` sublists, and each sublist has `m` characters.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), and the input string is consumed.**
