The given code updates the values of `min_x` and `min_y` to be the minimum of their current values and `x` and `y`, respectively. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `x`, `y`, and `max_x` and `max_y` are not affected by this code.

Since `min_x` is less than or equal to `x` and `min_y` is less than or equal to `y`, after the update, `min_x` will be the minimum of its original value and `x`, and `min_y` will be the minimum of its original value and `y`. This means `min_x` will be either its original value or `x`, whichever is smaller, and `min_y` will be either its original value or `y`, whichever is smaller.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), 
`m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), 
`pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), 
`white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w' and must have at least 2 coordinates, 
`x` is the x-coordinate of the second white pixel, 
`y` is the y-coordinate of the second white pixel, 
`min_x` is the minimum of its original value and `x`, 
`min_y` is the minimum of its original value and `y`, 
`max_x` is greater than or equal to `x`, 
`max_y` is greater than or equal to `y`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w' and must have at least 2 coordinates, `x` is the x-coordinate of the second white pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the second white pixel, `min_x` is the minimum of its original value and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of its original value and `y`, `max_x` is greater than or equal to `x`, `max_y` is greater than or equal to `y`**
