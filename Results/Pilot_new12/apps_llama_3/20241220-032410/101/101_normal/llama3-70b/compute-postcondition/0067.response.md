According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `j` equals `m-1`, which means `m` must be greater than 0 for `j` to have a valid value. Also, since `j` is used as an index in the loop, its initial value before the loop should be the first index of the range, which is 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` must be greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[1][j]` equals `'+'` if `(1 == min_x or 1 == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and originally `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'`, and `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'` otherwise if `pixels[1][j]` is not `'w'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
