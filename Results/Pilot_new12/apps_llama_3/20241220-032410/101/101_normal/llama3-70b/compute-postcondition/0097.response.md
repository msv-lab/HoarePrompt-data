To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the patterns observed from the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The loop code is:
```python
for row in pixels:
    print(''.join(row))
```
This loop iterates over each row in the `pixels` 2D list and prints the string representation of each row.

From the given output states, we observe that:

- The number of executions of the loop is equal to the number of rows in `pixels`.
- After each execution, the string representation of the corresponding row in `pixels` has been printed to the console.
- No variables are changed by the code within the loop.

Given this information, we can deduce the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `n` remains a positive integer, unchanged by the loop.
- `m` remains a positive integer, unchanged by the loop.
- `pixels` remains a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame and originally `'.'` are `'+'` and other non-'w' pixels are `'.'`, but its string representation has been printed to the console for each row.
- `white_pixels` remains a list of 'w' pixel coordinates, unchanged by the loop.
- `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` remain defined based on `white_pixels`, unchanged by the loop.
- `frame_size` remains less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, unchanged by the loop.

If `pixels` is empty (i.e., it has no rows), the loop will not execute, and none of the variables will be changed by the loop.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame and originally `'.'` are `'+'` and other non-'w' pixels are `'.'`, the string representation of each row in `pixels` has been printed, `white_pixels` is a list of 'w' pixel coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.**
