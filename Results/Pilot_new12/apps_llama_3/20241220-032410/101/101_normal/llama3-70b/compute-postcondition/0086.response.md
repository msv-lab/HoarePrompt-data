The value of `pixels[i][j]` is updated to `'.'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Since `i` equals 2 and `j` equals 2, `pixels[2][2]` is updated to `'.'`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 1, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 2, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, and `pixels[2][2]` equals `'.'`**
