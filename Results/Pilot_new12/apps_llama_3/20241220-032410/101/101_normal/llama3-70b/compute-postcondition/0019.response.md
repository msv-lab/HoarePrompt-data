According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `m` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and `i` is 0. 

Since the loop iterates over `m`, `j` must be initialized to 0 for the loop to execute. The loop does not depend on `n`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, `frame_size`, or `i`, but these states are still present as they were given in the initial state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and at least 1, `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
