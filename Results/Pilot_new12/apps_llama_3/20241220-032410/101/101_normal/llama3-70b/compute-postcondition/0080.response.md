The code `pixels[i][j] = '.'` changes the value of `pixels[i][j]` to `'.'`. Given the initial state, `i` equals 2 and `j` equals 1, so `pixels[2][1]` is updated to `'.'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where `pixels[2][1]` equals `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 1**
