Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer and must be greater than 2, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame are `'+'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. If `pixels[1][2]` is `'w'`, we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, `pixels[1][2]` is `'.'`.***
