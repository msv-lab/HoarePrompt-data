Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer and at least 2, `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is '+', and `j` is increased by 1, `i` remains the same. If `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j]` is not '.', or if `(i!= min_x and i!= max_x and j!= min_y and j!= max_y)`, then if `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', `j` is increased by 1. If `pixels[i][j]` is not 'w' and `(i!= min_x and i!= max_x and j!= min_y and j!= max_y)`, or if `pixels[i][j]` is not '.' and `(i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[i][j]` is not '.', then `pixels[i][j]` is '.', and `j` remains the same, and `i` remains the same. `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.***
