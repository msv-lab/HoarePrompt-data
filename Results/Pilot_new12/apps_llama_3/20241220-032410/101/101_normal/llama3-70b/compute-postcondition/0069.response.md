The code `pixels[i][j] = '+'` assigns the value `'+'` to the element at position `[i][j]` in the `pixels` 2D list. The previous value of `pixels[i][j]` was `'.'`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is still greater than 0, `white_pixels` is still a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are still defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is still less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and `i` and `j` still equal 2 and 0 respectively, and the condition that either `i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y` still holds. 

The value of `pixels[1][j]` is still `'+'` if `(1 == min_x or 1 == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `'.'` otherwise if `pixels[1][j]` is not `'w'`. The only change is that `pixels[i][j]` is now `'+'`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 0, `pixels` is a 2D list where originally `pixels[1][j]` equals `'+'` if `(1 == min_x or 1 == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y)` and `pixels[1][j]` equals `'.'` otherwise if `pixels[1][j]` is not `'w'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 0, `pixels[i][j]` equals `'+'`, and the current values of `i` and `j` are such that either `i` is equal to `min_x` or `i` is equal to `max_x` or `j` is equal to `min_y` or `j` is equal to `max_y`.**
