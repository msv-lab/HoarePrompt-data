The code initializes four variables: `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, and `max_y`. These variables are assigned the values of positive infinity, positive infinity, negative infinity, and negative infinity respectively.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
So `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), and `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w'. 
`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are initialized but not updated based on any other variables.
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), 
`m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), 
`pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), 
`white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w', 
`min_x` equals positive infinity, 
`min_y` equals positive infinity, 
`max_x` equals negative infinity, 
`max_y` equals negative infinity.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists, where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.' or 'w'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where pixels[i][j] is 'w', `min_x` equals positive infinity, `min_y` equals positive infinity, `max_x` equals negative infinity, `max_y` equals negative infinity**
