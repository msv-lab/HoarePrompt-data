According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 2, but since `m` is greater than 0 and can be any positive integer, `m` being greater than 2 does meet this requirement but is more restrictive than needed, it is sufficient for `m` to be greater than 1. Other variables `n`, `i`, `frame_size`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are not directly related to the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `m` is greater than 1, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 2, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`.**
