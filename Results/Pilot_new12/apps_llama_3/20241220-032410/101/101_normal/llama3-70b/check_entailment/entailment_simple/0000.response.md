Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input, which includes the resolution of the monitor (`n` and `m`) and the state of the pixels (`.` for black and `w` for white).

2. **White Pixel Detection**: It accurately identifies the coordinates of all white pixels on the screen and calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates (`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`) among these white pixels. This step is crucial for determining the size and position of the potential frame.

3. **Frame Size Calculation**: The program calculates the size of the frame that would encompass all white pixels. It does this by finding the maximum difference between `max_x` and `min_x` and between `max_y` and `min_y`, and then adding 1. This ensures that the frame is large enough to include all white pixels on its border.

4. **Frame Existence Check**: If the calculated frame size exceeds the dimensions of the monitor (`n` or `m`), the program correctly prints `-1`, indicating that no frame can exist within the monitor's boundaries that meets the given conditions.

5. **Frame Rendering**: For frames that can exist within the monitor's boundaries, the program marks the border pixels of the frame with `+`, replacing any original `.` characters, while leaving `w` characters unchanged. This effectively draws the smallest possible frame that includes all white pixels on its border.

6. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the resulting monitor screen, with the frame drawn around the white pixels, if such a frame can exist.

The program's logic follows the problem description closely, handling all specified conditions and constraints. It calculates the frame size correctly, checks for the frame's feasibility, and outputs the modified screen accordingly. Therefore, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
