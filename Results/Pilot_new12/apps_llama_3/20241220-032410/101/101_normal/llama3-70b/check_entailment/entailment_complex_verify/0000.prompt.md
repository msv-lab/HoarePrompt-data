You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program provided accurately implements the game rules and logic to solve the problem. It takes the monitor resolution as input, along with the state of the pixels, and determines the possible square frame with the smallest size that satisfies all the given conditions. The program correctly identifies the white pixels, calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, and uses these to determine the frame size and position. 

The program also handles cases where no frame can be drawn that meets the conditions (i.e., when the frame size exceeds the monitor's dimensions) by printing -1. The loop that replaces the required pixels with '+' signs correctly follows the border of the calculated frame, leaving the white pixels unchanged.

The provided examples illustrate how the program functions correctly for different scenarios, including when the frame size is 1 (i.e., a single white pixel is present) and when no frame can be drawn to meet the conditions (in which case -1 is printed). 

After reviewing the code and testing it with various inputs, no cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input to the function is a list of strings, where the first string contains two positive integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000) separated by a space, representing the resolution of the monitor. The next n strings contain exactly m characters each, where each character is either '.' (period, ASCII code 46) representing a black pixel or 'w' (lowercase English letter w) representing a white pixel.

    frame_size = max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1
    if (frame_size > max(n, m)) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i == min_x or i == max_x or j == min_y or j == max_y) and pixels[i][j

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `pixels` is a 2D list where pixels on the border of the frame and originally `'.'` are `'+'` and other non-'w' pixels are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of 'w' pixel coordinates, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` are defined based on `white_pixels`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 2000), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 2000), `pixels` is a 2D list containing `n` sublists where each sublist is a list of `m` characters ('.', 'w', or '+'), `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates (i, j) where `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', if `white_pixels` is not empty then `min_x` is the minimum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `min_y` is the minimum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_x` is the maximum x-coordinate of all 'w' pixels, `max_y` is the maximum y-coordinate of all 'w' pixels; otherwise, `min_x` is positive infinity, `min_y` is positive infinity, `max_x` is negative infinity, `max_y` is negative infinity. If `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`, the value -1 has been printed and returned. Otherwise, the string representation of each row in `pixels` (where pixels on the border of the frame and originally '.' are '+' and other non-'w' pixels are '.') has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes input from the user representing a monitor resolution and pixel data, processes the pixel data to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, and then prints the modified pixel data with a border around the white pixels if the frame size is within the monitor resolution, or prints -1 if the frame size exceeds the monitor resolution. The function does not explicitly return any value but affects the state of the program by printing the modified pixel data or an error message. The input to the function is assumed to be a list of strings where the first string contains two positive integers separated by a space, and the subsequent strings contain pixel data. The function handles edge cases where the frame size is larger than the monitor resolution and where there are no white pixels, resulting in the printing of -1 or an empty frame, respectively. The function also modifies the original pixel data by replacing black pixels on the border of the frame with '+' and leaving other black pixels unchanged.
