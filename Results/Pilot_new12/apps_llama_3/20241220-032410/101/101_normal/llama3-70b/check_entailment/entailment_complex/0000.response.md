Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. 

One case where it fails to meet the requirements is when there are multiple possible frames that satisfy the conditions, but the program only prints one of them. The problem description states that if there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, we should print any of them. However, the current implementation always prints the frame with the top-left corner at the minimum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, which may not be the only possible solution.

Another issue is that the program does not check if all white pixels are located on the frame. It only checks if the frame size is within the monitor resolution and if the frame is a square. But it does not verify that all white pixels are indeed on the border of the frame.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input pixels contain 'w' characters that are not on the border of the frame. The problem description states that all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame, but the program does not check for this condition.

Finally, the program does not find the smallest possible frame that satisfies the conditions. It simply calculates the size of the frame based on the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, without considering other possible frames that may be smaller. 

To fix these issues, the program would need to be modified to check for all possible frames, verify that all white pixels are on the frame, handle cases where the input pixels contain 'w' characters that are not on the border of the frame, and find the smallest possible frame that satisfies the conditions. 

Here's an example of how the program could be modified to address these issues:
```python
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    pixels = [list(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    white_pixels = [(i, j) for i in range(n) for j in range(m) if pixels[i][j] == 'w']
    min_frame_size = float('inf')
    best_frame = None

    for frame_size in range(1, max(n, m) + 1):
        for x in range(n - frame_size + 1):
            for y in range(m - frame_size + 1):
                frame = [(i, j) for i in range(x, x + frame_size) for j in range(y, y + frame_size) if (i == x or i == x + frame_size - 1 or j == y or j == y + frame_size - 1)]
                if all(pixel in frame for pixel in white_pixels) and frame_size < min_frame_size:
                    min_frame_size = frame_size
                    best_frame = (x, y, frame_size)

    if best_frame:
        x, y, frame_size = best_frame
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(m):
                if (i >= x and i < x + frame_size and (i == x or i == x + frame_size - 1 or j == y or j == y + frame_size - 1)) and pixels[i][j] == '.':
                    pixels[i][j] = '+'
                elif pixels[i][j] == 'w':
                    continue
                else:
                    pixels[i][j] = '.'
        for row in pixels:
            print(''.join(row))
    else:
        print(-1)
```
This modified program checks for all possible frames, verifies that all white pixels are on the frame, and finds the smallest possible frame that satisfies the conditions.
