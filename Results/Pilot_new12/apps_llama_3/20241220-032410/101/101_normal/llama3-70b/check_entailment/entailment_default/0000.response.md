Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

The main issue with the code is that it does not correctly identify the smallest possible square frame that includes all white pixels and has a width of one pixel. 

The code finds the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels and then calculates the frame size based on these coordinates. However, this approach does not guarantee that the frame is a square, which is a requirement of the problem description.

For example, if the input is a rectangle with white pixels on the top and bottom edges but not on the sides, the code will still draw a frame that is a rectangle, not a square. 

Additionally, the code does not handle cases where the minimum possible frame is a single pixel (1x1 square), it simply draws the frame based on the minimum and maximum coordinates of the white pixels.

Another issue is that the code does not check if the calculated frame size is indeed a square that can fit within the monitor resolution. It only checks if the frame size is larger than the maximum of the monitor's width and height, which is not sufficient to guarantee that the frame is a square.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified to correctly identify the smallest possible square frame that includes all white pixels and has a width of one pixel, and to handle cases where the minimum possible frame is a single pixel or a square that cannot fit within the monitor resolution. 

One possible way to do this is to iterate over all possible square sizes, starting from 1, and check if a square of that size can be placed within the monitor resolution such that it includes all white pixels. The first square size that meets this condition is the minimum possible frame size. 

However, the provided code does not implement this approach and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
