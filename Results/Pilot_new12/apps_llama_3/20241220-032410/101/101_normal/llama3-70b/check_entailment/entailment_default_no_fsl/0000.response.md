Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all the cases as described in the problem. One of the key issues is that the program does not correctly calculate the frame size and does not check if all white pixels are on the frame. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2 6
w..w.w
...w..
```
The program outputs:
```
-1
```
However, a more detailed examination shows that the issue is not just with the frame size exceeding the monitor resolution. The problem description asks for the smallest possible square frame that can contain all the white pixels. In this case, the program does not correctly identify that a square frame of size 1 is not possible and it does not correctly explore other possible frames.

Another issue is that the program does not correctly draw the frame around the white pixels. It only checks if a pixel is on the border of the frame and if it is black, it replaces it with a '+'. However, this approach does not guarantee that the frame is a square and that all white pixels are on the frame.

The program description requires a more sophisticated approach to find the smallest possible square frame that can contain all the white pixels and to correctly draw the frame around the white pixels. The current implementation does not meet these requirements, so the correctness of the program is False.
