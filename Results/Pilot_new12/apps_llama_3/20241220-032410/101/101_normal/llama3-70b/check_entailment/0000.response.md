Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program provided accurately implements the game rules and logic to solve the problem. It takes the monitor resolution as input, along with the state of the pixels, and determines the possible square frame with the smallest size that satisfies all the given conditions. The program correctly identifies the white pixels, calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, and uses these to determine the frame size and position. 

The program also handles cases where no frame can be drawn that meets the conditions (i.e., when the frame size exceeds the monitor's dimensions) by printing -1. The loop that replaces the required pixels with '+' signs correctly follows the border of the calculated frame, leaving the white pixels unchanged.

The provided examples illustrate how the program functions correctly for different scenarios, including when the frame size is 1 (i.e., a single white pixel is present) and when no frame can be drawn to meet the conditions (in which case -1 is printed). 

After reviewing the code and testing it with various inputs, no cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
