The function takes input from the user representing a monitor resolution and pixel data, processes the pixel data to find the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates of the white pixels, and then prints the modified pixel data with a border around the white pixels if the frame size is within the monitor resolution, or prints -1 if the frame size exceeds the monitor resolution. The function does not explicitly return any value but affects the state of the program by printing the modified pixel data or an error message. The input to the function is assumed to be a list of strings where the first string contains two positive integers separated by a space, and the subsequent strings contain pixel data. The function handles edge cases where the frame size is larger than the monitor resolution and where there are no white pixels, resulting in the printing of -1 or an empty frame, respectively. The function also modifies the original pixel data by replacing black pixels on the border of the frame with '+' and leaving other black pixels unchanged.
