Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem described. Specifically, the issue arises when the program attempts to find the minimum size square frame that encompasses all the white pixels. The current implementation finds the minimum and maximum row and column indices where 'w' is found, but it does not verify whether the resulting frame is a square or not. 

For example, if the input is:
```
4 5
....w
.....
.....
w....
```
The program will return:
```
....+
....+
....+
w...+
```
Instead of correctly identifying that there is no square frame of size 1 or greater that satisfies the conditions. 

Additionally, the current implementation only checks if the frame height or width is less than 2, but it does not check if the frame is actually a square. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is False.
