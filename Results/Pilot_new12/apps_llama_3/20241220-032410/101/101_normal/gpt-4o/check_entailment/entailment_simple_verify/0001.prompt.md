You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Innocentius has a problem — his computer monitor has broken. Now some of the pixels are "dead", that is, they are always black. As consequence, Innocentius can't play the usual computer games. He is recently playing the following game with his younger brother Polycarpus.

Innocentius is touch-typing a program that paints a white square one-pixel wide frame on the black screen. As the monitor is broken, some pixels that should be white remain black. Polycarpus should look at what the program displayed on the screen and guess the position and size of the frame Innocentius has painted. Polycarpus doesn't like the game but Innocentius persuaded brother to play as "the game is good for the imagination and attention".

Help Polycarpus, automatize his part in the gaming process. Write the code that finds such possible square frame that:  the frame's width is 1 pixel,  the frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen,  all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame,  of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size. 

Formally, a square frame is represented by such pixels of the solid square, that are on the square's border, that is, are not fully surrounded by the other pixels of the square. For example, if the frame's size is d = 3, then it consists of 8 pixels, if its size is d = 2, then it contains 4 pixels and if d = 1, then the frame is reduced to a single pixel.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers n, m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000). The next n lines contain exactly m characters each — the state of the monitor pixels at the moment of the game. Character "." (period, ASCII code 46) corresponds to the black pixel, and character "w" (lowercase English letter w) corresponds to the white pixel. It is guaranteed that at least one pixel of the monitor is white.


-----Output-----

Print the monitor screen. Represent the sought frame by characters "+" (the "plus" character). The pixels that has become white during the game mustn't be changed. Print them as "w". If there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size, print any of them.

If the required frame doesn't exist, then print a single line containing number -1.

                        left = j

                        right = j
    if top is None or bottom is None or left is None or (right is None):
        return -1
    frame_height = bottom - top + 1
    frame_width = right - left + 1
    if frame_height < 2 or frame_width < 2:
        return -1
    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
    for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or (j == right):

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly identifies the top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the white pixels on the screen and then draws a frame around them using the "+" character.

The program handles the edge cases where the frame's width or height is less than 2, in which case it returns -1 as per the problem description. It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple white pixels scattered across the screen and draws the smallest possible frame that encloses all of them.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. It iterates over the screen to find the boundaries of the white pixels, and then it constructs the result by drawing a frame around these boundaries. The use of the top, bottom, left, and right variables to keep track of the boundaries of the white pixels is a good approach, and the program correctly updates these variables as it iterates over the screen.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input screen is empty or where there are no white pixels, as it returns -1 in these cases.

Overall, the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs. It correctly implements the problem description and handles all edge cases. 

One thing to note is that this program assumes that the input will always be in the correct format, i.e., the first line will always contain two integers separated by a space, and the subsequent lines will always contain strings of the correct length. If the input is not in the correct format, the program may not work correctly. However, this is not a problem with the program itself, but rather with the input validation. 

The examples given in the problem description all work correctly with this program, and I couldn't find any other cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
screen = [input().strip() for _ in range(n)]

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
