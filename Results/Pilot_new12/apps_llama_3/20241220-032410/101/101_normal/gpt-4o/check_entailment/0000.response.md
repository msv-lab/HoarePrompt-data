Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly implement the problem description. One potential case that the program does not handle correctly is when the frame's width or height is 1 pixel. In such cases, the program should return the original screen with all white pixels marked as "w", but instead, it incorrectly returns -1.

For example, if the input is:
```
2 4
....
.w..
```
The program should return the original screen, but it incorrectly returns -1. The correct output should be:
```
....
.w..
```
This is because the problem statement specifies that the frame's width is 1 pixel, and all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame. In this case, the frame is a single row or column of width 1, and the white pixel is already on the frame.

Another case that the program does not handle correctly is when there are multiple possible ways to position the frame of the minimum size. The program should print any of them, but it may not always find the smallest possible frame.

The program also does not check if the frame goes beyond the borders of the screen. It should return -1 if the frame does not satisfy this condition, but it may not always do so.

Finally, the program does not handle the case when the required frame does not exist correctly. It should return -1 in such cases, but it may not always do so.

Therefore, the program is not correct, and its correctness is **False**.
