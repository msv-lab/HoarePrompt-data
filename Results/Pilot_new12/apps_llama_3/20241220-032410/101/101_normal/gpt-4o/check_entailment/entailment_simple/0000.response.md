Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description and correctly identifies the smallest possible square frame that can be drawn on the screen, where all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Finding the bounding box of white pixels**: The program first finds the minimum and maximum row and column indices where 'w' is found. This creates a bounding box around all white pixels on the screen.

2. **Checking for a valid frame**: The program checks if the frame height and width are both greater than or equal to 2. If not, it returns -1, indicating that a valid frame cannot be drawn.

3. **Drawing the frame**: The program then draws the frame by replacing all border pixels that were initially '.' with '+'. The rest of the pixels remain the same as in the original screen.

4. **Returning the result**: Finally, the program returns the resulting 2D list, which represents the screen with the drawn frame.

The program correctly implements the problem description because:

* It finds the smallest possible square frame that can be drawn on the screen by using the bounding box of white pixels.
* It checks for a valid frame and returns -1 if the frame height or width is less than 2.
* It correctly draws the frame by replacing border pixels with '+' and leaving the rest of the pixels unchanged.
* It returns the resulting 2D list, which represents the screen with the drawn frame.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly identifies and draws the smallest possible square frame on the screen.
