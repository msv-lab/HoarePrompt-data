Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly identifies the top, bottom, left, and right boundaries of the white pixels on the screen and then draws a frame around them using the "+" character.

The program handles the edge cases where the frame's width or height is less than 2, in which case it returns -1 as per the problem description. It also correctly handles the case where there are multiple white pixels scattered across the screen and draws the smallest possible frame that encloses all of them.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly implements the problem description. It iterates over the screen to find the boundaries of the white pixels, and then it constructs the result by drawing a frame around these boundaries. The use of the top, bottom, left, and right variables to keep track of the boundaries of the white pixels is a good approach, and the program correctly updates these variables as it iterates over the screen.

The program also correctly handles the case where the input screen is empty or where there are no white pixels, as it returns -1 in these cases.

Overall, the program is correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs. It correctly implements the problem description and handles all edge cases. 

One thing to note is that this program assumes that the input will always be in the correct format, i.e., the first line will always contain two integers separated by a space, and the subsequent lines will always contain strings of the correct length. If the input is not in the correct format, the program may not work correctly. However, this is not a problem with the program itself, but rather with the input validation. 

The examples given in the problem description all work correctly with this program, and I couldn't find any other cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
