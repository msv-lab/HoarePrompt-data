Correctness: **False**

The code seems to be incorrect and does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` finds the minimum and maximum row and column indices where 'w' is found in the `screen`, and then creates a frame around these indices. However, it does not find the smallest possible square frame that contains all the white pixels.

One case where the program does not work correctly is when there are multiple possible square frames of the same minimum size that can contain all the white pixels. In this case, the program will return the first frame it finds, which may not be the correct one.

Another case is when the white pixels form a square shape, but the program does not correctly identify the square frame. For example, if the input is:

```
4 4
.....
.w.w.
.w.w.
.....
```

The output should be:

```
.....
+w.w+
+w.w+
.....
```

But the program might return a different output.

The output hints do not provide enough information to guarantee that the code works correctly in all cases, and the examples provided do not cover all possible scenarios. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the code is correct for every potential case. 

A correct solution would involve checking all possible square frames of the same minimum size and returning the one that contains all the white pixels. The code does not seem to implement this logic, which is why it is considered incorrect. 

A more correct solution would involve implementing a loop to try all possible sizes of the square frame, starting from the smallest size, and checking if all white pixels are on the frame. If they are, then that frame is the solution. If not, the loop should continue with the next larger size until it finds a frame that satisfies the conditions or until it checks all possible sizes. 

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    min_row, max_row, min_col, max_col = float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                min_row, max_row = min(min_row, i), max(max_row, i)
                min_col, max_col = min(min_col, j), max(max_col, j)
    
    size = max(max_row - min_row, max_col - min_col) + 1
    
    for frame_size in range(size, n + m + 1):
        for row in range(n - frame_size + 1):
            for col in range(m - frame_size + 1):
                frame = [[0]*frame_size for _ in range(frame_size)]
                for i in range(frame_size):
                    for j in range(frame_size):
                        if i == 0 or i == frame_size - 1 or j == 0 or j == frame_size - 1:
                            if row + i < n and col + j < m and screen[row + i][col + j] == 'w':
                                frame[i][j] = 1
                if all(frame[i][j] == 1 or (row + i >= n or col + j >= m or screen[row + i][col + j]!= 'w') 
                       for i in range(frame_size) 
                       for j in range(frame_size) 
                       if i == 0 or i == frame_size - 1 or j == 0 or j == frame_size - 1):
                    result = [list(row) for row in screen]
                    for i in range(frame_size):
                        for j in range(frame_size):
                            if i == 0 or i == frame_size - 1 or j == 0 or j == frame_size - 1:
                                if row + i < n and col + j < m and result[row + i][col + j] == '.':
                                    result[row + i][col + j] = '+'
                    return result
    return -1
```
This corrected solution first finds the minimum size of the square frame and then checks all possible frames of that size to find the one that contains all the white pixels. If it does not find such a frame, it increases the size and checks again, until it finds a frame that satisfies the conditions or until it checks all possible sizes.
