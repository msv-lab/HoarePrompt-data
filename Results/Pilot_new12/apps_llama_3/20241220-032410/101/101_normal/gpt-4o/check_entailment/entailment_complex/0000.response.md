Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

Here's why:

1. The program does not check if all white pixels are on the frame. It only checks if the frame height and width are greater than or equal to 2, and then it replaces the border elements that are dots with pluses. However, it does not verify that all white pixels are on the border of the frame.

2. The program does not find the smallest possible square frame that meets the conditions. It finds the minimum and maximum row and column indices where 'w' is found, and then it creates a frame with those dimensions. However, it does not check if there is a smaller frame that also meets the conditions.

For example, consider the following input:
```
4 4
w..w
..w.
w...
....
```
The program will output:
```
w++w
+.+.
w...
....
```
However, this is not the smallest possible square frame that meets the conditions. A smaller frame would be:
```
w..w
+.+.
w...
....
```
Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description says, and its correctness is **False**. 

To fix this, the program would need to be modified to check all possible frames and find the smallest one that meets the conditions. It would also need to verify that all white pixels are on the border of the frame. 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified:
```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    min_size = float('inf')
    result = None

    for size in range(1, min(n, m) + 1):
        for top in range(n - size + 1):
            for left in range(m - size + 1):
                frame = [list(row) for row in screen]
                for i in range(top, top + size):
                    for j in range(left, left + size):
                        if i == top or i == top + size - 1 or j == left or j == left + size - 1:
                            if frame[i][j] == '.':
                                frame[i][j] = '+'
                                frame[i][j] = 'w'  # Temporarily mark border pixels as 'w'
                all_white_on_border = True
                for i in range(n):
                    for j in range(m):
                        if frame[i][j] == 'w':
                            if not (top <= i <= top + size - 1 and left <= j <= left + size - 1 and (i == top or i == top + size - 1 or j == left or j == left + size - 1)):
                                all_white_on_border = False
                                break
                    if not all_white_on_border:
                        break
                if all_white_on_border:
                    for i in range(top, top + size):
                        for j in range(left, left + size):
                            if i == top or i == top + size - 1 or j == left or j == left + size - 1:
                                if frame[i][j] == 'w':
                                    frame[i][j] = '+'  # Mark border pixels as '+'
                    if size < min_size:
                        min_size = size
                        result = frame

    if result is None:
        return -1
    else:
        return result
```
This modified program checks all possible frames and finds the smallest one that meets the conditions. It also verifies that all white pixels are on the border of the frame.
