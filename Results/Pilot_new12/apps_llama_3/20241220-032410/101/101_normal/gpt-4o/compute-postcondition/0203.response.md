To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(top, bottom + 1):
    for j in range(left, right + 1):
        if i == top or i == bottom or j == left or j == right:
            if result[i][j] == '.':
                result[i][j] = '+'
```
This loop iterates over the rows and columns of the `result` 2D list, which is a copy of the `screen`. The loop checks for elements on the border (i.e., the first row `top`, the last row `bottom`, the first column `left`, and the last column `right`) and replaces any dots (`'.'`) with pluses (`'+'`).

The output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times provide insights into how the variables change. However, the key information is in the loop code itself.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `result` 2D list will have all its border elements that were initially dots replaced with pluses, and the rest of the elements will remain the same as in `screen`. The variables `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` will retain their original values, as the loop does not modify them.

The loop will execute if `top` is less than or equal to `bottom` and `left` is less than or equal to `right`, which is already guaranteed by the given conditions (`frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2 and `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2).

If the loop does not execute (which is not possible given the conditions but considering a hypothetical scenario where `top` is greater than `bottom` or `left` is greater than `right`), the variables would retain their original values, and `result` would remain a copy of `screen` without any modifications.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left + 1`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, and `result` is a 2D list where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, and the rest of the elements are the same as `screen`.**
