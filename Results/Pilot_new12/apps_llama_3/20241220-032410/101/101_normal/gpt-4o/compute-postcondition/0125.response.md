To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `m` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is `n-1`.
   - `bottom` is either less than or equal to `i`, which is `n-1`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code assigns the value of `j` to a new variable named `left`. Since `j` is 1, `left` is assigned the value 1.

3. **Output State Determination**:
   - The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `j`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment of `j` to `left`.
   - `left` is assigned the value of `j`, which is 1.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `m` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `j` is 1.
   - If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is `n-1`.
   - `bottom` is either less than or equal to `i`, which is `n-1`.
   - `left` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 1, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is either less than or equal to `i` which is `n-1`, and `left` is 1**
