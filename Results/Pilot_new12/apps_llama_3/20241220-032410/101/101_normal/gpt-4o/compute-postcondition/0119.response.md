The code assigns `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. Since `i` is `n-1`, `top` and `bottom` are also assigned `n-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 1, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`**
