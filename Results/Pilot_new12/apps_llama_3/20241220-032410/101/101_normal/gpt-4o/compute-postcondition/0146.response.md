Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. The variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are related to the indices where 'w' is found in `screen`: `top` is the minimum row index, `bottom` is the maximum row index, `left` is the minimum column index, and `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found. Currently, at least one of the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, or `right` is `None`, meaning that either 'w' has not been found in `screen` or its indices have not been fully determined.**
