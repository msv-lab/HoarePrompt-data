Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `j` equals 1, `left` equals 1, and the other variables retain their initial values: if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` equals `n`, `bottom` equals `n`, and if `n` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `n`. If `j` is not less than `left`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` equals 1, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` equals `n`, `bottom` equals `n`, and if `n` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `n`.**
