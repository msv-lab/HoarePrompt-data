Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `j` is 0, and the values of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are updated based on the current index `i` and `j`. Specifically, if `top` is `None`, then `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are set to `n-1`, `n-1`, 0, and 0 respectively. Otherwise, `top` remains less than or equal to `i`, `bottom` is updated to `n-1` if `i` is greater than the original `bottom`, and `right` is updated to `j` if `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', then the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `j` remain unchanged, with `j` being 0.***
