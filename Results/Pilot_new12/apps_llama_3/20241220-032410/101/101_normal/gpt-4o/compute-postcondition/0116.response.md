Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `top` is `None`, then `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0. Otherwise, `top` is less than or equal to `i`, if `i` is greater than the original `bottom`, then `bottom` is `n-1`, otherwise `bottom` remains the maximum row index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row. If `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`, with `j` being the current value of `right` when `j` is less than or equal to the maximum column index where 'w' is found. Otherwise, `left`, `right`, and `j` retain their original values based on the indices where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row, with `j` being 0.**
