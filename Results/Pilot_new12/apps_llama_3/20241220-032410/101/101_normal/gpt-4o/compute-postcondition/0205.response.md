The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` and `m`, which are positive integers, and `screen`, which is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of characters "." and "w". The function returns a value based on certain conditions. 

Case_1: The function returns -1. 
Case_2: The function returns -1. 
Case_3: The function returns a 2D list `result` where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, and the rest of the elements are the same as the initial `screen`, with a frame of height `bottom - top + 1` and width `right - left + 1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `screen` of strings of length `m`, and return either -1 or a modified 2D list based on the conditions specified.
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers n and m, and a 2D list screen of strings of length m, and returns either -1 or a modified 2D list where border elements are replaced with pluses and the rest remain the same as the initial screen.**
