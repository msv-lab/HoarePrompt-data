Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is 0, `right` is the index of the last 'w' in the first row, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, and `bottom` and `top` are updated based on their previous values and `n`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains as described in the precondition, with `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `left` is the index of the first 'w' in the first row, `right` is the index of the last 'w' in the first row, and `bottom` and `top` are updated based on their previous values and `n`.**
