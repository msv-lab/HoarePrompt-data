The code `bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. The previous value of `bottom` was `None`, and the current value of `i` is greater than the previous value of `bottom`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0, the value of `m` remains a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` remains a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` remains 0, and the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` remains 'w'. 

If `i` is less than the original value of `top`, then the current value of `top` remains 0. Otherwise, the current value of `top` retains its original value unless it was less than `i`. The value of `left` and `right` remain `None`.

The value of `bottom` is now equal to `i`, and since `i` is greater than the original value of `bottom` (which was `None`), the new value of `bottom` is `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w', if `i` is less than the original value of `top`, then the current value of `top` is 0, otherwise `top` retains its original value unless it was less than `i`, `left` and `right` are `None`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, and `i` is greater than or equal to `bottom`.**
