The value of `right` is updated to be equal to `j`. The previous value of `right` was the maximum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, if `i` is less than `top`, then the current value of `top` is `n-1`, otherwise the current value of `top` is less than or equal to `i`, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is `n-1`, otherwise the current value of `bottom` remains the maximum row index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`. If `j` is less than the minimum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row, then the current value of `left` is 0, the current value of `right` is `j`, and the current value of `j` is greater than `j`, which means the previous condition for `j` being less than the minimum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row is now invalid. The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w' when `j` is less than or equal to the maximum column index where 'w' is found, which now equals `j`. Otherwise, the current values of `left`, `right`, and `j` retain their original values based on the indices where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row, with the current value of `j` being greater than the current value of `right` which is now equal to `j`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, if `i` is less than `top`, then the current value of `top` is `n-1`, otherwise the current value of `top` is less than or equal to `i`, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is `n-1`, otherwise the current value of `bottom` remains the maximum row index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`. The current value of `left` retains its original value based on the indices where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row, `right` is `j`, `j` is greater than the previous value of `right` and now equals the current value of `right`, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w' when `j` is less than or equal to the maximum column index where 'w' is found.**
