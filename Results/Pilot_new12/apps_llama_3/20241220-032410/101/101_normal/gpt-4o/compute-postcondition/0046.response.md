Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `top` is `None`, then `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `m`, and `right` is `m`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is equal to `j`; if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is `m` and `j` is `m`; if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is `i`; and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`. In all other cases, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `j` being `m`.**
