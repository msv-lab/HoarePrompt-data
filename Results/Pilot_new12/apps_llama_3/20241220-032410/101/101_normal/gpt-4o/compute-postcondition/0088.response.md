The value of `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `i` is less than `top`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `top` is equal to `i`, and `bottom` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `top` is equal to `i`**
