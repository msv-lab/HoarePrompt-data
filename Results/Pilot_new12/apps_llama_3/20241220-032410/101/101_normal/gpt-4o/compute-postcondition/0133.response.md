The code `left = right = j` simultaneously assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given that `j` is 2, both `left` and `right` will be assigned the value 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 2, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is 2, `right` is 2**
