Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w'. `j` is greater than `right`, `j` is 0, `left` and `right` are `None` unless `j` was previously less than `left` in which case `left` is 0 and `right` is not None, `top` is 0 if `i` is less than the original value of `top`, otherwise `top` retains its original value unless it was less than `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i` if `i` is greater than the original value of `bottom`, otherwise `bottom` retains its original value.**
