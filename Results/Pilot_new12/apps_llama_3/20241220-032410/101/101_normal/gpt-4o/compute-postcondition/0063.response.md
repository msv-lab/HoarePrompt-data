The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to `left`. The previous value of `left` was the index of the first 'w' in the first row, but this information is no longer valid for `left`. The value of `j` is 0, so `left` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `left` is 0, `right` is the index of the last 'w' in the first row, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, if `i` is greater than a previous value of `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is `n`, and if `n` is less than a previous value of `top`, then the current value of `top` is `n`.**
