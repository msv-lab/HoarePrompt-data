Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is `i` and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`. If `i` is not greater than `bottom`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `n` and `m` being positive integers greater than 0, `screen` being a 2D list of strings of length `m`, and `j` being `m`.***
