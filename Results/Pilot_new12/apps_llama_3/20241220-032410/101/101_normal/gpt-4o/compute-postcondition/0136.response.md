To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `m` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`
- `j` is 2
- if `n-1` is less than `top`, then `i` is `n-1` and `top` is `n-1`, otherwise, no change is made to `i`

The code is: 
```python
bottom = i
```

The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. Given the conditions in the initial state, `i` can be either `n-1` (if `n-1` is less than `top`) or an unspecified value (if `n-1` is not less than `top`). 

Since `bottom` is assigned the value of `i`, and considering the conditions for `i`, `bottom` will be `n-1` if `n-1` is less than `top`, otherwise, `bottom` will have the same value as `i`, which is not specified in the initial state but is known to be not changed if `n-1` is not less than `top`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `m` is a positive integer greater than 1
- `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`
- `j` is 2
- if `n-1` is less than `top`, then `i` is `n-1`, `top` is `n-1`, and `bottom` is `n-1`
- otherwise, `i` and `bottom` have the same unspecified value, and `top` is greater than or equal to `n-1`

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is 2, if `n-1` is less than `top`, then `i` is `n-1`, `top` is `n-1`, and `bottom` is `n-1`, otherwise, `i` and `bottom` have an unspecified value and `top` is greater than or equal to `n-1`**
