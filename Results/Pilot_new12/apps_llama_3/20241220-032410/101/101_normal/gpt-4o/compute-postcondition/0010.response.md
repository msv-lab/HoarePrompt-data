Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w'. If `i` is less than the original value of `top`, then `top` is 0. Otherwise, the state of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remains unchanged, with `bottom`, `left`, and `right` being None and `top` retaining its original value unless it was less than `i`.***
