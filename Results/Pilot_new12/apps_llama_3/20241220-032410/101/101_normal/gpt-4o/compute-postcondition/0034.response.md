Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then the state of the variables `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` is updated based on the current values of `i` and `j`: if `top` is `None`, then `j` is `m`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `m`, and `right` is `m`; otherwise, `right` is updated to `j` if `j` is greater than `right`, `left` is updated to `j` if `j` is less than `left` and `j` is not `m`, `bottom` is updated to `i` if `i` is greater than `bottom`, and `top` is updated to `i` if `i` is less than `top`. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
