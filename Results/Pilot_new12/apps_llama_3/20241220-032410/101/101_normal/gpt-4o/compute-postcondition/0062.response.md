Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `left` is the index of the first 'w' in the first row, `right` is the index of the last 'w' in the first row, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, if `i` is greater than a previous value of `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is `n`, and if `n` is less than a previous value of `top`, then the current value of `top` is `n`. The current value of `j` is less than the current value of `left`.**
