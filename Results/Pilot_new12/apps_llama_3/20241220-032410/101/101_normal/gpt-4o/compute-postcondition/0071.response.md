The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. The initial state specifies that `i` is equal to `n`. 

Therefore, `top` and `bottom` are both assigned the value of `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `top` is `n`, `bottom` is `n`**
