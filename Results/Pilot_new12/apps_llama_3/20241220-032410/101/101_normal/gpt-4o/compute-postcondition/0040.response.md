The code assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged, so `n` is still a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`, and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`, `bottom` is `i`, and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`**
