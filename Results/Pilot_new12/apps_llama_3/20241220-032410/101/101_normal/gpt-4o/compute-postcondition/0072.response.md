The code introduces two new variables, `left` and `right`, and assigns them the value of `j`, which is 1. The values of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `top` is `n`, `bottom` is `n`, `left` is 1, `right` is 1**
