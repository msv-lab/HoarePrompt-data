To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given that the loop statement is `for j in range(m):`, this means that the loop will iterate over the range of `m`, where `m` is a positive integer greater than 1. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must increment by 1.

So, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be 2. 

Since the loop body is not provided and the state adjustments depend on the values of `screen[i][j]`, we cannot definitively adjust `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` without knowing the value of `screen[i][j]` for the new `j`. However, we can state the conditions under which these variables might change.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 2**
