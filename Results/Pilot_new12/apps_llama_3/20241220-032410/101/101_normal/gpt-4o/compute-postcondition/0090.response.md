The code assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `i`, `bottom`, `top`, and `j` are not affected by this operation, except that the value of `j` is now also stored in `left`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `left` is equal to `j`, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is equal to `i`, if `i` is less than `top`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `top` is equal to `i`**
