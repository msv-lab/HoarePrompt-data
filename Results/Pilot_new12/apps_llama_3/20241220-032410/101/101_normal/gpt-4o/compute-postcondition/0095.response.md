Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then the state of the variables is updated based on the conditions: if `top` is None, then `j` is incremented by 1, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, and `left` is equal to `right` is equal to `j`. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is equal to `j`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is equal to `j`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is equal to `i`. If `i` is less than `top`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `top` is equal to `i`. If none of these conditions are met, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
