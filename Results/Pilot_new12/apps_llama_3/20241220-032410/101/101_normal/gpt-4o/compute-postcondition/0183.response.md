Since `j` is `right + 1`, it is out of the bounds of the `result` and `screen` lists because `right` is the maximum valid index. However, the given statement attempts to assign a value to `result[i][j]`. This action will result in an "IndexError: list assignment index out of range" exception because `j` exceeds the valid indices for `result` and `screen`. 

However, we must determine the output state based on the information given. Given the information and the attempt to execute the given code, the state of the variables before the attempted assignment remains the same because the assignment operation does not take place due to the index error.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left + 1`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 3, `result` is a 2D list where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, and for any element at index `[i][j]` in `result`, if the element was initially a dot and `i` is equal to `top` or `i` is equal to `bottom` or `j` is equal to `left` or `j` is equal to `right`, it is replaced with a plus, and the rest of the elements are the same as `screen` except for the changed elements, `j` is `right + 1`, an IndexError occurs because `j` is out of bounds for `result`.**
