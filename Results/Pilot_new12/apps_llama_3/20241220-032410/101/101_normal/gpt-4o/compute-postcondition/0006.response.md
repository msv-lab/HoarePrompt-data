The code `left = right = j` updates the values of `left` and `right` to be equal to the current value of `j`. Given the initial state, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w'**
