The code replaces the current dot element at position `result[i][j]` with a plus. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the value of `result[i][j]` is now a plus, and the rest of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 2`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 3, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a 2D list where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, and the element at `[i][j]` is now a plus, `i` is either `top` or `bottom`, `j` is either `left` or `right`**
