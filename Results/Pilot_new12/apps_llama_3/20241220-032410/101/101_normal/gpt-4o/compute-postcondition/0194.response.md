To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(left, right + 1):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range from `left` to `right` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is either `left` or `right`, or `j` is at a position where an operation has been performed on the `result` 2D list.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. Given that the loop iterates over the range from `left` to `right`, for `j` to have a valid next value within this range, it must currently be less than `right`.

Thus, considering the conditions and the loop statement:

- `n` remains a positive integer, as it doesn't directly influence the loop's iteration.
- `m` remains a positive integer, as it's not directly involved in the loop's condition.
- `screen` remains unchanged, as it's not modified by the loop's iteration condition.
- `top` and `bottom` remain sets, with `bottom` being greater than or equal to `top + 2`, as these conditions are not affected by the loop.
- `left` remains set, as it's the starting point of the range and doesn't change.
- `right` remains set and greater than or equal to `left`, as the loop iterates up to this point.
- `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and remains greater than or equal to 3, unaffected by the loop.
- `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and remains greater than or equal to 2, as the loop's range is defined by `left` and `right`.
- `result` is a 2D list where border elements that were initially dots have been replaced with pluses. Its state at specific positions `[i][j]` has been modified according to the operations performed in the loop body.
- `i` can be `top`, `bottom`, or `top + 2`, depending on the context not fully specified by the loop statement alone, but it's not directly influenced by the loop over `j`.
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1 from its current value for the loop to execute again. Since `j` is in the range from `left` to `right`, and we're considering the next iteration, `j` must be less than `right` for the loop to continue.

Given these considerations, the state adjustments for the loop to execute one more time are centered around `j` and the implications of its increment on the `result` and related variables.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 2`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 3, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a 2D list where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, `i` is either `top` or `bottom` or `i` is `top + 2`, and `j` is the next integer value in the range from `left` to `right`, starting from the current value of `j` plus one, if the element at `[i][j]` in `result` was a dot, it is now a plus, otherwise the state of `result` at `[i][j]` remains unchanged.**
