The given code snippet assigns the string '+' to the element at position [i][j] in the 2D list `result`. 

The value of `i` is not explicitly defined in the given initial state, so it is assumed to be some integer index. 

The value of `j` is defined as `left + 2`, and `left` is a set value, so `j` equals `left + 2`.

The state of the other variables are not affected, so `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than `left + 1`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `j` equals `left + 2`. 

`result` is a 2D list where the element at position [i][j] is '+', and the rest of the elements are unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than `left + 1`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `j` equals `left + 2`, `result` is a 2D list where the element at position [i][j] is '+'**
