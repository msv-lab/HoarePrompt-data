Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, if `result[i][j]` equals '.', then `result` is a copy of `screen` except that `result[i][j]` equals '+', and the current value of `i` is either equal to `top` or equal to `bottom`, and the current value of `j` is either equal to `left` or equal to `right`.***
