Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w', `j` is 0. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `left` is `None`, `right` is 0, `top` is 0 if `i` is less than the original value of `top`, otherwise `top` retains its original value unless it was less than `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i` if `i` is greater than the original value of `bottom`, otherwise `bottom` retains its original value. If `j` is not greater than `right`, then `left` and `right` are `None`, `top` and `bottom` retain their original values unless `i` is less than the original value of `top` then `top` is 0, or if `i` is greater than `bottom` then `bottom` is `i`.***
