The code `bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. Given the initial state, `i` is `n`. 

So, `bottom` becomes `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `left` is the index of the first 'w' in the first row, `right` is the index of the last 'w' in the first row, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `top` is either its previous value or `n` (if `n` is less than its previous value), and `bottom` is `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `left` is the index of the first 'w' in the first row, `right` is the index of the last 'w' in the first row, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, if `n` is less than a previous value of `top`, then `top` is `n`, otherwise `top` remains unchanged, and `bottom` is `n`**
