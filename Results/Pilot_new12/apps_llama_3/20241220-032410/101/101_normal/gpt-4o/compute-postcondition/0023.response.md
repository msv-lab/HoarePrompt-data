The code assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. The initial state does not specify the value of `i`, but it does specify the values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, and `j`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we can only express `top` and `bottom` in terms of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`**
