The code `left = right = j` assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given that `j` is equal to `m`, `left` and `right` will both be assigned the value of `m`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `m`, and `right` is `m`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `m`, and `right` is `m`.**
