To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for i in range(n):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n`, `top` is the minimum row index where 'w' is found in the `n`-th row or `None`, `bottom` is the maximum row index where 'w' is found in the `n`-th row or `None`, `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found in the `n`-th row or `None`, `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found in the `n`-th row or `None`.

However, since `i` is already `n`, the loop cannot execute again with the current values of `n` and `i`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be less than `n`. 

Since `i` is increased by 1 at each iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, it should have executed one less time, which means `i` should be `n-1` at the end of the previous iteration. 

But we are given `i` is `n`, so we need to decrease `i` by 1 and also decrease `n` by 1 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `top` is the minimum row index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`, `bottom` is the maximum row index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`, `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`, `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`**
