Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `left` is the index of the first 'w' in the first row, `right` is the index of the last 'w' in the first row. The current value of `i` is `n` and `j` is 0. If `i` is less than a previous value of `top`, then the current value of `top` is `n` and the current value of `bottom` is 0, otherwise the current values of `top` and `bottom` remain unchanged. Additionally, the current value of `i` is greater than the current value of `bottom`.**
