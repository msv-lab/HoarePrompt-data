Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `j` is less than `left`, then the current value of `left` is 0 and the current value of `right` is the index of the last 'w' in the first row. Otherwise, the current value of `left` is the index of the first 'w' in the first row and the current value of `right` is the index of the last 'w' in the first row. The current value of `i` is `n`, the current value of `j` is 0, and `bottom` and `top` are updated based on their previous values and `n`. Additionally, the current value of `j` is greater than the current value of `right`.**
