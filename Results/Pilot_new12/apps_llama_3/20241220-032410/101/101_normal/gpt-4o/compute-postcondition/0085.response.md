The code `left = right = j` assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The previous values of `left` and `right` are unknown, but after this assignment, both `left` and `right` will have the same value as `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is incremented by 1, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `top` is equal to `bottom`, `left` is equal to `j`, and `right` is equal to `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is incremented by 1, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `top` is equal to `bottom`, `left` is equal to `j`, and `right` is equal to `j`.**
