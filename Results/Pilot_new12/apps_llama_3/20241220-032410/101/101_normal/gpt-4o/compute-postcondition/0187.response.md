According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `top`, and `bottom`. If `i` is less than `bottom + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `top + 1`, `bottom` is greater than or equal to `top + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` should be increased by 1. So, `i` becomes `top + 2`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 2`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 3, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a 2D list where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, and the rest of the elements are the same as `screen`, `i` is `top + 2`**
