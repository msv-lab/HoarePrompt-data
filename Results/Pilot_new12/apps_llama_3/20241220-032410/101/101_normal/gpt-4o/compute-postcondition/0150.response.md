The value of `frame_width` is assigned the value of `right - left + 1`. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, and `frame_height` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is the minimum row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the maximum row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1`, and all of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is the minimum row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the maximum row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1`, and all of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`**
