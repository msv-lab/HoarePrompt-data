The code `bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to `bottom`. Given that `i` equals `n`, `bottom` will be equal to `n`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals `n`, `j` equals 1, `bottom` equals `n`, and if `n` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals `n`, `j` equals 1, `bottom` equals `n`, and if `n` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `n`.**
