Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `j` equals 1, `left` equals 1, and the other variables retain their initial values. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` equals `n`, `bottom` equals `n`, and if `n` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `n`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `j` equals 1, `right` equals 1, `left` equals 1, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` equals `n`, `bottom` equals `n`, and if `n` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `n`. If `j` is not greater than `right`, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition.**
