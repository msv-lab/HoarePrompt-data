The code `top = bottom = i` assigns the value of `i` to both `top` and `bottom`. The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`. 

Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, `top` and `bottom` are assigned an undefined value `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`**
