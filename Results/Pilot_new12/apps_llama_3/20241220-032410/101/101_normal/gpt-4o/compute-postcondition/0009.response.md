The value of `top` is updated to be equal to the current value of `i`. The current value of `i` is 0, so `top` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is 0, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w'**
