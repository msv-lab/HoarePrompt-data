Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w'. If `i` is less than the original value of `top`, then the current value of `top` is 0. Otherwise, the current value of `top` is its original value unless it was less than `i`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is equal to `i`. `left` and `right` are not None, and the current value of `j` is less than the current value of `left`.**
