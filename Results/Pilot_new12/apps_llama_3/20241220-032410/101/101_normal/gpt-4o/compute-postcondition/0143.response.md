Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is 2. If `screen[n-1][2]` is 'w', then if `top` is `None`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is 2, `right` is 2, and `i` is `n-1`. If `top` is not `None`, then if `j` is less than `left`, `left` is 2. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i`, `top`, and `bottom` are all set to `n-1` if `n-1` is less than `top`, otherwise `i` and `bottom` have an unspecified value and `top` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If `i` is not greater than `bottom` and `j` is less than `left`, no changes are made to `i`, `top`, or `bottom`. If `j` is greater than `right`, no additional changes are made beyond those already specified. If `screen[n-1][2]` is not 'w', then the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
