Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `screen[i][j]` is 'w'. If `top` is `None`, then `top` is `n`, `bottom` is `n`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0. Otherwise, if `j` is greater than `right`, then `j` is 0 and `right` is `j`, otherwise `left` is the index of the first 'w' in the first row, `right` is the index of the last 'w' in the first row, and `bottom` and `top` are updated based on their previous values and `n`.***
