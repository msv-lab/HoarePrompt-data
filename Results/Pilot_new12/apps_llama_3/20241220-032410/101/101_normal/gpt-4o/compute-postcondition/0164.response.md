Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left + 1`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `j` equals `left + 1`, if `result[i][j]` is '.', then `result` is a 2D list where the element at index `[i][left + 1]` is `'+'` and the rest of the elements are the same as `screen`, otherwise `result` remains unchanged**
