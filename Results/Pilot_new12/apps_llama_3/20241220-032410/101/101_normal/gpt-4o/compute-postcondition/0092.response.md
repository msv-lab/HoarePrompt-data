The value of `right` is assigned the value of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is equal to `j`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is equal to `i`. If `i` is less than `top`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `top` is equal to `i`. If `j` is not less than `left`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged. `right` is equal to `j`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `right` is equal to `j`. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is equal to `j`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is equal to `i`. If `i` is less than `top`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `top` is equal to `i`. If `j` is not less than `left`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
