Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `screen[i][j]` equals 'w', then the bounds are updated as follows: if `top` is `None`, then `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is `m`, and `right` is `m`. Otherwise, `right` is updated to `j` if `j` is greater than `right`, `left` is updated to `j` if `j` is less than `left`, `bottom` is updated to `i` if `i` is greater than `bottom`, and `top` is updated to `i` if `i` is less than `top`. In all cases, `j` is `m`. If `screen[i][j]` does not equal 'w', the state of the variables remains unchanged with `j` being `m`.**
