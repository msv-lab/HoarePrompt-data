The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to `left`. Given that `j` is 0, `left` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w'. If `i` is less than the original value of `top`, then the current value of `top` is 0. Otherwise, the current value of `top` is its original value unless it was less than `i`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is equal to `i`. `right` is not None, and the current value of `j` is less than or equal to the current value of `left` which is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w', `left` is 0, if `i` is less than the original value of `top`, then the current value of `top` is 0, otherwise, the current value of `top` is its original value unless it was less than `i`, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is equal to `i`, `right` is not None**
