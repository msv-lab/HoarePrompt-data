To calculate the result, we first need to understand the initial state and the impact of the given code. 

The initial state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is the minimum row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the maximum row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found, and `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found, and all of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`.

Now, let's look at the code: `frame_height = bottom - top + 1`. 

This code calculates the height of a frame based on the minimum and maximum row indices where 'w' is found. 

Given that `top` and `bottom` are the minimum and maximum row indices where 'w' is found, the `frame_height` is equal to `bottom - top + 1`. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not changed by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is the minimum row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the maximum row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found, `frame_height` is `bottom - top + 1`, and all of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is the minimum row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the maximum row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1`, and all of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`**
