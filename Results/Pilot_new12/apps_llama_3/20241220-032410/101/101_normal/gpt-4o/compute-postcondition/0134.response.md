The variable `top` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` is `n-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 2, `top` is `n-1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 2, `top` is `n-1`**
