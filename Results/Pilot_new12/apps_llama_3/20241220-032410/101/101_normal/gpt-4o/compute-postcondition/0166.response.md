To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to continue. The loop is defined as `for j in range(left, right + 1):`, which means it will iterate over the range from `left` to `right` (inclusive). 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` equals `left + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be incremented by 1, making it `left + 2`. Since `right` is greater than or equal to `left + 1`, if we increment `j` to `left + 2`, it is still less than or equal to `right` if `right` is greater than `left + 1`. Therefore, the condition for the loop to execute again is that `right` must be greater than `left + 1`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer,
- `m` is a positive integer,
- `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`,
- `top` is set,
- `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`,
- `left` is set,
- `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left + 1`,
- `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2,
- `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2,
- `j` equals `left + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we adjust the state as follows:
- `j` should be incremented to `left + 2`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than `left + 1`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `j` equals `left + 2`**
