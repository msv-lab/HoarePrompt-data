The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Since `j` is 1, both `left` and `right` become 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 1, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is 1, `right` is 1**
