Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is equal to `j`. Additionally, if `j` is less than `left`, then `j` is `m` and `left` is `m`, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is `i` and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
