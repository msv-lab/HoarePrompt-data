The code initializes four variables: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`, and assigns `None` to each of them. The initial state of `n`, `m`, and `screen` remains unchanged as the code does not modify them. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of characters "." and "w", `top` is None, `bottom` is None, `left` is None, `right` is None**
