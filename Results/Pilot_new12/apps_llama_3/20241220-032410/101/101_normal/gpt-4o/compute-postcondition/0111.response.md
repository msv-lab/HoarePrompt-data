To determine the output state after the given Python code is executed based on the initial state provided, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables and their relationships.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `m` is a positive integer.
- `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`.
- `i` is `n-1`.
- If `i` is less than `top`, then the current value of `top` is `n-1`, otherwise `top` is less than or equal to `i`.
- If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is `n-1`, otherwise `bottom` remains the maximum row index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`.
- `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`.
- `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`.
- `j` is 0.
- The current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.
- The current value of `j` is less than the current value of `left`.

The code to be executed is:
```python
left = j
```

The impact of this code is that it assigns the value of `j` to `left`. Given that `j` is 0 and `j` is less than the current value of `left`, after execution, `left` will be 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, if `i` is less than `top`, then the current value of `top` is `n-1`, otherwise `top` is less than or equal to `i`, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is `n-1`, otherwise `bottom` remains the maximum row index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`, `left` is 0, `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**.
