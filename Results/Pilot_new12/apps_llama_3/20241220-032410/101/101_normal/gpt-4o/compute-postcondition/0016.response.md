Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w'. If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is 0, `right` is not None, if `i` is less than the original value of `top`, then `top` is 0, otherwise, `top` retains its original value unless it was less than `i`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is equal to `i`. Otherwise, `left` and `right` are `None`, `top` and `bottom` retain their original values***
