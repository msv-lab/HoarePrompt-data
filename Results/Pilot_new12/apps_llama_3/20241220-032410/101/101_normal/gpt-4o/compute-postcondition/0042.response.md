The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to `left`. Given the initial state, `j` is equal to `m`. 

So, `left` is assigned the value of `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`, `left` is `m`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is `i` and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`, `left` is `m`, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is `i` and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`.**
