Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `top` and `bottom` are updated to `n` if they were `None`, and `left` and `right` are updated based on the index of the first and last 'w' in the row. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', then the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` keeping their previous values, which depend on whether any 'w' was found in the first row of `screen`.**
