The code `left = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `left`. The value of `j` is given as 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is 2, `left` is 2. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i`, `top`, and `bottom` are all set to `n-1` if `n-1` is less than `top`, otherwise `i` and `bottom` have an unspecified value and `top` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If `i` is not greater than `bottom`, no changes are made to `i`, `top`, or `bottom`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is 2, `left` is 2, If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i`, `top`, and `bottom` are all set to `n-1` if `n-1` is less than `top`, otherwise `i` and `bottom` have an unspecified value and `top` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If `i` is not greater than `bottom`, no changes are made to `i`, `top`, or `bottom`.**
