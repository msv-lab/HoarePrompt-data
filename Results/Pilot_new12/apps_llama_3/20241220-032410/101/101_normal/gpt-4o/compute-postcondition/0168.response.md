Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than `left + 1`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `j` equals `left + 2`, if `result[i][j]` was '.', then `result` is a 2D list where the element at position [i][j] is '+', otherwise `result` remains unchanged***
