Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `top` is None, then `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `top` is `n`, `bottom` is `n`, `left` is 1, and `right` is 1. Otherwise, if `j` is less than `left`, then `j` equals 1 and `left` equals 1; if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` equals `n`, `bottom` equals `n`, and if `n` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `n`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `j` equals 1, `right` equals 1, `left` equals 1, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` equals `n`, `bottom` equals `n`, and if `n` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `n`. If none of these conditions are met, the state of the variables remains unchanged from the precondition, with `i` equals `n` and `j` equals 1.***
