You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers, and screen is a 2D list of strings of length m, where each string consists of characters "." and "w", representing the state of the monitor pixels, with at least one "w" present in the screen.
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None

    return result
    #The program returns a 2D list `result` where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, and the rest of the elements are the same as the initial `screen`, with a frame of height `bottom - top + 1` and width `right - left + 1`, where `bottom` is greater than or equal to `top + 1` and `right` is greater than or equal to `left + 1`.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two positive integers n and m, and a 2D list screen of strings of length m, and returns either -1 or a modified 2D list where border elements are replaced with pluses and the rest remain the same as the initial screen.

```

Return Postconditions: Case_1: The program returns -1

Case_2: The program returns -1

Case_3: The program returns a 2D list `result` where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, and the rest of the elements are the same as the initial `screen`, with a frame of height `bottom - top + 1` and width `right - left + 1`, where `bottom` is greater than or equal to `top + 1` and `right` is greater than or equal to `left + 1`.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
