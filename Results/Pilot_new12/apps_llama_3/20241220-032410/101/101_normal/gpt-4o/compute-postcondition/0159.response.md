The given code changes the value of `result[i][j]` from '.' to '+'. The values of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still a positive integer, `m` is still a positive integer, `screen` is still a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is still set, `bottom` is still set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is still set, `right` is still set and greater than or equal to `left`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is still greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is still greater than or equal to 2. 
The current value of `i` is either equal to `top` or equal to `bottom`, and the current value of `j` is either equal to `left` or equal to `right`. The current value of `result[i][j]` is now '+'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a copy of `screen` except that `result[i][j]` equals '+', the current value of `i` is either equal to `top` or equal to `bottom`, and the current value of `j` is either equal to `left` or equal to `right`.**
