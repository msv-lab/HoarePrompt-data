According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must have been `m-1` for the loop to have executed previously. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`**
