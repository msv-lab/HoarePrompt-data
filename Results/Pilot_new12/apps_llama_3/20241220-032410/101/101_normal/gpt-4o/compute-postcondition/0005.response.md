The code `top = bottom = i` updates the values of `top` and `bottom` to be equal to the current value of `i`. Since the initial value of `i` is 0, both `top` and `bottom` become 0. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is None, `right` is None, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w'**
