The code `top = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `top`. Given that `i` is `n`, the value of `top` becomes `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1, `top` is `n`**
