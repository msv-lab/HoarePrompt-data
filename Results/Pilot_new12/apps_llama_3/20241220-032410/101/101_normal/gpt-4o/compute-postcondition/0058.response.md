Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `left` is the index of the first 'w' in the first row, `right` is the index of the last 'w' in the first row, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is `n` and `bottom` is 0, otherwise `top` and `bottom` remain unchanged***
