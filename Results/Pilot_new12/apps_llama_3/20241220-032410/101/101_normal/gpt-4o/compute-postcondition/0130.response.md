Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 1. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then if `top` is `None`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is 1, and `right` is 1. Otherwise, `left` is 1, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is less than or equal to `n-1`, and if `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is 1, otherwise `right` remains unchanged. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
