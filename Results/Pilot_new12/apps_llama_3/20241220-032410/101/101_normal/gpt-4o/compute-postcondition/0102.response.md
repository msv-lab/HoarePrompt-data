The code updates the values of `left` and `right` to be equal to `j`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'.
