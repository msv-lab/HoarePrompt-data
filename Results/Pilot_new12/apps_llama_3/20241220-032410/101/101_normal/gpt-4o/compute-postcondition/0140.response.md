The code `right = j` assigns the value of `j` to the variable `right`. Since `j` is 2, `right` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is 2, `right` is 2, If `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is 2, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i`, `top`, and `bottom` are all set to `n-1` if `n-1` is less than `top`, otherwise `i` and `bottom` have an unspecified value and `top` is greater than or equal to `n-1`. If `i` is not greater than `bottom` and `j` is less than `left`, no changes are made to `i`, `top`, or `bottom`. If `j` is not less than `left`, no changes are made to `i`, `top`, or `bottom` because there is no else part to handle this case.**
