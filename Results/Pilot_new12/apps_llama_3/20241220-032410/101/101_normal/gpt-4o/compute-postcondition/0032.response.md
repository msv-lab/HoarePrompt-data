Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is updated to `j`. Additionally, the following conditions hold: if `j` is less than `left`, then `j` is `m` and `left` is `m`; if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to `i`; and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`. If `j` is not greater than `right`, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
