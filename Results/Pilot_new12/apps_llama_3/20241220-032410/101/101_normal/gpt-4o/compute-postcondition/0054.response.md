The code `left = right = j` updates the values of `left` and `right` to be equal to `j`. Given the initial state, `j` is 0. 

So, `left` is updated to 0 and `right` is also updated to 0.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is `n`, `bottom` is `n`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0, `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is `n`, `bottom` is `n`, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0**
