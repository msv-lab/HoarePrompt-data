The value of `top` is assigned the value of `i`. However, the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, so we can only conclude that `top` is now equal to `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`, `top` is equal to `i`**
