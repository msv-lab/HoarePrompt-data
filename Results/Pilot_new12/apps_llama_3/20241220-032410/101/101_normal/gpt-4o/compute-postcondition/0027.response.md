The code assigns the value of `i` to the variable `bottom`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `j`, and the relation between `i` and `top` are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`, `bottom` is `i`, and if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is equal to `i`.**
