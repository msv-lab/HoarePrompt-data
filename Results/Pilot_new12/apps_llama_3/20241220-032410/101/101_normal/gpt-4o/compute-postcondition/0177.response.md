Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a 2D list where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, and the rest of the elements are the same as `screen`. If `i` is equal to `top` or `i` is equal to `bottom` or `j` is equal to `left` or `j` is equal to `right`, then the corresponding element in `result` is replaced with a plus if it was initially a dot.**
