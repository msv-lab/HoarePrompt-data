According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, and we need to consider the state of `j`. Since the loop iterates over `range(m)`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. If `j` was `m-1` at the end of the last iteration, then for the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than the current value of `m`, which is not possible. However, if we consider the loop can execute one more time if `j` is less than `m-1`, we need to increment `j` to `j+1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is incremented by 1**
