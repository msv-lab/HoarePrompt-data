Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `j` is 1, `left` is 1, `top` is `n-1`, and `bottom` is either less than or equal to `n-1`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `right` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `right`.**
