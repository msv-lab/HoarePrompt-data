The value of `right` is updated to `j`. Since `j` is 0, `right` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, the current value of `screen` at position `[i][j]` is 'w', `j` is 0, `left` is `None`, `right` is 0, `top` is 0 if `i` is less than the original value of `top`, otherwise `top` retains its original value unless it was less than `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i` if `i` is greater than the original value of `bottom`, otherwise `bottom` retains its original value**
