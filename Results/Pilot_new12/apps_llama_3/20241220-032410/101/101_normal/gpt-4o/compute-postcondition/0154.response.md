The code creates a new 2D list `result` which is a copy of the `screen`. The `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `frame_height`, and `frame_width` are not changed by this code. A new variable `result` is introduced which is a copy of `screen`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is the minimum row index where 'w' is found, `bottom` is the maximum row index where 'w' is found, `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found, `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1`, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1`, `result` is a copy of `screen` which is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, and all of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`. The `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2 and the `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.**
