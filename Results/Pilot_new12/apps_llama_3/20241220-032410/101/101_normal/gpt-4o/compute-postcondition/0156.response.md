According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `right` is greater than or equal to `left`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `right` is greater than or equal to `left` and `j` is equal to `left`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a copy of `screen`, `i` is `top`, `j` is `left`**
