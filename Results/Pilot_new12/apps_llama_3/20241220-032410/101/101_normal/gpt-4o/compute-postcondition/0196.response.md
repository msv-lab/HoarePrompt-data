Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 2`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 3, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a 2D list where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, and if the element at `[i][j]` in `result` was a dot, it is now a plus, otherwise the state of `result` at `[i][j]` remains unchanged, `i` is either `top` or `bottom` or `i` is `top + 2`, and `j` is the next integer value in the range from `left` to `right`.***
