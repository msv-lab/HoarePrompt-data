To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the provided state before the loop starts.

The loop statement is: `for i in range(top, bottom + 1):`

This indicates that the loop will iterate over a range of values from `top` to `bottom` (inclusive), which means `i` will take on the values of `top`, `top + 1`,..., `bottom`.

Given the state before the loop starts:

- `n` and `m` are positive integers.
- `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`.
- `top` is the minimum row index where 'w' is found.
- `bottom` is the maximum row index where 'w' is found.
- `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found.
- `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found.
- `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1`.
- `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1`.
- `result` is a copy of `screen` which is a 2D list of strings of length `m`.
- All of `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are not `None`.
- The `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2 and the `frame_width` is greater than or equal to 2.

For the loop to execute, it must be true that `bottom` is greater than or equal to `top` because the `range()` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value, unless the stop value is explicitly made inclusive by adding 1, which is the case here (`bottom + 1`). However, for the loop to have at least one iteration, `top` must be less than or equal to `bottom`.

Given that `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and `frame_height` is greater than or equal to 2, it implies that `bottom - top + 1 >= 2`, which simplifies to `bottom - top >= 1` or `bottom >= top + 1`. This condition ensures that there is at least one iteration of the loop (since `bottom` is at least `top + 1`, making the range non-empty).

The conditions and variables provided ensure that the loop can indeed execute. For the loop to start, `i` needs to be initialized to `top`, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a copy of `screen`, `i` is `top`**
