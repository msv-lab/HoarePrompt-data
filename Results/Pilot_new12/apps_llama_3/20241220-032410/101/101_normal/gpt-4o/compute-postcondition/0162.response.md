According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `left`, and `right`. If `j` is less than `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be equal to `left` since the loop has just started, but for the next iteration to occur, `j` must be increased by 1. Since `j` has been increased by 1, `j` must now be less than or equal to `right` for the loop to continue. However, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `right`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left + 1`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a copy of `screen`, `j` equals `left + 1`**
