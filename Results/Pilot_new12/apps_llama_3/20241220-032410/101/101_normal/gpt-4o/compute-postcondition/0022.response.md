According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m` and the current value of `j`. If `j` is less than `m-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` must be `m-1` for the loop to have executed at least once. For the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than the current value of `j` plus 1, so `m` must be greater than `m-1` plus 1, which is not possible since `j` is `m-1`. However, considering the context of the problem, it seems that `j` should be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, the new value of `j` should be `m`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `j` is `m`**
