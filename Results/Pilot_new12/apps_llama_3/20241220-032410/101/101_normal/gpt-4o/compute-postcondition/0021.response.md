Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 0, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`. If `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `j` is 0 and the following conditions apply: if `top` is `None`, then `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 0. Otherwise, `top` retains its original value unless `i` is less than the original value of `top`, then `top` is 0, or if `i` is greater than the original value of `bottom`, then `bottom` is `i`. If `j` is greater than the original value of `right`, then `left` is `None`, `right` is 0. If `j` is not greater than `right`, then `left` and `right` are `None`. If `screen[i][j]` is not 'w', then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
