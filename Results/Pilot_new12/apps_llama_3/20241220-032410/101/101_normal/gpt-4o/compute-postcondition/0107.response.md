Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, if `i` is less than `top`, then the current value of `top` is `n-1`, otherwise the current value of `top` is less than or equal to `i`, `bottom` is the maximum row index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`, `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`, `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', and the current value of `i` is greater than the current value of `bottom`**
