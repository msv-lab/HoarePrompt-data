According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 1**
