Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, if `i` is less than `top`, then the current value of `top` is `n-1`, otherwise the current value of `top` is less than or equal to `i`, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then the current value of `bottom` is `n-1`, otherwise the current value of `bottom` remains the maximum row index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`. If `j` is less than the minimum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row, then the current value of `left` is 0, the current value of `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`, and the current value of `j` is 0. Otherwise, the current values of `left`, `right`, and `j` retain their original values based on the indices where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row, with the current value of `j` being 0 and the current value of `screen[i][j]` being 'w`. The current value of `j` is greater than the current value of `right`.**
