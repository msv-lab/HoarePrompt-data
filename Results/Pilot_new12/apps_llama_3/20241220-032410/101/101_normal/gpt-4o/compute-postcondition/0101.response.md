The code updates the values of `top` and `bottom` to be equal to `i`. The previous value of `i` is `n-1`. 

Therefore, the new values of `top` and `bottom` are `n-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, `top` is `n-1`, `bottom` is `n-1`, `left` is the minimum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`, `right` is the maximum column index where 'w' is found in the `(n-1)`-th row or `None`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
