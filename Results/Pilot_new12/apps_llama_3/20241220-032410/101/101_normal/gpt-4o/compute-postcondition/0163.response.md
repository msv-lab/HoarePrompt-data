The value of `result[i][j]` is updated to `'+'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`result` is a 2D list where the element at index `[i][j]` is `'+'`, and the rest of the elements are the same as `screen`. 

Since `j` equals `left + 1`, `result[i][left + 1]` equals `'+'`. 

The value of `i` is not specified, but `i` must be within the range of the list `result` (or `screen`), so `i` is between `0` and `n-1` (inclusive) and also `top` is less than or equal to `i` and `i` is less than or equal to `bottom`, because `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1`. 

The Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`m` is a positive integer, 
`screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, 
`top` is set, 
`bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, 
`left` is set, 
`right` is set and greater than or equal to `left + 1`, 
`frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, 
`frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, 
`result` is a 2D list where the element at index `[i][left + 1]` is `'+'` and the rest of the elements are the same as `screen`, 
`j` equals `left + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left + 1`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a 2D list where the element at index `[i][left + 1]` is `'+'` and the rest of the elements are the same as `screen`, `j` equals `left + 1`**
