The given code changes the value of a single element in the `result` 2D list to '+'. 

The initial state specifies that `result` is a 2D list where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, and the rest of the elements are the same as `screen`. After executing the given code, the value at index `[i][j]` in the `result` list is set to '+'.

Since `i` and `j` are not specified in the problem, their values are unknown. However, it can be inferred that the specified element in the `result` list will be '+', regardless of its initial value.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a positive integer, `m` is still a positive integer, `screen` is still a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is still set, `bottom` is still set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is still set, `right` is still set and greater than or equal to `left + 1`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left + 1`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 3, `result` is a 2D list where all border elements that were initially dots are replaced with pluses, the element at index `[i][j]` is '+', and the rest of the elements are the same as `screen` except for the changed element.**
