Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `top` is set, `bottom` is set and greater than or equal to `top + 1`, `left` is set, `right` is set and greater than or equal to `left`, `frame_height` equals `bottom - top + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `frame_width` equals `right - left + 1` and is greater than or equal to 2, `result` is a copy of `screen`, if `i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right` and `result[i][j]` equals '.', then `result[i][j]` equals '+', otherwise `result` remains unchanged***
