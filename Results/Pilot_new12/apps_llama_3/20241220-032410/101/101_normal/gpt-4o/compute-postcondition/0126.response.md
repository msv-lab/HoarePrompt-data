Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a 2D list of strings of length `m`, `i` is `n-1`, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is 1, otherwise no changes are made, and `j` is 1, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is `n-1`, and `bottom` is either less than or equal to `i` which is `n-1`***
