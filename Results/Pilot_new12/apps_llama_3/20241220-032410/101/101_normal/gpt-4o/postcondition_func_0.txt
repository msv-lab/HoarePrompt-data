The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `screen` of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of characters "." and "w". It returns either -1 or a modified 2D list. The function finds the minimum and maximum row and column indices where 'w' is found in the `screen`. If any of these indices are not found or if the frame height or width (defined by the difference between the maximum and minimum indices plus one) is less than 2, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it creates a copy of the `screen` and replaces the border elements (i.e., the top, bottom, left, and right edges of the frame) that are initially dots with pluses, leaving the rest of the elements unchanged. The function then returns this modified 2D list. The function handles edge cases where the input `screen` does not contain any 'w' characters or where the frame height or width is less than 2, in which case it returns -1.
