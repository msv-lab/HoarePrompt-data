Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be correct based on the given problem description and examples. It correctly converts the input strings from the golden system to decimal numbers and compares them.

Here's a breakdown of the program's functionality:

1. It reads two input strings `a` and `b` from the user.
2. It defines a function `func_1(s)` that converts a string `s` from the golden system to a decimal number.
3. The function `func_1(s)` calculates the decimal value of the input string `s` by iterating over the characters of the string in reverse order, multiplying each character by the corresponding power of `q`, and summing the results.
4. The program compares the decimal values of `a` and `b` and prints the result of the comparison (`>` if `a` is greater, `<` if `b` is greater, and `=` if they are equal).

The program's logic is correct, and it handles the examples provided in the problem description. The output hints also suggest that the program is working as expected, as it correctly calculates the decimal values of the input strings and compares them.

Given that we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the program is considered correct. It does not need to handle cases where the input is invalid (e.g., empty string, string containing characters other than '0' and '1', etc.), as these cases are not expected to occur.
