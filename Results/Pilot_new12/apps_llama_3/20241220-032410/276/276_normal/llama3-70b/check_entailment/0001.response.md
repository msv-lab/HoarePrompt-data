Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the golden system and compares the decimal values of two given numbers in this system. The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a given number in the golden system by summing the product of each digit and the corresponding power of `q`, where `q` is the golden ratio.

The program handles the cases where the input numbers are of different lengths by padding the shorter number with zeros on the left. However, this is not explicitly done in the code, but it works because of the way the function `func_1` processes the input strings from right to left.

The comparison of the decimal values is also correct, as it checks for three cases: if the first number is larger, if it is smaller, and if they are equal.

All the examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program, and it is difficult to think of a case where it would not work as expected. The program is well-structured, and the use of the `enumerate` function to iterate over the reversed input strings is a good choice.

Therefore, it can be concluded that the program is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
