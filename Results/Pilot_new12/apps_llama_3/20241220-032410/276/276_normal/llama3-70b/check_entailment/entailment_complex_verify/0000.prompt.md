You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
    return decimal


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is designed to compare two numbers written in the "golden system" notation, which uses the golden ratio `q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2` as its base. The program defines a function `func_1` that converts a golden system number to its decimal equivalent by summing the product of each digit and the corresponding power of `q`. The main part of the program reads two golden system numbers, converts them to decimal using `func_1`, and compares their decimal values to determine which number is larger.

The program correctly handles the conversion of golden system numbers to decimal and compares them as required by the problem description. The use of `enumerate(reversed(s))` in `func_1` ensures that the digits are processed from right to left (i.e., from the least significant to the most significant), which is correct for calculating the decimal value of a number in any base, including the golden system.

The comparison logic is straightforward and correctly prints `>`, `<`, or `=` based on whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number, respectively.

There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that would cause the program to produce incorrect results. The program should work correctly for all valid inputs, including numbers of different lengths and numbers with leading zeros. 

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

a = input()
b = input()
decimal_a = func_1(a)
decimal_b = func_1(b)
if decimal_a > decimal_b:
    print('>')
elif decimal_a < decimal_b:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 and s2 are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is approximately 1.61803398875, `s` is defined as either `s1` or `s2`, `i` is one less than the length of `s`, `c` is the first character of `s`, and `decimal` is the decimal value of `s` in base `q`.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the decimal value of `s` (either `s1` or `s2`) in base `q`, where `q` is approximately 1.61803398875, and `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1' characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000 and returns the decimal value of `s` in base `q`, where `q` is approximately 1.61803398875. The function performs a base conversion from a binary-like base to decimal, utilizing the value of `q` as the base, implying that each digit's place represents a power of `q` rather than the standard base 2 for binary. After execution, the state of the program is such that the input string `s` remains unchanged, and the function returns a decimal value representing the input string's value in the specified base `q`. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as an empty string or a string containing characters other than '0' and '1', and it assumes the input length does not exceed 100000. The missing functionality includes input validation to ensure the string `s` meets the specified criteria, and handling cases where the input may not conform to these expectations. Overall, the function provides a conversion mechanism from a specific binary-like string representation to a decimal value based on a unique base `q`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
