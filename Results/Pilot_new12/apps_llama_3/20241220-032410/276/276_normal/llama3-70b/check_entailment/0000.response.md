Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is designed to compare two numbers written in the "golden system" notation, which uses the golden ratio `q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2` as its base. The program defines a function `func_1` that converts a golden system number to its decimal equivalent by summing the product of each digit and the corresponding power of `q`. The main part of the program reads two golden system numbers, converts them to decimal using `func_1`, and compares their decimal values to determine which number is larger.

The program correctly handles the conversion of golden system numbers to decimal and compares them as required by the problem description. The use of `enumerate(reversed(s))` in `func_1` ensures that the digits are processed from right to left (i.e., from the least significant to the most significant), which is correct for calculating the decimal value of a number in any base, including the golden system.

The comparison logic is straightforward and correctly prints `>`, `<`, or `=` based on whether the first number is greater than, less than, or equal to the second number, respectively.

There are no apparent edge cases or potential issues that would cause the program to produce incorrect results. The program should work correctly for all valid inputs, including numbers of different lengths and numbers with leading zeros. 

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
