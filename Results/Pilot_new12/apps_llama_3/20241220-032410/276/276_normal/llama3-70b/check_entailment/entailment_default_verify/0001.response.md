Based on the provided code, problem description, and output hints, I will maintain the original assessment.

The program correctly implements the golden system and compares the decimal values of two given numbers in this system. The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a given number in the golden system by summing the product of each digit and the corresponding power of `q`, where `q` is the golden ratio.

The output hints confirm that the function performs a base conversion from a binary-like base to decimal, utilizing the value of `q` as the base. The hints also mention that the function does not handle potential edge cases such as an empty string or a string containing characters other than '0' and '1'. However, since we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, this lack of input validation does not affect the correctness of the program.

The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` processes the input strings from right to left, effectively handling cases where the input numbers are of different lengths. The comparison of the decimal values is also correct, as it checks for three cases: if the first number is larger, if it is smaller, and if they are equal.

Overall, the program meets the problem description, and the output hints support the correctness of the program. Therefore, I will maintain the original assessment.

Final: **True**
