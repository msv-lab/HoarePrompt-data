Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here is why the program is correct:
1. The program reads two input strings, `a` and `b`, which are non-empty and consist only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000. 
2. It then calls the function `func_1` for each string, which calculates the decimal value of the input string in the "golden system" base.
3. The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value by iterating over each character in the reversed input string, multiplying the character by `q` raised to the power of the character's position, and adding the result to the total decimal value.
4. The program then compares the decimal values of `a` and `b` and prints '>' if `a` is larger, '<' if `b` is larger, and '=' if they are equal.
5. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal value of the input string based on the "golden system" base, where `q` is approximately 1.61803398875.
6. The program assumes that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors, which is in line with the problem description.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says and is correct for every potential case.
