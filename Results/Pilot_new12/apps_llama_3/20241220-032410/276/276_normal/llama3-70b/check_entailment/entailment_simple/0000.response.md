Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1.  **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two non-empty strings (`a` and `b`) consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000. These strings represent numbers in the "golden system."
2.  **Decimal Value Calculation**: The `func_1` function is used to calculate the decimal value of each input string. It does this by iterating over the characters in the input string from right to left (least significant digit to most significant), multiplying each character by `q` raised to the power of its position, and summing up the results. This is a correct implementation of the decimal value calculation as described in the problem.
3.  **Comparison**: The program compares the decimal values of the two input strings and prints the correct result based on the comparison. If the first number is larger, it prints ">"; if the second number is larger, it prints "<"; and if they are equal, it prints "=".
4.  **Use of the Golden Ratio**: The program correctly uses the golden ratio (`q`) in the calculation of the decimal values. It uses the formula `q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2` to calculate the value of `q`, which is approximately 1.61803398875.

Overall, the program accurately implements the comparison of two numbers in the "golden system" and provides the correct output for all valid input cases.

**Reasoning Why the Program Always Does What the Problem Description Says:**

1.  The program accurately reads and processes the input strings according to the problem description.
2.  The decimal value calculation is performed correctly using the golden ratio (`q`) and the position of each digit in the input string.
3.  The comparison of the decimal values is done correctly, and the output is printed accordingly.
4.  The program handles valid input correctly and does not attempt to handle invalid input cases, as per the assumption that the input will always be valid.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
