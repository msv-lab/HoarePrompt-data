Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the decimal value of two input numbers in the "golden system" and compares them. The `func_1` function converts a string representation of a number in the "golden system" to its decimal equivalent, using the value of `q` as the base.

The `func_1` function works by iterating over the input string from right to left (i.e., from the least significant digit to the most significant digit), and for each digit, it adds the value of the digit multiplied by the corresponding power of `q` to the total decimal value. This approach correctly implements the formula for converting a number from the "golden system" to decimal.

The main part of the code then uses the `func_1` function to convert both input numbers to decimal and compares their values, printing the result as either ">", "<", or "=".

The code assumes that the input will be valid, which means that the input strings will only contain '0' and '1' characters, and their lengths will not exceed 100000. Since we assume that the input will always be valid, the code does not need to handle potential edge cases such as invalid input characters or excessive input length.

The provided examples demonstrate that the code works correctly for different input cases. For instance, the first example shows that the code correctly identifies that the second number (111) is larger than the first number (1000), and the second example shows that the code correctly identifies that the two input numbers (00100 and 11) are equal.

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the required functionality, and it works as expected for the provided examples. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
