#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 and s2 are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000.
def func_1(s):
    q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2
    decimal = 0
    for (i, c) in enumerate(reversed(s)):
        decimal += int(c) * q ** i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is approximately 1.61803398875, `s` is defined as either `s1` or `s2`, `i` is one less than the length of `s`, `c` is the first character of `s`, and `decimal` is the decimal value of `s` in base `q`.
    return decimal
    #The program returns the decimal value of `s` (either `s1` or `s2`) in base `q`, where `q` is approximately 1.61803398875, and `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1' characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000 and returns the decimal value of `s` in base `q`, where `q` is approximately 1.61803398875. The function performs a base conversion from a binary-like base to decimal, utilizing the value of `q` as the base, implying that each digit's place represents a power of `q` rather than the standard base 2 for binary. After execution, the state of the program is such that the input string `s` remains unchanged, and the function returns a decimal value representing the input string's value in the specified base `q`. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as an empty string or a string containing characters other than '0' and '1', and it assumes the input length does not exceed 100000. The missing functionality includes input validation to ensure the string `s` meets the specified criteria, and handling cases where the input may not conform to these expectations. Overall, the function provides a conversion mechanism from a specific binary-like string representation to a decimal value based on a unique base `q`.
