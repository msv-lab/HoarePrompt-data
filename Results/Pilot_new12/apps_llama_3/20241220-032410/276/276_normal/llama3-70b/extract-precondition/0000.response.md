It seems like the function definition provided does not match the problem description, which requires two input strings. A more suitable function definition would be:
```python
def func_1(s1, s2):
```

Precondition: **s1 and s2 are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000.**
