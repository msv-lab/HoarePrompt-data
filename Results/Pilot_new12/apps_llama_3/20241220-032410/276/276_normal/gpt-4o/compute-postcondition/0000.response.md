The given code calculates the value of `q` using the golden ratio formula, which is `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`. This value is a constant and does not depend on the initial state of `s1` and `s2`.

Output State: **`s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, each representing a number in the golden system, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895**
