The value of `value` is increased by `q` raised to the power of `n - i - 1`. Since `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1, `n - i - 1` equals `n - 2`. Therefore, the new value of `value` is the old value of `value` plus `q` raised to the power of `n - 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `value` is the old value of `value` plus `q` raised to the power of `n - 2`**
