According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
