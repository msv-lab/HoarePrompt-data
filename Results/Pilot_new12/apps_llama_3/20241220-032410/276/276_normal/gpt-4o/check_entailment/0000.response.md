Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the decimal value of two numbers written in the golden system notation and compares them. 

Here's why the code is correct in every case:

1. The function `func_1(s)` calculates the decimal value of a number in the golden system notation. It uses the formula provided in the problem description: $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$, where $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$. 

2. The function `func_1(s)` correctly handles strings of different lengths by using the power `n - i - 1` to calculate the value of each digit. 

3. The main part of the program compares the decimal values of two numbers and prints the correct comparison result. 

4. The program handles strings containing only '0's and '1's, as specified in the problem description. 

5. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that could cause it to produce incorrect results. 

After analyzing the code and the problem description, it seems that the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
