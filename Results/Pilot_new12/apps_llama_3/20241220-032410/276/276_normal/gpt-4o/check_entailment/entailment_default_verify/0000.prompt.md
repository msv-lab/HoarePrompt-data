You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Piegirl got bored with binary, decimal and other integer based counting systems. Recently she discovered some interesting properties about number $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$, in particular that q^2 = q + 1, and she thinks it would make a good base for her new unique system. She called it "golden system". In golden system the number is a non-empty string containing 0's and 1's as digits. The decimal value of expression a_0a_1...a_{n} equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

Soon Piegirl found out that this system doesn't have same properties that integer base systems do and some operations can not be performed on it. She wasn't able to come up with a fast way of comparing two numbers. She is asking for your help.

Given two numbers written in golden system notation, determine which of them has larger decimal value.


-----Input-----

Input consists of two lines — one for each number. Each line contains non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The length of each string does not exceed 100000.


-----Output-----

Print ">" if the first number is larger, "<" if it is smaller and "=" if they are equal.


-----Examples-----
Input
1000
111

Output
<

Input
00100
11

Output
=

Input
110
101

Output
>



-----Note-----

In the first example first number equals to $((\sqrt{5} + 1) / 2)^{3} \approx 1.618033988^{3} \approx 4.236$, while second number is approximately 1.618033988^2 + 1.618033988 + 1 ≈ 5.236, which is clearly a bigger number.

In the second example numbers are equal. Each of them is  ≈ 2.618.
Program:
```
s1 = input().strip()
s2 = input().strip()
value1 = func_1(s1)
value2 = func_1(s2)
if value1 > value2:
    print('>')
elif value1 < value2:
    print('<')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
    return value


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the decimal value of two numbers written in the golden system notation and compares them. 

Here's why the code is correct in every case:

1. The function `func_1(s)` calculates the decimal value of a number in the golden system notation. It uses the formula provided in the problem description: $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$, where $q = \frac{\sqrt{5} + 1}{2}$. 

2. The function `func_1(s)` correctly handles strings of different lengths by using the power `n - i - 1` to calculate the value of each digit. 

3. The main part of the program compares the decimal values of two numbers and prints the correct comparison result. 

4. The program handles strings containing only '0's and '1's, as specified in the problem description. 

5. The program does not have any syntax errors or logical errors that could cause it to produce incorrect results. 

After analyzing the code and the problem description, it seems that the program correctly implements the required functionality and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, each representing a number in the golden system, and returns the decimal equivalent of the golden system number encoded by `s`. The function does not validate the input string, so it assumes that the input will always be a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1' characters. If the input string is empty or contains characters other than '0' and '1', the function may produce incorrect results or raise an exception. After the function concludes, the input string `s` remains unchanged, and the function returns a single decimal value representing the golden system number encoded by `s`. The function does not handle any potential overflow errors that may occur if the input string represents a very large golden system number.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
