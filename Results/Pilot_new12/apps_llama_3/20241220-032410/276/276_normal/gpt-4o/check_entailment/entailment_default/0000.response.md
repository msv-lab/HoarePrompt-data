Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. The function `func_1(s)` calculates the decimal equivalent of a golden system number encoded by the string `s`. This is done by iterating over the string and adding the corresponding power of `q` to the total value whenever a '1' is encountered.

The main part of the code compares the decimal equivalents of the two input numbers and prints the correct comparison operator ('>', '<', or '=').

The code assumes that the input will be valid, i.e., two non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, as stated in the problem description. Given this assumption, the code correctly handles all potential cases. The provided examples in the problem description also work correctly with the given code.

The output hints agree with the code and do not indicate any potential errors or edge cases that are not handled by the code. Therefore, based on the provided information, it can be concluded that the code is correct for all potential cases.
