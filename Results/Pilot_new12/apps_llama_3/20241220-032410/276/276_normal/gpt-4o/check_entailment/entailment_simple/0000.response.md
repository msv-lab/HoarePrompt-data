Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The program reads two input strings `s1` and `s2` from the user, which represent numbers in the golden system. This is in line with the problem description.

2. It defines a function `func_1` that calculates the decimal value of a number in the golden system. This is done using the formula `value = ∑(a_i * q^(n-i))` where `q = (√5 + 1) / 2` and `n` is the length of the string.

3. The function `func_1` iterates over each character in the input string. If the character is '1', it adds `q` raised to the power of `n-i-1` to the total value. This correctly implements the formula for the decimal value of a number in the golden system.

4. After calculating the decimal values of both numbers, the program compares these values and prints the corresponding output ('>', '<', or '=').

No potential case exists where the program does not follow the problem description. 

The only assumption made here is that the input will always be valid, which is stated in the problem description. If the input is guaranteed to be valid (i.e., two non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters), the program will always produce the correct output. 

In summary, the program is correct because it accurately implements the formula for calculating the decimal value of a number in the golden system and compares these values as required by the problem description.
