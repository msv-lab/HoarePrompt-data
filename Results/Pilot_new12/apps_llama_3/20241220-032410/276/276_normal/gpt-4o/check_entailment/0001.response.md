Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly implement the golden system notation comparison as per the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes two input strings `s1` and `s2` representing numbers in golden system notation.
2. It defines a function `func_1` that calculates the decimal value of a given golden system number.
3. Within `func_1`, it calculates the value of `q` (the golden ratio) and initializes a variable `value` to 0.
4. It then iterates over each character in the input string `s`. If the character is '1', it adds the corresponding power of `q` to the `value`.
5. The program compares the calculated decimal values of `s1` and `s2` and prints the result accordingly ('>', '<', or '=').

The key insight here is that the golden system notation can be represented as a sum of powers of `q`, where `q` is the golden ratio. The program correctly implements this calculation and comparison.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I couldn't find any potential case where the program doesn't work as expected. The code seems to handle all possible inputs correctly, including edge cases like empty strings (although the problem statement specifies that the input strings are non-empty) or strings with only '0's or only '1's.

The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For instance, in the first example, the program correctly determines that the decimal value of `1000` is less than that of `111`.

In conclusion, based on the analysis and the lack of any apparent counterexamples, I believe that the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
