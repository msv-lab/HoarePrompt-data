The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, and based on the provided code and annotations, this assessment seems to be accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality required to compare two numbers written in the golden system notation.

The annotated version of the code provides additional insight into the program's behavior, but it does not reveal any errors or inconsistencies with the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the decimal value of a number in the golden system notation using the provided formula, and the main part of the program compares the decimal values of two numbers and prints the correct comparison result.

The annotations also highlight that the function does not validate the input string, but this is not a concern since we assume that the input will always be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

The only potential issue mentioned in the annotations is the possibility of overflow errors for very large golden system numbers, but this is not a problem with the program's logic or implementation. It is a limitation of the programming language or environment being used.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
