Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the golden system number comparison as described in the problem. The function `func_1` accurately calculates the decimal equivalent of a given golden system number, and the main part of the code compares the decimal values of the two input numbers to determine the correct output.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem, including the comparison of two numbers with different lengths and the case where the two numbers are equal. The function `func_1` also correctly handles the calculation of the decimal value for numbers with leading zeros.

The output hints provided do not indicate any cases where the code fails to produce the correct output. Additionally, the examples given in the problem description are correctly handled by the code.

It's worth noting that the code assumes that the input will always be a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, which is a valid assumption according to the problem description. The code does not include any error handling for invalid inputs, but this is not required according to the problem description.

Overall, the code correctly implements the golden system number comparison as described in the problem, and it handles all potential cases as required.
