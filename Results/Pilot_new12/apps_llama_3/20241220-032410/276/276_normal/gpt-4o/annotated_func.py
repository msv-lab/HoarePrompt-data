#State of the program right berfore the function call: s1 and s2 are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, each representing a number in the golden system.
def func_1(s):
    q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2
    value = 0
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '1':
            value += q ** (n - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, `n` is the length of `s1`, `i` is `n-1`, and `value` represents the golden system number encoded by `s1`.
    return value
    #The program returns the golden system number encoded by string `s1`, where `s1` is a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1' characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, each representing a number in the golden system, and returns the decimal equivalent of the golden system number encoded by `s`. The function does not validate the input string, so it assumes that the input will always be a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1' characters. If the input string is empty or contains characters other than '0' and '1', the function may produce incorrect results or raise an exception. After the function concludes, the input string `s` remains unchanged, and the function returns a single decimal value representing the golden system number encoded by `s`. The function does not handle any potential overflow errors that may occur if the input string represents a very large golden system number.
