The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting of '0' and '1' characters, each representing a number in the golden system, and returns the decimal equivalent of the golden system number encoded by `s`. The function does not validate the input string, so it assumes that the input will always be a non-empty string consisting only of '0' and '1' characters. If the input string is empty or contains characters other than '0' and '1', the function may produce incorrect results or raise an exception. After the function concludes, the input string `s` remains unchanged, and the function returns a single decimal value representing the golden system number encoded by `s`. The function does not handle any potential overflow errors that may occur if the input string represents a very large golden system number.
