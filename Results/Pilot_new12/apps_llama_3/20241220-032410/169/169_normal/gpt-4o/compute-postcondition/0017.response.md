To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. `n` is an input integer.
2. `s` is an input string that must have at least 3 characters.
3. `operation` is the third character in the string `s`.
4. The initial value of `stones` depends on the value of `operation`: 
   - If `operation` is '+', then `stones` is 2.
   - If `operation` is '-', then `stones` is 0.
   - If `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` is 1.

Given the code `stones += 1`, we are incrementing the value of `stones` by 1.

So, after executing the code:
- If `operation` is '+', then `stones` becomes 2 + 1 = 3.
- If `operation` is '-', then `stones` becomes 0 + 1 = 1.
- If `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` becomes 1 + 1 = 2.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `operation`) are not affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 3 characters, `operation` is the third character in the string `s`, if `operation` is '+', then `stones` is 3, if `operation` is '-', then `stones` is 1, if `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 3 characters, `operation` is the third character in the string `s`, `stones` is 3 if `operation` is '+', `stones` is 1 if `operation` is '-', `stones` is 2 if `operation` is neither '+' nor '-'**
