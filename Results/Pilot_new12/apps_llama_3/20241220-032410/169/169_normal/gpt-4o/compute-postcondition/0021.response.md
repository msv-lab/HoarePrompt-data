To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code iterates over each character `operation` in the input string `s`. Depending on the value of `operation`, it either increments `stones` by 1 if `operation` is '+', or decrements `stones` by 1 (but not below 0) if `operation` is '-'.

From the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can observe the following patterns:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `s` must have at least as many characters as the number of iterations.
- `operation` is the character in `s` that corresponds to the current iteration (first character for the first iteration, second character for the second iteration, etc.).
- The value of `stones` depends on the sequence of '+' and '-' operations encountered. For each '+', `stones` increases by 1, and for each '-', `stones` decreases by 1 but never goes below 0.

Given this behavior, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `n` will still be the input integer as it is not modified by the loop.
- `s` will have been fully traversed, meaning all its characters have been processed.
- `operation` will be the last character in `s`, since the loop iterates over each character in `s` once.
- `stones` will reflect the net effect of all '+' and '-' operations. Since '+' increases `stones` and '-' decreases it (but not below 0), `stones` will be the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations.

Therefore, considering the initial state and the effects of the loop, the output state after all iterations is:
Output State: **`n` is the original input integer, `s` is the original input string, `operation` is the last character in `s`, and `stones` is the maximum of 0 and the sum of the number of '+' operations minus the number of '-' operations in `s`.**
