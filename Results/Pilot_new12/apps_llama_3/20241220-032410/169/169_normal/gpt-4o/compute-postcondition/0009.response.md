Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `stones` is 0. If `operation` is '-', then `operation` is the first character in the string `s`. If `operation` is not '-', since there is no else part, the state remains the same as the precondition, i.e., `operation` is the first character in the string `s` and `operation` is not equal to '+'***
