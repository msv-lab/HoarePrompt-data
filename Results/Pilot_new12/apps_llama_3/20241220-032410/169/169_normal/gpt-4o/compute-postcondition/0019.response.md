Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 3 characters, `operation` is the third character in the string `s`. If `operation` is '-', then the conditions after the if block are met. If `operation` is not '-', then `stones` is 1 if `operation` is '+', `stones` is 0 if `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', and the initial condition for `stones` when `operation` is '-' is overridden to be 0, resulting in `stones` being 0 for `operation` '-' and the other conditions for `stones` remaining as initially stated for other operations***
