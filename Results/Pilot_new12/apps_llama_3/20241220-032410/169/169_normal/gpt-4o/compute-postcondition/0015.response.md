Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `operation` is the second character in the string `s`. If `operation` is '+', then `stones` is 2. If `operation` is '-', then `stones` is 0. If `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` is 1, reflecting the update based on the initial settings before the if statement.**
