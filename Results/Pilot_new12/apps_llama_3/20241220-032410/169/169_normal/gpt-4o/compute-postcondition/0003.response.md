According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, and `stones` is 0. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least 1 character, and `operation` is the first character in the string.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `stones` is 0, `operation` is the first character in the string**
