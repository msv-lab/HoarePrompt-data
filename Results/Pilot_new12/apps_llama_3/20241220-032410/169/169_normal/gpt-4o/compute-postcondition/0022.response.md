The given Python code snippet only contains a print statement, which outputs the current value of the `stones` variable but does not modify any variables. 

The value of `stones` is the maximum of 0 and the sum of the number of '+' operations minus the number of '-' operations in `s`. This means `stones` equals `max(0, s.count('+') - s.count('-'))`.

After printing `stones`, the values of `n`, `s`, `operation`, and `stones` remain unchanged because the print statement does not affect their values. 

The `operation` is still the last character in `s`, and `n` is still the original input integer. The state of the variables after the execution is that `n` is the original input integer, `s` is the original input string, `operation` is the last character in `s`, and `stones` is `max(0, s.count('+') - s.count('-'))`. Also, the value of `stones` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is the original input integer, `s` is the original input string, `operation` is the last character in `s`, `stones` is `max(0, s.count('+') - s.count('-'))`, and the value of `stones` has been returned at the output.**
