It seems there is a mistake in the prompt as the function `func()` does not seem to accept any parameters, but based on the description, it should accept two parameters, `n` and `s`. Assuming the function should be `def func(n, s):`, let's proceed with the analysis.

The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.

Since the output is not specified, I will provide a general description based on the parameters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.
Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters.**
