According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has at least 1 character, `operation` is the first character in the string `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters and `operation` is the second character in the string `s`. If the second character is '+', then `stones` is 1. If the second character is '-', then `stones` is 0. If the second character is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` is 0.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `operation` is the second character in the string `s`, if `operation` is '+', then `stones` is 1, if `operation` is '-', then `stones` is 0, if `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` is 0**
