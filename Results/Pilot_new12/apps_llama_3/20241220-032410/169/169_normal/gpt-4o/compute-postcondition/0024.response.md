Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters, where `n` is input by the user and verified to be between 1 and 100, and it returns the net count of '+' operations after considering each '+' as an increment and each '-' as a decrement, but never going below 0. The function effectively calculates the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of '+' characters and the number of '-' characters in the string `s`, ignoring the integer `n` for any calculations beyond ensuring it is a valid input length. After execution, the program prints this net count, and the state of the program concludes with `n` and `s` remaining unchanged from their initial input values, `operation` being the last character processed in `s`, and `stones` holding the final net count before being printed. The function handles edge cases such as when `s` contains only '-' characters or when the net count would be negative, ensuring the result is never less than 0.**
