To calculate the output state, we need to consider the initial values of the variables and the impact of the given code on these variables.

The code is `stones = max(0, stones - 1)`. This means the value of `stones` will be decreased by 1, but it will not go below 0 due to the `max(0,...)` function.

From the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters.
- `operation` is the second character in the string `s`.
- If `operation` is '+', then `stones` is 1.
- If `operation` is '-', then `stones` is 0.
- If `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` is 0.

After executing `stones = max(0, stones - 1)`:
- If `stones` was 1 (which happens when `operation` is '+'), it will become 0 because `max(0, 1 - 1) = max(0, 0) = 0`.
- If `stones` was 0 (which happens when `operation` is '-' or neither '+' nor '-'), it will remain 0 because `max(0, 0 - 1) = max(0, -1) = 0`.

Therefore, regardless of the initial value of `stones`, after the execution of the code, `stones` will be 0.

The variables `n`, `s`, and `operation` are not affected by the code, so their states remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `operation` is the second character in the string `s`, and `stones` is 0**
