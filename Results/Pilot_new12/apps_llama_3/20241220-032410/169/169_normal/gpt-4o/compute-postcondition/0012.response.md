The value of `stones` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `stones` depends on the value of `operation`, which is the second character in the string `s`. If `operation` is '+', then `stones` was 1, if `operation` is '-', then `stones` was 0, if `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` was 0.

So, if `operation` is '+', then `stones` becomes 1 + 1 = 2, 
if `operation` is '-', then `stones` becomes 0 + 1 = 1, 
if `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` becomes 0 + 1 = 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `operation` is the second character in the string `s`, if `operation` is '+', then `stones` is 2, if `operation` is '-', then `stones` is 1, if `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `operation` is the second character in the string `s`, `stones` is 2 if `operation` is '+', `stones` is 1 if `operation` is '-' or neither '+' nor '-'**
