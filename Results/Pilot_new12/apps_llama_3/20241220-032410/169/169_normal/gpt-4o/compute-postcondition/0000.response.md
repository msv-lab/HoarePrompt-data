The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The initial state of `n` is that it is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), but this state is overridden by the new input value. The state of `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is a string (the relationship between `n` and the length of `s` is no longer guaranteed as `n` is updated with the input value)**
