The value of `stones` is updated to be the maximum of 0 and `stones - 1`. Since the current value of `stones` is 0, subtracting 1 from it will result in -1. However, the `max` function ensures that `stones` is not less than 0, so `stones` remains 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `stones` is 0, `operation` is the first character in the string `s`, `operation` is not equal to '+', and the current value of `operation` is '-'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `stones` is 0, `operation` is '-', and `operation` is the first character in the string `s`.**
