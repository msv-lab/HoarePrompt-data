Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character. If `operation` is '+', then `stones` is 1. If `operation` is '-', then `stones` is 0 and `operation` is the first character in the string `s`. If `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', then `stones` is 0 and `operation` remains the first character in the string `s`.**
