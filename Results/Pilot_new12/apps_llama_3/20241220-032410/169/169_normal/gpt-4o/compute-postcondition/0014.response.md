Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `operation` is the second character in the string `s`. If `operation` is '-', then the conditions are as specified for the if part, where `stones` is 0. If `operation` is not '-', then `stones` is either 1 if `operation` is '+' or 0 if `operation` is neither '+' nor '-', reflecting the initial settings before the if statement.***
