The code increments the value of `stones` by 1. The previous value of `stones` is 0, so the new value of `stones` is 0 + 1 = 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, the first character of `s` has been assigned to `operation` and the current value of `operation` is '+', `stones` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `operation` is '+', `stones` is 1**
