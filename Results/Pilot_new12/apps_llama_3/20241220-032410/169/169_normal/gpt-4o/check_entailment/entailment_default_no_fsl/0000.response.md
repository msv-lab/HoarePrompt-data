Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description because it assumes that the initial number of stones is 0. However, the problem description states that the minimal possible number of stones can be in the pile after making these operations, without specifying that the initial number of stones must be 0.

The problem description provides examples where the initial number of stones is not 0, such as the first test where the initial number of stones is 3. In this case, the code will not produce the correct output because it starts with 0 stones.

To fix this, the code needs to iterate over all possible initial numbers of stones and calculate the final number of stones after the operations. The minimum of these final numbers of stones would be the correct output.

For instance, if the input string is "++-++" and we start with 0 stones, the code will correctly output 3. However, if we start with a different initial number of stones, the code should be able to calculate the correct output based on that initial number. 

The provided code does not consider these cases and therefore does not meet the problem requirements. 

Here is an example of how the correct code could look like:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = float('inf')
    for initial_stones in range(1, n + 1):
        stones = initial_stones
        for operation in s:
            if operation == '+':
                stones += 1
            elif operation == '-':
                stones -= 1
        if stones < min_stones:
            min_stones = stones
    print(min_stones)
```
