Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem asks for the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations, but the program simply calculates the net count of '+' operations after considering each '+' as an increment and each '-' as a decrement, but never going below 0.

The issue with the program is that it does not consider the number of stones that Vasya had at the beginning. The program always starts with 0 stones, but the problem description states that Vasya had some number of stones at the beginning, and the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile.

For example, if the input is "3" and "---", the program will correctly output "0", because Vasya had 0 stones at the beginning and took 3 stones from the pile, resulting in 0 stones. However, if the input is "3" and "+--", the program will output "1", which is not correct. The problem description states that Vasya had some number of stones at the beginning, and the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. Therefore, the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations is 1, if Vasya had 1 stone at the beginning.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program needs to consider all possible numbers of stones that Vasya had at the beginning and calculate the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = float('inf')
    for initial_stones in range(1, n + 1):
        stones = initial_stones
        for operation in s:
            if operation == '+':
                stones += 1
            elif operation == '-':
                stones -= 1
        min_stones = min(min_stones, stones)
    print(min_stones)
```
