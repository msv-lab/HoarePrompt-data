Correctness: **False**

The code provided attempts to find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making a series of operations. However, it starts with an assumption that the initial number of stones is 0, which is not necessarily the minimal starting point.

The problem statement requires finding the minimal number of stones after a series of operations, where each operation either adds or removes a stone, and the pile must not be empty before removing a stone. This implies that the minimal starting number of stones should be equal to the number of removal operations in the worst-case scenario.

The code does not consider this aspect correctly. It simply counts the net result of the operations without considering the minimal starting point that would allow all removal operations to be valid.

For example, if the input string is "----", the code will output 0, but the problem description implies that the minimal starting number of stones should be at least 4 to allow all four removal operations to be valid. Therefore, the code does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. 

The correct code should calculate the minimum number of starting stones required to perform all removal operations and then apply the operations to find the minimal possible number of stones after all operations are completed. 

Here is an example of how the code could be corrected:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    minus_count = s.count('-')
    plus_count = s.count('+')
    stones = max(1, minus_count) + plus_count - minus_count
    print(max(0, stones))

func()
```
