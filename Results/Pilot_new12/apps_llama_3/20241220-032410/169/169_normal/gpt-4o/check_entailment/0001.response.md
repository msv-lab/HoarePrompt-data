Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for every potential case. The issue arises from the fact that the program starts with 0 stones and then performs the operations. However, according to the problem description, the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile. This means that the number of stones at the beginning can't be less than the number of '-' operations.

For example, if the input is a string of only '-' operations, the program will not work correctly because it will not consider the case where the initial number of stones is equal to the number of '-' operations. 

To fix this issue, the program should start with the number of stones equal to the number of '-' operations in the string, and then perform the operations. 

Here's an example of a case when the program does not work correctly:
Input:
3
---
The program will output: 0 (which is correct but this is because it happened to work for this example, but it is incorrect because if it were - and then +, it fails because it assumes 0 stones initially)
However if the program was given:
2
-+
It would incorrectly output: 1, when the correct answer is indeed 1 in the sense that you need at least one stone initially for the subtraction to occur. However, this does not cover cases when - is not followed by +. To handle such cases correctly, we must know the number of - before we start. So for an input of just '-' the program fails in determining the minimum stones for the entire sequence. 

The program only checks if there are any '+' operations, but it does not check if the number of stones at the beginning is sufficient for the '-' operations. It should calculate the minimum stones at the start and then simulate the string. 

This program works fine for sequences with more '+' than '-' but fails when there are more '-' because for the program to run we must have at least enough stones initially so we can subtract them. Hence the number of stones initially should be equal to the number of '-' to handle such sequences correctly. 

For sequences with just '-' the number of stones should be equal to the number of '-' and for sequences with an equal number of '+' and '-' the number of stones initially should be 1 to correctly handle all cases.
