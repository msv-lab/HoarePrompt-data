Correctness: **False**.

The problem asks for the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the operations. The given program simply simulates the operations starting with 0 stones and prints the final count of stones. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimal possible number of stones.

A correct approach would be to find the minimum number of stones required at the beginning such that all the operations can be performed. This can be achieved by finding the maximum number of consecutive '-' operations and adding 1 to it, then simulate the operations from there.

For example, if the input is "3" and "--+", the given program will print 1, but the correct answer is 0 because Vasya can start with 2 stones and end up with 0 stones after making the operations. 

The given program does not handle this case correctly because it starts with 0 stones and does not consider the possibility of starting with a different number of stones to achieve the minimum possible number of stones at the end. 

Therefore, the Correctness of the given program is **False**.
