The code introduces a new variable `plus_count` which is assigned the value of the number of '+' characters in the string `s`. This can be calculated as the total length of the string `n` minus the number of '-' characters `minus_count`, since the string only contains '+' or '-' characters. Therefore, `plus_count` is equal to `n - minus_count`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` remains a positive integer, `s` remains a string of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters, and `minus_count` remains the number of '-' characters in `s`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, `plus_count` is `n - minus_count`**
