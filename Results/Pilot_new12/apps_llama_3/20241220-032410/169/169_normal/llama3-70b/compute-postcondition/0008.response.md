Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, `plus_count` is `n - minus_count`. If `minus_count` is higher than `plus_count`, the value 0 has been printed. Otherwise, the value `2 * plus_count - n` or `n - 2 * minus_count` has been printed.**
