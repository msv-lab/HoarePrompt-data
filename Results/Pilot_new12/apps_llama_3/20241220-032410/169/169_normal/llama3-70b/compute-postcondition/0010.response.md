Functionality: **The function accepts two inputs, a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters. It calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in `s`. If the number of '-' characters is greater than the number of '+' characters, it prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is equivalent to `2 * plus_count - n` or `n - 2 * minus_count`. The function does not return any value; instead, it prints the calculated difference or 0 to the console, and the state of the program after execution will be that the input variables `n` and `s` have been utilized to produce this output, with `n` being a positive integer and `s` being a string of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters. The function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer or non-positive inputs for `n`, or strings `s` longer or shorter than `n` or containing characters other than '+' or '-', and it does not provide any error messages or handling mechanisms for such cases.**
