To solve this task, we first analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. 

The initial state provides that `n` is a positive integer and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters. 

The code snippet is:
```python
minus_count = s.count('-')
```

This line of code counts the number of occurrences of the character '-' in the string `s` and assigns this count to the variable `minus_count`.

Given that `s` is a string of length `n` and contains only '+' or '-' characters, the count of '-' characters will be a non-negative integer less than or equal to `n`, because it cannot exceed the total length of the string.

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state will include the initial conditions for `n` and `s`, and the new information about `minus_count`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`, which is an integer such that 0 <= `minus_count` <= `n`.**
