The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. Since the input to the function consists of a positive integer `n` followed by a string `s` of length `n`, the value of `n` will be a positive integer. The string `s` is not yet assigned to any variable.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, there is a string `s` of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters, which has not been assigned to any variable yet**
