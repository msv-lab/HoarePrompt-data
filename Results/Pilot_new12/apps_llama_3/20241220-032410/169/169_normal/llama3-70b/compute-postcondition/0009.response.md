The function `func` accepts two parameters, an integer `n` and a string `s`. `n` is a positive integer and `s` is a string of length `n` containing only '+' or '-' characters. 

However, the provided function definition is incorrect as it does not accept any parameters. The correct function definition should be:
```python
def func(n, s):
```
After executing the function body, the return value is not explicitly stated in the problem description. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` cannot be fully determined without further information about the return value.


To provide a complete answer, I will assume the problem description is incomplete and provide a general description of the function's parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a positive integer n and a string s of length n containing only '+' or '-' characters, but the return value is not specified.**
