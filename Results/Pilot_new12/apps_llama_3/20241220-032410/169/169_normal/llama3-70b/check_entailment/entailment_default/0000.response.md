Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly solves the problem described. It calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s`, which represents the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after all operations. The condition `if minus_count > plus_count` checks if the number of operations to remove stones is more than the number of operations to add stones. If this condition is true, the code prints 0, indicating that the minimum possible number of stones in the pile is 0. Otherwise, it prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters.

The code handles all possible cases correctly, including the examples provided in the problem description. For instance, when the input is `3` and the string is `---`, the code correctly prints `0`, which is the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after all operations. Similarly, when the input is `4` and the string is `++++`, the code correctly prints `4`, which is the minimum possible number of stones in the pile after all operations.

The output hints agree with the code and confirm that the code behaves as expected. The code assumes that the input will be valid, which is a reasonable assumption based on the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct, and the Correctness is **True**.
