Correctness: **True**.

The given program seems to be correct because it handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement. 

Here's why the code works correctly:

- The problem requires finding the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing n operations.
- The program first counts the number of '-' (minus) and '+' (plus) operations in the string.
- If the number of minus operations is greater than the number of plus operations, the program prints 0. This is because the number of minus operations must be less than or equal to the initial number of stones, so the minimal possible number of stones after all operations is 0.
- If the number of minus operations is less than or equal to the number of plus operations, the program prints the difference between the number of plus operations and the number of minus operations. This is because the minimal possible number of stones after all operations is the initial number of stones (which must be at least as large as the number of minus operations) plus the net number of stones added.

All examples given also validate this explanation. For instance, in the first test case where the operations are '---', the program correctly outputs 0 because the minimal possible number of stones after all operations is 0. Similarly, in the second test case where the operations are '++++', the program correctly outputs 4 because the minimal possible number of stones after all operations is 4.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
