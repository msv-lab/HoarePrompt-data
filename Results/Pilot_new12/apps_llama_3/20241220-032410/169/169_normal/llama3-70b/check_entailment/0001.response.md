Correctness: **True**

The program provided correctly solves the problem described. It calculates the minimum possible number of stones that can be in the pile after a series of operations by Vasya.

Here's a breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly handles the input as per the problem description. It reads the number of operations `n` and the string `s` representing the operations.

2. **Counting Operations**: It counts the number of '-' (taking a stone) and '+' (adding a stone) operations in the string `s`.

3. **Calculating the Result**: 
   - If the number of '-' operations is greater than the number of '+' operations, it means that Vasya must have started with at least the number of '-' operations worth of stones to not have an empty pile. In this case, the minimum possible number of stones left at the end is 0, because we can assume Vasya started with exactly the number of stones needed to just complete the '-' operations, given that he couldn't take from an empty pile.
   - Otherwise, the difference between the number of '+' and '-' operations gives the minimum possible number of stones left at the end, assuming Vasya started with 0 stones (since adding more stones initially would only increase the final count).

The program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case and does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle. The logic directly aligns with the problem's constraints and outcomes as described, ensuring that the program always outputs the minimal possible number of stones after the operations based on the given sequence. 

Therefore, based on the analysis, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
