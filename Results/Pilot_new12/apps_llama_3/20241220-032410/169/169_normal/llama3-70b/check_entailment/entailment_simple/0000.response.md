Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem described. Here's why:

1. The program correctly counts the number of '+' and '-' operations in the string `s`.
2. It then checks if the number of '-' operations (`minus_count`) is greater than the number of '+' operations (`plus_count`).
3. If `minus_count` is greater than `plus_count`, it means that Vasya must have started with at least as many stones as the number of '-' operations. In this case, the minimum possible number of stones left in the pile is 0, which is what the program prints.
4. If `minus_count` is not greater than `plus_count`, it means that Vasya must have started with 0 stones (since the number of '+' operations is greater than or equal to the number of '-' operations). In this case, the minimum possible number of stones left in the pile is the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations, which is what the program prints.

This logic aligns with the problem description, which requires finding the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the given operations.

The key insight here is that the program doesn't need to simulate the actual operations or keep track of the number of stones at each step. It can simply count the number of '+' and '-' operations and use that information to determine the minimum possible number of stones left in the pile.

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the required logic and produces the correct output for all possible inputs.
