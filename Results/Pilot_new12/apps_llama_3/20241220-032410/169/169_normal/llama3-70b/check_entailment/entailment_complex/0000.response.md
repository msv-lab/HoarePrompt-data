Correctness: **True**

The given program follows the problem description and meets its requirements. 

Here's why the program is correct:

- The problem asks for the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after making n operations.
- If Vasya took more stones than he added, the minimum number of stones left in the pile is 0, because he must have had at least as many stones as he took.
- If Vasya added more stones than he took, the minimum number of stones left in the pile is the difference between the number of stones he added and the number of stones he took.
- The program calculates the difference between the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s`, which represents the operations performed by Vasya.
- If the number of '-' characters (representing stones taken) is greater than the number of '+' characters (representing stones added), the program prints 0, which is the minimum number of stones left in the pile.
- If the number of '-' characters is not greater than the number of '+' characters, the program prints the difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters, which is the minimum number of stones left in the pile.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem and meets its requirements. It handles all possible cases as described in the problem and always produces the correct output. 

For example, in the first test case where the input is `3` and `---`, the program correctly prints `0`. In the second test case where the input is `4` and `++++`, the program correctly prints `4`. 

The provided program always follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all valid inputs, hence it is correct.
