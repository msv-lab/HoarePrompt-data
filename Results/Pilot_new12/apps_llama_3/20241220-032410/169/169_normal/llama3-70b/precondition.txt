## Step 1: Understand the problem description and the given function definition.
The problem involves Vasya performing a series of operations on a pile of stones, where each operation is either taking one stone from the pile or adding one stone to the pile. The goal is to find the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after these operations.

## Step 2: Identify the input variables and their relationships based on the problem description.
The input variables are the number of operations $n$ and the string $s$ consisting of $n$ symbols, where each symbol is either "-" (indicating the removal of a stone) or "+" (indicating the addition of a stone).

## Step 3: Determine the constraints on the input variables.
The number of operations $n$ is a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive. The string $s$ has a length of $n$ and consists only of "-" and "+" characters.

## Step 4: Formulate the precondition based on the identified variables and their relationships.
The precondition should describe the constraints on the input variables $n$ and $s$. Based on the problem description, $n$ is a positive integer such that $1 \leq n \leq 100$, and $s$ is a string of length $n$ consisting of "-" and "+" characters.

The final answer is: $\boxed{n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and s is a string of length n consisting of "-" and "+" characters.}$
