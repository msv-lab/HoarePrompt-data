The code affects the `speeds` list by updating the element at index `i`, which is 3. The new value of `speeds[3]` is the minimum of `speeds[2] + d` and `v2 + (t - 4) * d`. 

Given the initial state of the `speeds` list, the second element is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)`, the third element is `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`. 

The value of `speeds[3]` becomes `min(min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 4) * d)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 3, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`, the third element is the minimum of `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d` and `v2 + (t - 3) * d`, the fourth element is the minimum of `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d) + d` and `v2 + (t - 4) * d`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements except the first, second, third, and the last are zeros, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 3, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`, the third element is the minimum of `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d` and `v2 + (t - 3) * d`, the fourth element is the minimum of `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d) + d` and `v2 + (t - 4) * d`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements except the first, second, third, and the last are zeros, `i` is 3**
