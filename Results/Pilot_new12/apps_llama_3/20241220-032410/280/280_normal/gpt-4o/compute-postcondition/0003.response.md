The value of `speeds[0]` is updated to `v1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The list `speeds` initially contained `t` zeros, but now its first element is `v1` and the rest of the elements remain zeros. 

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1` and the rest are zeros**
