The code `speeds[-1] = v2` updates the last element of the list `speeds` to be `v2`. 

The initial state is: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1` and the rest are zeros.

The value of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` remains unchanged. The list `speeds` now has its last element changed to `v2`, but its length remains `t`. The first element of `speeds` is still `v1`, and all other elements except the first and the last are zeros.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements except the first and the last are zeros.**
