To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code step by step.

Given:
- `v1` is an input integer
- `v2` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer that must be at least 2
- `d` is an input integer
- `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements except the first and the last are zeros. This means `speeds = [v1, 0, 0,..., 0, v2]`.
- `i` is 1

The code to execute is:
```python
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

When `i = 1`, `speeds[i - 1]` refers to `speeds[0]`, which is `v1`. So, the equation becomes:
```python
speeds[1] = min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 1 - 1) * d)
```
Simplifying the equation gives:
```python
speeds[1] = min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)
```

Thus, the value of `speeds[1]` is updated to be the minimum between `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer that must be at least 2, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements except the first, second, and the last are zeros, `i` is 1**
