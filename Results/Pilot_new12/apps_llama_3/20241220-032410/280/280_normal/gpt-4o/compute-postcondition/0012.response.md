To calculate the output state, let's first understand the initial state and the given Python code snippet. 

In the initial state:
- `v1` is an input integer.
- `v2` is an input integer.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `d` is an input integer.
- `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`. For `t > 1`, all other elements except the first and the last are determined by a loop's iterative calculation.
- `i` is `t-1` if `t` is greater than 1. If `t` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `speeds` remains a list with `v1` as its first and only element.

The given Python code snippet calculates the `total_distance` by summing all the elements in the `speeds` list.

Given that `speeds` starts with `v1`, ends with `v2`, and considering the iterative calculation for its middle elements when `t > 1`, we can infer that `speeds` is essentially a list of speeds where the distance `d` is covered in time `t` with the initial speed `v1` and final speed `v2`.

However, the exact calculation for the middle elements of `speeds` is not provided in the initial state description. But since we are asked to calculate the `total_distance` which is the sum of all speeds in `speeds`, we can proceed under the assumption that `total_distance` is directly related to how these speeds are calculated and summed up.

If we consider a simple scenario where the acceleration is uniform (which seems a reasonable assumption given the context, but note that the problem doesn't explicitly state how speeds in the list are calculated for `t > 1`), the average speed over a period of time `t` can be used to estimate the total distance traveled. However, without explicit information on how each speed in `speeds` is calculated for `t > 1`, we proceed with the understanding that `total_distance` is the sum of all elements in `speeds`, and this directly depends on the values of `v1`, `v2`, and the calculated intermediate speeds.

Given this, the code:
```python
total_distance = sum(speeds)
```
simply calculates the sum of all speeds in the `speeds` list and assigns this sum to `total_distance`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `v1` is an input integer.
- `v2` is an input integer.
- `t` is an input integer.
- `d` is an input integer.
- `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, with other elements determined by the iterative calculation for `t > 1`.
- `i` is `t-1` if `t` is greater than 1, otherwise, `i`'s value is not altered by the given code snippet.
- `total_distance` is the sum of all elements in the `speeds` list.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list with first element `v1` and last element `v2`, `i` is `t-1` if `t > 1`, and `total_distance` is the sum of all elements in `speeds`.**
