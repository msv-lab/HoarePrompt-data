The value of `speeds[i]` is updated to be the minimum of `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. Given that `i` is 2, `speeds[i]` refers to the third element in the list `speeds`. 

Before this update, the list `speeds` was `[v1, min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d), 0,..., 0, v2]`. Now, the third element is updated to `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d` is not correct because `speeds[i-1]` is `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d)` when `i` is 2, and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d` is `v2 + (t - 3) * d`. 

The third element becomes `min(min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d, v2 + (t - 3) * d)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`, the third element is the minimum of `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d` and `v2 + (t - 3) * d`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements except the first, second, third, and the last are zeros, `i` is 2.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer that must be greater than 2, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`, the third element is the minimum of `min(v1 + d, v2 + (t - 2) * d) + d` and `v2 + (t - 3) * d`, the last element is `v2`, and all other elements except the first, second, third, and the last are zeros, `i` is 2**
