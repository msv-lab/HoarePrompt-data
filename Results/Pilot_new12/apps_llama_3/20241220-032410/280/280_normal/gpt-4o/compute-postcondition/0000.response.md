The given code takes two integer inputs and assigns them to `v1` and `v2`. This means that `v1` is assigned the value of the first integer input, and `v2` is assigned the value of the second integer input. The previous values of `v_1` and `v_2` are overwritten by the input values. The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive)**
