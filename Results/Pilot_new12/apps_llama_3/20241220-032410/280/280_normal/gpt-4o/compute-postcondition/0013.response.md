The code prints the `total_distance`, which is the sum of all elements in the `speeds` list. This operation does not change the values of the variables. 

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list with first element `v1` and last element `v2`, `i` is `t-1` if `t > 1`, `total_distance` is the sum of all elements in `speeds`, and the sum of all elements in `speeds` has been printed**
