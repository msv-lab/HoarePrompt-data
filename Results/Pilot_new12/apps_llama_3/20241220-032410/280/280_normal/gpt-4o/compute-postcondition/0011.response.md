To determine the output state after all the iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(1, t):
    speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can see a pattern in how the `speeds` list is updated. The general pattern for the `i-th` element in the `speeds` list seems to be the minimum of the previous element plus `d` and `v2` plus `(t - i - 1) * d`.

If `t` is 1, the loop will not execute, and the `speeds` list will remain unchanged, with the first element being `v1` and the last element being `v2` (though, in this case, they are the same element since `t` is 1).

If `t` is greater than 1, the loop will execute, and the `speeds` list will be updated accordingly.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `speeds` list will have its elements updated based on the pattern observed, except for the last element which remains `v2`. The first element is always `v1`.

For `t > 1`, the loop will fill in the `speeds` list up to the second last element, with the last element always being `v2`. The value of each element (except the first and the last) is determined by the minimum of the previous speed plus `d` and `v2` plus the product of `d` and the difference between `t` and the current index minus 1.

If `t` is 2 or more, `i` will be `t-1` after the loop finishes.

Therefore, considering all possible scenarios for `t` and how the `speeds` list is updated, we can conclude:

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and for `t > 1`, all other elements except the first and the last are determined by the loop's iterative calculation, `i` is `t-1` if `t` is greater than 1, otherwise, the loop does not execute and `speeds` remains a list with `v1` as its first and only element if `t` is 1.**
