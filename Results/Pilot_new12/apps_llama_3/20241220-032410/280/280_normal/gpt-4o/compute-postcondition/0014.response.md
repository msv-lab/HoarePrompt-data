The function `func` accepts parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. `v_1` and `v_2` are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive). However, the problem statement does not specify the return value of the function.
