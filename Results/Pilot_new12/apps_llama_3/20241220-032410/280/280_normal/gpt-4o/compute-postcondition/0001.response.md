The code updates the values of `t` and `d` using the `map` function, which applies the `int` function to the input values split by spaces. 

The value of `v1` and `v2` are not affected, so their values remain input integers.

`t` is updated to an input integer, and `d` is also updated to an input integer.

The previous constraint that `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive) is no longer valid, since `t` and `d` are now input integers.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
