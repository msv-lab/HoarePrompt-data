Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly for all cases because it does not consider the case when the speed of the car should decrease. In the current implementation, the speed is always increased by `d` until it reaches the maximum possible speed or the end speed `v2`. However, the speed should decrease when `v1` is greater than `v2`.

For example, if the input is `10 5` and `4 2`, the program will not work correctly because it will try to increase the speed from `10` to `5` by adding `d` in each step, which is not possible.

To fix this, the program should check whether the current speed should be increased or decreased to reach the end speed `v2`. If `v1` is greater than `v2`, the speed should be decreased; otherwise, it should be increased.

Here is an example of an incorrect case:

Input:
```
10 5
4 2
```
Expected output: `34` (one possible sequence of speeds is `10, 8, 7, 5`)
Actual output: `10 + 12 + 14 + 5 = 41` (which is incorrect because the speed is increased instead of decreased)
