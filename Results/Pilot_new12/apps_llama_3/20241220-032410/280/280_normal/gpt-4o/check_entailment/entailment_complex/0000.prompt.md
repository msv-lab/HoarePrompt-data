You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and d is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive), such that there exists a sequence of speeds where the speed in the first second equals v_1, the speed in the last second equals v_2, and the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and for `t > 1`, all other elements except the first and the last are determined by the loop's iterative calculation, `i` is `t-1` if `t` is greater than 1, otherwise, the loop does not execute and `speeds` remains a list with `v1` as its first and only element if `t` is 1.
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the total distance traveled by an object under the constraints of a given initial speed (`v1`), final speed (`v2`), time (`t`), and maximum acceleration/deceleration (`d`). The function takes these parameters as input from the user, where `v1` and `v2` are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive). It then determines a sequence of speeds over the given time period, with the first speed being `v1`, the last speed being `v2`, and the speed at each subsequent second not exceeding the previous speed plus `d`. The total distance traveled is the sum of all speeds in this sequence. The function prints the total distance traveled to the console, covering edge cases including when `t` equals 1, in which case the total distance is simply `v1`. However, it is worth noting that the function assumes that a valid sequence of speeds exists given the input parameters; it does not validate this assumption or handle cases where no such sequence exists. Additionally, the function does not explicitly validate the input parameters against the specified ranges, relying on the input provided by the user to adhere to these constraints.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
