Correctness: **False**

The given code does not handle all potential cases correctly. Specifically, the code calculates the speed at each second as `min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)`, which ensures that the speed does not exceed the maximum possible speed at the current time step. However, this formula does not guarantee that the absolute difference between the speeds of two adjacent seconds does not exceed `d` when `v2` is less than `v1`.

A counterexample is the input `10 8` for `v1` and `v2`, and `4 2` for `t` and `d`. In this case, the code will calculate the speeds as `[10, 12, 14, 12]`, which exceeds the maximum allowed absolute difference `d` between adjacent seconds.

To fix this, the code should also consider the minimum possible speed at each time step, ensuring that the absolute difference between the speeds of two adjacent seconds does not exceed `d` in both directions (i.e., both acceleration and deceleration). 

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t-1):
        speeds[i] = max(v1 + i * -d, min(v1 + i * d, v2 - (t - i - 1) * d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d))
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
```
However, even this corrected version might not guarantee the maximum possible length of the path in all cases, as the problem description asks for the maximum possible length of the path section in meters. The current implementation simply ensures that the absolute difference between the speeds of two adjacent seconds does not exceed `d`, but it does not necessarily find the maximum possible length.

To find the maximum possible length, a more complex algorithm involving dynamic programming or optimization techniques may be needed. The current implementation is an approximation and may not work correctly in all cases.
