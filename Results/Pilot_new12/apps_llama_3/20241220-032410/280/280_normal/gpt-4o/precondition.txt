v_1 and v_2 are positive integers between 1 and 100 inclusive, t is an integer between 2 and 100 inclusive, and d is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10 inclusive, such that there exists a sequence of speeds where the absolute difference between any two adjacent speeds does not exceed d and the first and last speeds are v_1 and v_2 respectively.
