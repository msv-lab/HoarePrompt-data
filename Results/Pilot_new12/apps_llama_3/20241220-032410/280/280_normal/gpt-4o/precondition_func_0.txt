v_1 and v_2 are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and d is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive), such that there exists a sequence of speeds where the speed in the first second equals v_1, the speed in the last second equals v_2, and the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d.
