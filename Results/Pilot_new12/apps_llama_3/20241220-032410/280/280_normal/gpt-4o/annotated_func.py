#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and d is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive), such that there exists a sequence of speeds where the speed in the first second equals v_1, the speed in the last second equals v_2, and the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and for `t > 1`, all other elements except the first and the last are determined by the loop's iterative calculation, `i` is `t-1` if `t` is greater than 1, otherwise, the loop does not execute and `speeds` remains a list with `v1` as its first and only element if `t` is 1.
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the total distance traveled by an object under the constraints of a given initial speed (`v1`), final speed (`v2`), time (`t`), and maximum acceleration/deceleration (`d`). The function takes these parameters as input from the user, where `v1` and `v2` are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive). It then determines a sequence of speeds over the given time period, with the first speed being `v1`, the last speed being `v2`, and the speed at each subsequent second not exceeding the previous speed plus `d`. The total distance traveled is the sum of all speeds in this sequence. The function prints the total distance traveled to the console, covering edge cases including when `t` equals 1, in which case the total distance is simply `v1`. However, it is worth noting that the function assumes that a valid sequence of speeds exists given the input parameters; it does not validate this assumption or handle cases where no such sequence exists. Additionally, the function does not explicitly validate the input parameters against the specified ranges, relying on the input provided by the user to adhere to these constraints.
