#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 <= v_1, v_2 <= 100, t is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, and d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= 10, and there exists a sequence of speeds for the car starting with v_1, ending with v_2, and changing by at most d between seconds, over the course of t seconds.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is determined by the iterative process starting from `max(v1, v2)` and adjusting by `d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is determined by the iterative process starting from `min(v1, v2)` and adjusting by `d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is the accumulation of `max_speed` over `t` iterations, and `min_length` is the accumulation of `min_speed` over `t` iterations. If `t` is 1 or less, the loop doesn't execute, and the initial values of `max_length`, `min_length`, `max_speed`, and `min_speed` based on `v1`, `v2`, and `t` prevail.
    print(max_length)
#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the maximum possible distance that can be traveled by a car over a given time period `t` seconds, with a maximum speed change of `d` between seconds, and given initial and final speeds `v1` and `v2`. The function takes no explicit parameters but instead reads `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` from user input. It initializes `max_speed` and `min_speed` based on `v1` and `v2`, and then iteratively adjusts these speeds and calculates the total distance traveled for both the maximum and minimum speed scenarios. The function handles edge cases where `t` is 1 or less by not executing the loop and using initial values for calculations. After execution, the function state reflects the calculated maximum distance based on the provided inputs, and this distance is printed out. The function does not validate the input ranges (1 <= `v1`, `v2` <= 100, 2 <= `t` <= 100, 0 <= `d` <= 10) but assumes they are correctly provided by the user.
