Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description correctly. The main issue with the program is that it incorrectly calculates the maximum possible length of the path section. 

The program starts with the maximum speed and minimum speed, then in each iteration, it updates the maximum and minimum speed by subtracting `d` from the maximum speed and adding `d` to the minimum speed, respectively. However, this approach does not guarantee that the absolute difference between the speeds of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed `d`.

For example, consider the case when `v1 = 10`, `v2 = 10`, `t = 10`, and `d = 0`. The program will output `190` instead of the correct answer `100`. This is because the program does not correctly handle the case when `d` is `0`, which means the speed remains constant throughout the journey.

Another issue with the program is that it uses the `max_speed` and `min_speed` variables to calculate the length of the path. However, these variables do not represent the actual speeds at each second. The program should calculate the actual speeds at each second and then calculate the length of the path.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to use a different approach. One possible approach is to use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum possible length of the path section for each second.

Here's an example of a correct solution:
```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    
    max_length = 0
    for i in range(t):
        if i == 0:
            speed = v1
        elif i == t - 1:
            speed = v2
        else:
            # calculate the maximum possible speed at this second
            speed = min(v1 + i * d, v2 - (t - i - 1) * d)
            
        max_length += speed
    
    print(max_length)
```
This solution calculates the maximum possible length of the path section by iterating over each second and calculating the maximum possible speed at that second. It then adds up the speeds at each second to get the total length of the path.
