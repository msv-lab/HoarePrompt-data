You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 <= v_1, v_2 <= 100, t is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, and d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= 10, and there exists a sequence of speeds for the car starting with v_1, ending with v_2, and changing by at most d between seconds, over the course of t seconds.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        
        max_length += max_speed
        
        min_length += min_speed
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is determined by the iterative process starting from `max(v1, v2)` and adjusting by `d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is determined by the iterative process starting from `min(v1, v2)` and adjusting by `d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is the accumulation of `max_speed` over `t` iterations, and `min_length` is the accumulation of `min_speed` over `t` iterations. If `t` is 1 or less, the loop doesn't execute, and the initial values of `max_length`, `min_length`, `max_speed`, and `min_speed` based on `v1`, `v2`, and `t` prevail.
    print(max_length)
#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates and prints the maximum possible distance that can be traveled by a car over a given time period `t` seconds, with a maximum speed change of `d` between seconds, and given initial and final speeds `v1` and `v2`. The function takes no explicit parameters but instead reads `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` from user input. It initializes `max_speed` and `min_speed` based on `v1` and `v2`, and then iteratively adjusts these speeds and calculates the total distance traveled for both the maximum and minimum speed scenarios. The function handles edge cases where `t` is 1 or less by not executing the loop and using initial values for calculations. After execution, the function state reflects the calculated maximum distance based on the provided inputs, and this distance is printed out. The function does not validate the input ranges (1 <= `v1`, `v2` <= 100, 2 <= `t` <= 100, 0 <= `d` <= 10) but assumes they are correctly provided by the user.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
