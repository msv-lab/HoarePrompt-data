Precondition: **v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 <= v_1, v_2 <= 100, t is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, and d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= 10, and there exists a sequence of speeds for the car starting with v_1, ending with v_2, and changing by at most d between seconds, over the course of t seconds.**
