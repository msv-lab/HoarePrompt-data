The value of `max_speed` is updated to be the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `max_speed` becomes `max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`, `min_speed` remains `min(v1, v2)`, `max_length` remains `max(v1, v2) * t`, `min_length` remains `min(v1, v2) * t`, `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `d` is an input integer, `i` is `t - 1`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `min_length` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `i` is `t - 1`**
