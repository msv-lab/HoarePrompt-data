To determine the output state of the loop, we should analyze how the loop modifies the variables `max_speed`, `min_speed`, `max_length`, and `min_length` over its iterations.

1. **`max_speed` and `min_speed`**: These are updated based on the previous values of `max_speed` and `min_speed` themselves, along with the input `d`. The updates are as follows:
   - `max_speed` becomes the maximum of `max_speed - d` and `min_speed`.
   - `min_speed` becomes the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`.

   Over iterations, `max_speed` decreases by at most `d` each time (if `max_speed - d` is greater than `min_speed`), and `min_speed` increases by at most `d` each time (if `min_speed + d` is less than `max_speed`). However, their values are interdependent, meaning the actual rate of change for both depends on the relationship between `max_speed` and `min_speed` at each iteration.

2. **`max_length` and `min_length`**: These accumulate the current values of `max_speed` and `min_speed` over the iterations, respectively. Initially, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, and `min_length` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`. Then, in each iteration:
   - `max_length` increases by the current `max_speed`.
   - `min_length` increases by the current `min_speed`.

Given the initial states and the updates, let's consider the overall effect of the loop:

- **If `t` is 1 or less**, the loop does not execute. Therefore, `max_speed` remains the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` remains the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` remains `max(v1, v2) * t`, and `min_length` remains `min(v1, v2) * t`.

- **If `t` is greater than 1**, the loop executes `t-1` times. Over these iterations, `max_speed` and `min_speed` adjust according to the rules provided, affecting how `max_length` and `min_length` accumulate.

Considering the accumulation of `max_length` and `min_length` and the adjustments of `max_speed` and `min_speed`, the final state after all iterations can be generalized as follows:

- `max_speed` and `min_speed` will have adjusted based on `d` and their initial values (which are functions of `v1` and `v2`), but their exact values after `t-1` iterations depend on the specifics of how `max_speed` and `min_speed` change relative to each other over the iterations.
- `max_length` and `min_length` will have accumulated the values of `max_speed` and `min_speed` over the iterations, starting from their initial values based on `v1`, `v2`, and `t`.

Given the iterative nature and interdependence of `max_speed` and `min_speed`, and without a closed-form solution provided for their evolution over `t-1` iterations, we emphasize the role of `t`, `d`, `v1`, and `v2` in determining the final state.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is determined by the iterative process starting from `max(v1, v2)` and adjusting by `d` and `min_speed`, `min_speed` is determined by the iterative process starting from `min(v1, v2)` and adjusting by `d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is the accumulation of `max_speed` over `t` iterations, and `min_length` is the accumulation of `min_speed` over `t` iterations. If `t` is 1 or less, the loop doesn't execute, and the initial values of `max_length`, `min_length`, `max_speed`, and `min_speed` based on `v1`, `v2`, and `t` prevail.**
