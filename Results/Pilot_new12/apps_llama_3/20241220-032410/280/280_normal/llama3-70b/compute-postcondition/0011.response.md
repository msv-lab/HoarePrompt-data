According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t - 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1, so `i` is `t - 2`. Since `i` is `t - 2`, `t` must be at least `t - 1 + 1` or simply `t` must be at least 3 for `i` to be `t - 2` and greater than 0, thus `t` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.


State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer and must be at least 3, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`, `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t + min_speed`, `i` is `t - 2`**
