To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides that:
- `v1` is an input integer,
- `v2` is an input integer,
- `t` is an input integer,
- `d` is an input integer,
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`,
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`.

The given code is:
```python
max_length = max_speed * t
```

This code assigns the product of `max_speed` and `t` to a new variable named `max_length`. Since `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, we can express `max_length` as the product of this maximum value and `t`.

Thus, the output state is:
- `v1` is an input integer,
- `v2` is an input integer,
- `t` is an input integer,
- `d` is an input integer,
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`,
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`,
- `max_length` is equal to `max_speed * t`, which means `max_length` equals the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`.**
