`min_length` is assigned the value of `min_speed` multiplied by `t`. The value of `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, and `t` is an input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`max_speed` is still the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, 
`min_speed` is still the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, 
`max_length` is still the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, 
`min_length` is `min_speed * t`.
Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `min_length` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`.**
