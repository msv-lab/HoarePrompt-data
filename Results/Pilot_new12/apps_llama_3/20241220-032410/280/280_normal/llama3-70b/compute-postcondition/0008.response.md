The code updates the value of `min_speed`. The new value of `min_speed` is the minimum of `min_speed + d` and `max_speed`. 

Given that `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, and `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, the new value of `min_speed` will be the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`.

The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`v1` is an input integer, 
`v2` is an input integer, 
`t` is an input integer and must be at least 2, 
`d` is an input integer, 
`max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, 
`min_speed` is the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed`, 
`max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, 
`min_length` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, 
`i` is `t - 1`.
Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `min_length` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `i` is `t - 1`**
