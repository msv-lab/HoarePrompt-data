To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `v1` is an input integer.
- `v2` is an input integer.
- `t` is an input integer and must be at least 4.
- `d` is an input integer.
- `max_speed` is calculated based on `v1`, `v2`, and `d`, and then updated.
- `min_speed` is the minimum of the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)` plus `d`, and `max_speed`.
- `max_length` and `min_length` are calculated based on `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, and `min_speed`.
- `i` is `t - 3`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
```

This line of code updates the value of `min_speed` to be the minimum between the current `min_speed` plus `d` and `max_speed`. 

Given the definitions:
- `max_speed` is `max(max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2)) - d, min(min(v1, v2) + d, max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))))` updated to `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)`.
- `min_speed` is initially the minimum of the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)` plus `d`, and `max_speed`.

After executing the code, `min_speed` is updated to `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i` remain unchanged because the code does not modify them. `max_speed` is also not directly modified by the given line of code, but its previous value was dependent on `min_speed`, which is now updated.

Therefore, the output state, considering the updates and the initial conditions that still apply, is:
- `v1` is an input integer.
- `v2` is an input integer.
- `t` is an input integer and must be at least 4.
- `d` is an input integer.
- `max_speed` is `max(max_speed - d, min_speed)` before the update of `min_speed`, and its relation to `min_speed` has been used in the initial calculation of `min_speed`.
- `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)` after the update.
- `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2)) + max(max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2)) - d, min(min(v1, v2) + d, max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))))`.
- `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t + 2 * min_speed`, where `min_speed` is now `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`.
- `i` is `t - 3`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer and must be at least 4, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed`'s relation to updated `min_speed` might need reassessment given `min_speed` is now `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2)) + max(max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2)) - d, min(min(v1, v2) + d, max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))))`, `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t + 2 * min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, and `i` is `t - 3`.**
