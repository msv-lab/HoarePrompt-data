The code snippet assigns `min_speed` the value of the minimum of `v1` and `v2`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, and `max_speed` are not affected. 

`max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`. The state of `max_speed` remains the same.

The states of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` are also not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`**
