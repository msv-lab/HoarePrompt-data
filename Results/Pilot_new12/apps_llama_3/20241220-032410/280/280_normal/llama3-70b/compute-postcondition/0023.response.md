The function `func` accepts parameters `v_1`, `v_2`, `t`, and `d`. `v_1` and `v_2` are integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `d` is an integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive). 

Given these constraints, the return value of the function is not explicitly stated in the problem. However, based on typical sequence and speed change problems, it could be related to determining whether such a sequence of speeds exists or calculating a specific aspect of this sequence.

Assuming the function's purpose is to validate or calculate a property of the sequence, we could consider the following possible cases for the return value:

1. A boolean indicating whether such a sequence exists.
2. The sequence of speeds itself.
3. An error message or exception if no valid sequence can be found under the given constraints.

Without the explicit output description, the best we can do is describe the input parameters based on the given constraints:

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters v_1, v_2, t, and d, where v_1 and v_2 are integers between 1 and 100, t is an integer between 2 and 100, and d is an integer between 0 and 10, likely to determine or calculate a property of a sequence of speeds from v_1 to v_2 over t seconds with a maximum speed change of d between seconds.**
