The values of `v1` and `v2` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user. The states of the other variables `t` and `d` are not affected. The sequence of speeds for the car remains the same, with `v_1` and `v_2` being replaced by the new values of `v1` and `v2`. The precondition that there exists a sequence of speeds for the car starting with `v_1`, ending with `v_2`, and changing by at most `d` between seconds, over the course of `t` seconds, may or may not still hold, depending on the input values. 

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, and `d` is an integer such that 0 <= d <= 10**
