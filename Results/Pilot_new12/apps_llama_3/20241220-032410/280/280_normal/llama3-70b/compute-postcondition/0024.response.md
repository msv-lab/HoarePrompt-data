Functionality: **This function calculates and prints the maximum possible distance that can be traveled by a car over a given time period `t` seconds, with a maximum speed change of `d` between seconds, and given initial and final speeds `v1` and `v2`. The function takes no explicit parameters but instead reads `v1`, `v2`, `t`, and `d` from user input. It initializes `max_speed` and `min_speed` based on `v1` and `v2`, and then iteratively adjusts these speeds and calculates the total distance traveled for both the maximum and minimum speed scenarios. The function handles edge cases where `t` is 1 or less by not executing the loop and using initial values for calculations. After execution, the function state reflects the calculated maximum distance based on the provided inputs, and this distance is printed out. The function does not validate the input ranges (1 <= `v1`, `v2` <= 100, 2 <= `t` <= 100, 0 <= `d` <= 10) but assumes they are correctly provided by the user.**
