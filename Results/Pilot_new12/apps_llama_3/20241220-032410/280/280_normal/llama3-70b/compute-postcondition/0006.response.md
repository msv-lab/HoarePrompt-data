According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is at least 2, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `min_length` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`. These states do not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `t` must be at least 2 and `i` is now `t - 1`.
State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `min_length` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`, `i` is `t - 1`**
