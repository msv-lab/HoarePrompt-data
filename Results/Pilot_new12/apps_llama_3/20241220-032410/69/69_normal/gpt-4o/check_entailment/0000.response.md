Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

One example where the program does not work correctly is when the target position can be reached by changing a subsegment of the operations in the middle of the sequence, but the program only checks for changes in the subsegments that end at the current position.

For instance, consider the sequence "UUUUUUUUUU" and the target position "(0, 0)". If we change the middle four operations to "DDDD", the resulting sequence "UUDDUUUU" reaches the target position, but the program will not find this solution.

To fix this issue, the program should check all possible subsegments of the operations, not just the ones that end at the current position. This can be done by using two nested loops to generate all possible subsegments and checking if changing each subsegment leads to a valid solution.

Here's a possible correction:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    for start in range(n):
        for end in range(start, n):
            new_ops = list(operations)
            current_x = 0
            current_y = 0
            for i in range(n):
                if i < start or i > end:
                    if operations[i] == 'U':
                        current_y += 1
