Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem. 

One issue with the code is that it only checks if the target position has been visited before, but it does not consider the case where the target position is reached later in the sequence.

Another issue is that the code does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. It only checks the distance between the current position and the target position when the target position is visited for the first time, but it does not consider the case where a shorter subsegment can be achieved by changing operations later in the sequence.

The code does not handle the case when the sequence of operations is not sufficient to reach the target position, which should return -1 according to the problem description.

For example, if we have a sequence of operations "UUUU" and the target position is (100, 100), the code should return -1, but it does not.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to check all possible subsegments of the sequence and calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the target position. If no such subsegment is found, we should return -1. 

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
5
UUUUU
1 1
The program will return 5 whereas the correct answer is -1 because it is not possible to reach (1,1) by changing some operations in "UUUUU". 

This is just an example of how the program does not work as expected. There might be other edge cases as well.
