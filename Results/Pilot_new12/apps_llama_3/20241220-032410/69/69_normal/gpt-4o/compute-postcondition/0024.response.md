Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 2. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is increased by 1. If `op` is neither 'L' nor 'R', `x` remains unchanged. `y` is an integer and its value does not change based on the given conditions.***
