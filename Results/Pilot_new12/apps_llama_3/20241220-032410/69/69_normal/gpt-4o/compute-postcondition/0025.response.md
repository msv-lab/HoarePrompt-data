Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 2, `x` and `y` are integers. If `op` is 'D', then `y` (referred to as `final_y` in the if part) is decreased by 1 from its initial value, and `x` remains unchanged. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is decreased by 1, and `y` remains unchanged. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is increased by 1, and `y` remains unchanged. If `op` is neither 'D', 'L', nor 'R', then both `x` and `y` remain unchanged.**
