The value of `min_length` is either the minimum distance the path crosses itself considering `dx` and `dy` or positive infinity. The program returns `min_length` if it is not positive infinity; otherwise, it returns -1. 

Output State: **The program returns the minimum distance the path crosses itself if it is not infinity; otherwise, it returns -1**
