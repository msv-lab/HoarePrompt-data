The value of `current_y` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, `operations` is still a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is still an integer, `y` is still an integer, `final_x` is still the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is still the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is still `x - final_x`, `dy` is still `y - final_y`, `target_pos` is still updated based on new `x`, `y`, `final_x`, and `final_y`, `position_map` is still updated with new positions, and `i` is still incremented by 1 to `i + 1`, with `n` remaining greater than `i + 1`. However, since `current_y` has been updated, `y` becomes `y - 1` because `current_y` is decreased by 1. Also `dy` becomes `dy - 1` as `dy` is `y - final_y` and `y` is decreased by 1, and `target_pos` is updated based on new `y` which is `y - 1`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is `y - 1`, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `dy - 1`, `target_pos` is updated based on new `x`, `y - 1`, `final_x`, and `final_y`, `position_map` is updated with new positions, and `i` is `i + 1`, with `n` remaining greater than `i + 1`**
