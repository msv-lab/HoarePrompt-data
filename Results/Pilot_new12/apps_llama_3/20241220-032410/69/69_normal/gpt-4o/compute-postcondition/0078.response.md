Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `target_pos` is `(current_x + x - final_x, current_y + y - final_y)`, `position_map` is a dictionary that initially contained {(0, 0): -1} and has been updated to include new positions. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` is the minimum of its previous value and `i - position_map[target_pos]`. Otherwise, `min_length` remains unchanged.**
