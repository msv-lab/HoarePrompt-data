The value of `final_x` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 0, the first character in the `operations` string, `op`, is 'L'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 0, `op` is 'L'**
