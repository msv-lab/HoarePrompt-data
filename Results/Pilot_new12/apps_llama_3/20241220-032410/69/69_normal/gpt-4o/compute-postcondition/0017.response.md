Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer. If the first character in the `operations` string, `op`, is 'U', then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is 1. If `op` is 'D', then `final_x` is 0 and `final_y` is -1. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is -1 and `final_y` is 0. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is 1 and `final_y` is 0.**
