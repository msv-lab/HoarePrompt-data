Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', if `operations[i]` is 'D', then `y` is decremented by 1 to `y - 1`, `dy` is updated to `dy - 1`, and `target_pos`, `position_map` are updated based on new `y` (`y - 1`), `x`, `final_x`, and `final_y`; otherwise, if `operations[i]` is 'L', then `x` is decremented by 1 to `x - 1`, `dx` is updated to `dx - 1` or `x - 1 - final_x`, and `target_pos`, `position_map` are updated based on new `x` (`x - 1`), `y`, `final_x`, and `final_y`; if `operations[i]` is 'R', then `x` is incremented by 1 to `x + 1`, `dx` is updated to `dx + 1` or `x + 1 - final_x`, and `target_pos`, `position_map` are updated based on new `x` (`x + 1`), `y`, `final_x`, and `final_y`; if `operations[i]` is 'U', then the state of `x`, `dx` remains unchanged, `y`, `final_x`, `final_y`, and `dy` remain unchanged; in all cases, `i` is incremented by 1 to `i + 1`, with `n` remaining greater than `i + 1`.**
