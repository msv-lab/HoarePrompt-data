Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` and `y` are integers, `i` is `i + 1`, `target_pos` is `(x, y)`, `final_x` and `final_y` are updated based on the counts of 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R' in `operations`, `dx` and `dy` are updated based on the new `x` and `y`, and `position_map` is updated accordingly. If `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` is `min(min_length, i - position_map[(x, y)])`.***
