The code updates the `position_map` dictionary by adding a new entry with the key as the current position `(current_x, current_y)` and the value as the current index `i`. 

The values of `n`, `operations`, `x`, `y`, `final_x`, `final_y`, `dx`, `dy`, and `target_pos` are not affected by this code. The `position_map` dictionary now includes the updated position `(current_x, current_y)` with its corresponding index `i`. 

The state of `min_length` is not affected in this step as its update is dependent on the condition `if target_pos is in position_map`, which is not executed in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `target_pos` is `(current_x + x - final_x, current_y + y - final_y)`, `position_map` is a dictionary that initially contained {(0, 0): -1} and has been updated to include new positions including `(current_x, current_y)` with index `i`.**
