Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0, the first character in the `operations` string, `op`, is not 'U', not 'D', and not 'L', which means the current value of `op` is 'R', and specifically, `op` equals 'R'**
