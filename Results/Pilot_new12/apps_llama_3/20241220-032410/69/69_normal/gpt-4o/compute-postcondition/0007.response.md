The value of `final_y` is decremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, the first character in the `operations` string, `op`, is not 'U' and the current value of `op` is 'D'.
