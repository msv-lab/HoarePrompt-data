To determine the output state after running the given Python code, let's analyze its impact on the variables defined in the initial state.

- `n` is a positive integer and at least 2.
- `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 2.
- `x` is an integer.
- `y` is an integer.

The given code snippet is:
```python
final_y -= 1
```
However, there seems to be a discrepancy in the variable names between the initial state and the code snippet. The initial state mentions `y`, but the code snippet refers to `final_y`. For the purpose of this analysis, we will assume that `final_y` is indeed the variable that is being operated on, and it is related to or perhaps a typo for `y` given in the initial state. If `final_y` is intended to be a distinct variable, its initial state should have been provided. 

Given this, the operation `final_y -= 1` decreases the value of `final_y` by 1. 

Since `final_y` was not directly mentioned in the initial state but assuming it could be related to `y`, we will consider the impact on `y` or introduce `final_y` as a new variable depending on the interpretation. 

If `final_y` is considered a new variable or a typo but intended to reflect a change on `y`, then `y` would be decreased by 1 if we were directly updating `y`. However, without a clear link between `final_y` and `y` in the provided initial state, we must treat `final_y` as a separate entity.

The output state, considering `final_y` as a separate variable (since its initial state was not provided and assuming it's not a direct operation on `y` due to the naming discrepancy), would be:

- `n` remains a positive integer and at least 2.
- `operations` remains a string of length `n` and at least 2.
- `x` remains an integer.
- `y` remains an integer (since the operation was on `final_y`, not directly on `y`).
- `final_y` is decreased by 1 from its unspecified initial value.

Thus, the output state, with the understanding that `final_y` is a distinct variable or the code intended to modify `y` but due to the naming will treat `final_y` separately, is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 2, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `final_y` is decreased by 1 from its initial value.**
