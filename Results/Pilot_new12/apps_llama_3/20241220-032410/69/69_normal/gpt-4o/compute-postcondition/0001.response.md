The given code assigns a value to the variable `final_y`. The variable `final_y` is assigned the value `0`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, and `final_y` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, and `final_y` is 0**
