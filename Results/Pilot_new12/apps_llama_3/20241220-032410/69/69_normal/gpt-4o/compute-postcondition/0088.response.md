Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `i + 1`, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` and `y` are integers, if `operations[i]` is 'U', then `y` is incremented by 1, `final_x` and `final_y` are updated based on the counts of 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R' in `operations`, `dx` and `dy` are updated based on the new `x` and `y`, and `target_pos` and `position_map` are updated accordingly; if `operations[i]` is 'D', then `y` is decremented by 1, `dy` is updated, and `target_pos` and `position_map` are updated based on the new `y`; if `operations[i]` is 'L', then `x` is decremented by 1, `dx` is updated, and `target_pos` and `position_map` are updated based on the new `x`; if `operations[i]` is 'R', then `x` is incremented by 1, `dx` is updated, and `target_pos` and `position_map` are updated based on the new `x`; in all cases, `i` is incremented by 1 to `i + 1`, with `n` remaining greater than `i + 1`.**
