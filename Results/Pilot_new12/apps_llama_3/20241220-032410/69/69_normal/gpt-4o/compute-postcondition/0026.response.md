Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 2, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer. If `op` is 'U', then either `y` is increased by 1 or `final_y` is increased by 1. If `op` is 'D', then `y` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'L', then `x` is decreased by 1. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is increased by 1. If `op` is neither 'U', 'D', 'L', nor 'R', then both `x` and `y` remain unchanged.***
