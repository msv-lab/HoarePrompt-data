The value of `final_x` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `final_x` was 0, so the new value of `final_x` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 1, `final_y` is 0, the first character in the `operations` string, `op`, is 'R'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 1, `final_y` is 0, `op` is 'R'**
