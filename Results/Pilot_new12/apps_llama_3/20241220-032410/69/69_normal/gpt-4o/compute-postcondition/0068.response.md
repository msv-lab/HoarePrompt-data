The code increments the value of `current_y` by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, 
`operations` is still a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', 
`x` is still an integer, 
`y` is still an integer, 
`final_x` is still the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, 
`final_y` is still the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, 
`dx` is still `x - final_x`, 
`dy` is still `y - final_y`, 
if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` is still a positive integer, otherwise `min_length` remains positive infinity, 
`position_map` is still a dictionary that initially contained {(0, 0): -1} and has been updated to include `(current_x, current_y): i` where `i` is 1, 
`i` is still 1, 
the current value of `target_pos` is still `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)` where `current_x` and `current_y` are determined by the character at index `i` in `operations`, 
either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, or both `dx` and `dy` are not equal to 0, 
`current_y` is now `current_y + 1` which is the new value of `current_y`.
