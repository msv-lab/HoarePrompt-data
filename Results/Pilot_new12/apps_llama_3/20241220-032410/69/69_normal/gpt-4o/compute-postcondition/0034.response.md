Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 3, `x` and `y` are integers. If `op` is 'D', then `final_y` is `final_y` - 1. If `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is one less than its previous value. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is increased by 1. For any other operation, the state of `x`, `y`, and other variables remains unchanged.***
