The variable `final_x` is incremented by 1. However, the initial state does not mention `final_x`, it mentions `x` and `y`. Assuming the code is referring to `x` as `final_x` (since `final_x` is not defined in the initial state), the value of `x` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 3, `x` is an integer increased by 1, `y` is an integer**
