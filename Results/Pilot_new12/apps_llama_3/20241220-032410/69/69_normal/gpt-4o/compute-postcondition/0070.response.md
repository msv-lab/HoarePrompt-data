The value of `current_x` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `current_x` was used to determine `target_pos` as `(current_x + dx, current_y + dy)`. Now, `target_pos` becomes `(current_x - 1 + dx, current_y + dy)`. Since `current_x` has changed, the value of `target_pos` also changes. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` is a positive integer, otherwise `min_length` remains positive infinity, `position_map` is a dictionary that initially contained {(0, 0): -1} and has been updated to include `(current_x - 1, current_y): i` where `i` is 1, `i` is 1, the current value of `target_pos` is `(current_x - 1 + dx, current_y + dy)` where `current_x - 1` and `current_y` are determined by the character at index `i` in `operations`, and either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, or both `dx` and `dy` are not equal to 0, and `current_x` is decreased by 1.
