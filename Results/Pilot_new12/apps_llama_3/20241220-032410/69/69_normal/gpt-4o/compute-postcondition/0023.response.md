Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 2, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer. If `op` is 'R', then `final_x` is its original value of `x` plus 1. If `op` is not 'R', then there is no change in `x`, `y`, or any other variables, but this case is not explicitly handled in the given code, implying that the state of `x`, `y`, and other variables remains unchanged when `op` is not 'R'***
