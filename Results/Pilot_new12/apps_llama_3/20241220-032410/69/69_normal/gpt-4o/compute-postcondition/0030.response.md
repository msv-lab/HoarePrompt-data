Since `final_x` is not mentioned in the initial state, it's assumed that it's a new variable or its value is not provided. However, we can still calculate its value based on the given code. The code `final_x -= 1` is equivalent to `final_x = final_x - 1`. But since we do not have any initial value for `final_x`, we can only express it as `final_x` is one less than its previous value.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is one less than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is one less than its previous value**
