According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `operations` string. If the string has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Since `n` is a positive integer and `operations` is a string of length `n`, it is guaranteed that `operations` has at least 1 character. Therefore, the loop will execute. 

Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `op` is the first character in the `operations` string, and the loop is about to execute. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0, `op` is the first character in the `operations` string**
