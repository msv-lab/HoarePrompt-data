The code snippet provided is `dy = y - final_y`. To calculate the result, we should consider the initial state and the changes made by the code.

In the initial state: 
- `n` is a positive integer, 
- `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', 
- `x` is an integer, 
- `y` is an integer, 
- `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, 
- `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, 
- `dx` is `x - final_x`.

After executing `dy = y - final_y`, 
- `dy` is assigned the value of `y - final_y`, 
- the value of `y` and `final_y` are used to compute `dy`, 
- `dy` is the difference between `y` and `final_y`, where `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is a positive integer, 
`operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', 
`x` is an integer, 
`y` is an integer, 
`final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, 
`final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, 
`dx` is `x - final_x`, 
`dy` is `y - final_y`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`**
