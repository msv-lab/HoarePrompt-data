Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, if `target_pos` is in `position_map`, then `min_length` is a positive integer, otherwise `min_length` remains positive infinity, `position_map` is a dictionary that initially contained {(0, 0): -1} and has been updated to include `(current_x, current_y): i` where `i` is 1, `i` is 1, if `operations[i]` is 'R', then the current value of `target_pos` is `(current_x + 1 + dx, current_y + dy)` where `current_x` and `current_y` are determined by the character at index `i` in `operations`, `current_x` is `current_x + 1`, `current_y` remains the same, and either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, or both `dx` and `dy` are not equal to 0***
