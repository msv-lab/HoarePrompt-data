Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'. The current value of `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' in `operations`, and the current value of `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' in `operations`. `x` is an integer and `y` is an integer. The current value of `dx` is `x - final_x` and equals 0, and the current value of `dy` is `y - final_y` and equals 0, meaning `x` equals `final_x` and `y` equals `final_y`.**
