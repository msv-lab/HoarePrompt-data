The variable `final_x` is decreased by 1. However, the initial state does not mention `final_x`, it mentions `x`. Assuming the code is referring to `x` as `final_x`, the value of `x` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 2, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 2, `x` is an integer decreased by 1, `y` is an integer**
