The value of `final_y` is incremented by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `final_y`. But, it does provide values for `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. Since `final_y` is not defined in the initial state, we can only say that `final_y` is increased by 1, but its initial value is unknown. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `final_y` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and at least 3, `operations` is a string of length `n` and at least 3, `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, and `final_y` is increased by 1**
