The value of `visited[x]` is set to `True`, where `x` is `data[data[1]] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `visited` is a list of `n` values where `visited[data[1] - 1]` is `True` and `visited[data[data[1]] - 1]` is `True`, and at least one other value in `visited` must be `False`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input with at least `n+1` elements, the standard input is consumed, `visited` is a list of `n` values where `visited[data[1] - 1]` is `True` and `visited[data[data[1]] - 1]` is `True`, and at least one other value in `visited` must be `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `cycle` is a list containing the values 0 and `data[1] - 1`, and `x` is `data[data[1]] - 1`**
