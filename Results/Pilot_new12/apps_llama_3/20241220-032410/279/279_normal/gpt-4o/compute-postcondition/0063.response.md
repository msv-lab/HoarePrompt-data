The code calculates the number of cycles in `cycles` where all elements are 0 in the corresponding index in `b`. This is done by summing up the number of cycles for which all elements `x` in the cycle satisfy the condition `b[x] == 0`.

The values of `n`, `p`, `b`, `data`, `visited`, and `cycles` are not modified by this code. A new variable `no_reverse_components` is introduced and assigned the calculated value.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers from the original `data[1]` to the original `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where all indices that were part of a detected cycle are `True`, `cycles` is a list of detected cycles, where each cycle is a list of indices that form a cycle, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of all cycles in `cycles` where all elements are 0 in the corresponding index in `b`.**
