Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers from the original `data[1]` to the original `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where all indices that were part of a detected cycle are `True`, `cycles` is a list of detected cycles, where each cycle is a list of indices that form a cycle, and `no_reverse_components` is the sum of all cycles in `cycles` where all elements are 0 in the corresponding index in `b`. The number of cycles in `cycles` is not equal to 1, meaning there are either no cycles or more than one cycle.**
