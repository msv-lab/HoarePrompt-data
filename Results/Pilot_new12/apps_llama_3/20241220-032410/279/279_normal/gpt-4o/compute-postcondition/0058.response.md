The value of `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1`. Since `x` is initially `p[old_x] - 1`, we substitute this into the new equation for `x` to get `x = p[p[old_x] - 1] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers from the original `data[1]` to the original `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `i` is 2, `cycle` is a list containing the values 2, the old value of `x`, and `x`, `x` is `p[p[old_x] - 1] - 1`, `visited` contains `True` for all indices in the updated `cycle` including `x`, `cycles` contains the updated cycles including the previous `cycle`**
