The provided code maps the string values from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]` to integers and assigns the result to `b`. 

`n` remains an integer equal to `int(data[0])`. 
`p` remains a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`. 
`data` remains a list of strings split from the standard input, and the standard input is still consumed.

The list `b` is updated to be a list of integers of length `n`, where each integer is either 0 or 1, since these values are being mapped from `data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input, and the standard input is consumed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input, and the standard input is consumed.**
