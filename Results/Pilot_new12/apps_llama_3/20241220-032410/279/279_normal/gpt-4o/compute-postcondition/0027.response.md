The code `cycle = []` assigns an empty list to the variable `cycle`. The previous value of `cycle` was a list of visited indices, but this is now reset to an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input with at least `n+1` elements, the standard input is consumed. If `visited[i]` is initially `False`, then `visited` contains at least one `True` value for each visited index, `cycles` is a list containing the previous `cycle` list of visited indices, `i` is 1, `cycle` is an empty list `[]`, and `x` is the index where the loop terminated. If `visited[i]` is initially `True`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
