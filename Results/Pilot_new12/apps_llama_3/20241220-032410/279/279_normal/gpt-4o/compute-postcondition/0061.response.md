Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers from the original `data[1]` to the original `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, if `visited[i-1]` was initially `False`, then `i` is 2, `cycle` contains a list of values that form a cycle, `x` is the index where the cycle was detected, `visited` contains `True` for all indices in the cycle, and `cycles` contains the updated cycles including the new cycle. If `visited[i-1]` was initially `True`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, except for `i` which is now 2.***
