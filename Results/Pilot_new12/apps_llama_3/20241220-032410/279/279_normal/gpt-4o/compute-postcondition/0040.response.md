The value of `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1`, where `x` is initially `p[x] - 1`. To calculate the new value of `x`, we substitute the initial value of `x` into the equation: `x = p[p[x] - 1] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `visited` contains at least one `True` value for each visited index with `visited[1]` being `True` and `visited[x]` being `True`, `cycles` is a list containing the previous cycle list of visited indices, `i` is 1, `cycle` is `[1, x, p[x] - 1]`, `x` is `p[p[x] - 1] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `visited` contains at least one `True` value for each visited index with `visited[1]` being `True` and `visited[x]` being `True`, `cycles` is a list containing the previous cycle list of visited indices, `i` is 1, `cycle` is `[1, x, p[x] - 1]`, `x` is `p[p[x] - 1] - 1`**
