The value of `n` is updated to be the integer value of the first element in the `data` list, which was initially a positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to the old value of `n`, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones of length equal to the old value of `n`, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input, and the standard input is consumed.**
