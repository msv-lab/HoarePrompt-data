Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers from the original `data[1]` to the original `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where all indices that were part of a detected cycle are `True`, `cycles` is a list of detected cycles, where each cycle is a list of indices that form a cycle. If `len(cycles)` is 1, the value 0 has been printed. Otherwise, `no_reverse_components` is either its current value if greater than 0 or 1, which has been returned.**
