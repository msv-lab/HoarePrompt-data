To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given while loop statement and the states at the end of the previous iteration.

The while loop statement is `while not visited[x]:`, which means the loop will continue to execute as long as `visited[x]` is `False`.

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than 0
- `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`
- `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones
- `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input with at least `n+1` elements
- The standard input is consumed
- `visited` is a list of `n` values where `visited[data[1] - 1]` is `True` and at least one other value must be `False`
- `cycles` is an empty list
- `i` is 0
- `cycle` is a list containing the values 0 and `data[1] - 1`
- `x` is `data[data[1]] - 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `visited[x]` must be `False`. Since `x` is `data[data[1]] - 1`, we need to ensure that `visited[data[data[1]] - 1]` is `False`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `visited[data[1] - 1]` is `True`, and at least one other value in `visited` must be `False`. However, there is no direct information about the value of `visited[data[data[1]] - 1]`. 

Since `x` is calculated based on `data[data[1]] - 1`, and for the loop to continue, `visited[x]` must be `False`, it implies that `data[data[1]] - 1` should not be equal to `data[1] - 1` (because `visited[data[1] - 1]` is already `True`), and `visited[data[data[1]] - 1]` must be `False`.

Thus, the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time are related to ensuring that `visited[x]` (which is `visited[data[data[1]] - 1]`) remains `False`, and that `x` (or `data[data[1]] - 1`) refers to an index in `visited` that is not yet `True`.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input with at least `n+1` elements, the standard input is consumed, `visited` is a list of `n` values where `visited[data[1] - 1]` is `True`, at least one other value in `visited` must be `False`, and specifically `visited[data[data[1]] - 1]` must be `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `cycle` is a list containing the values 0 and `data[1] - 1`, and `x` is `data[data[1]] - 1`**
