The value of `visited[x]` is updated to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so `n` is still an integer greater than 1, `p` is still a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is still a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is still a consumed list of strings, `cycles` is still a list containing the previous cycle list of visited indices, `i` is still 1, `cycle` is still `[1, x]`, and `x` is still `p[x] - 1`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `visited` contains at least one `True` value for each visited index with `visited[1]` being `True` and `visited[x]` being `True`, `cycles` is a list containing the previous cycle list of visited indices, `i` is 1, `cycle` is `[1, x]`, and `x` is `p[x] - 1`**
