The code `data = input().split()` reads a line from the standard input, splits it into a list of substrings separated by whitespace, and assigns this list to the variable `data`.

Given the initial state: `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones of length `n`, and `input` is the content of the standard input.

The states of `n`, `p`, and `b` are not affected by the code, but a new variable `data` is introduced, which is a list of strings split from the input. The value of `input` is consumed by the `input()` function, so its content is no longer available after this line.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input, and the standard input is consumed.**
