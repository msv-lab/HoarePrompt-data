Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input with at least `n+1` elements, the standard input is consumed, `visited` is a list of `n` values where the current value of `visited[i]` is `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, and `i` is 0, and the current value of `visited` at index `i` is not visited (i.e., `visited[i]` is `False`)**
