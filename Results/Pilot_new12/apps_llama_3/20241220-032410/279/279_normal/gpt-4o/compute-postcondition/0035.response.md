The value of `cycle` is updated by appending `x` to it. The states of the other variables are not affected. `cycle` initially contains `[1]`, and now it contains `[1, x]`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `visited` contains at least one `True` value for each visited index with `visited[1]` being `True` and `visited[x]` is now `True`, `cycles` is a list containing the previous cycle list of visited indices, `i` is 1, `cycle` is `[1, x]`, and `x` points to an index in `visited` that is now marked as visited**
