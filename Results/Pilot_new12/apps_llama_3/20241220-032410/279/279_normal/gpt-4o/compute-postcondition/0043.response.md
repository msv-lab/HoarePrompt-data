Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers from the original `data[1]` to the original `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `i` is 1. If `visited[i]` was initially `False`, then `x` is the index that caused the loop to terminate, `visited` contains `True` for all indices in `cycle`, `cycle` is the sequence of visited indices, and `cycles` contains the updated cycles including the current `cycle`. If `visited[i]` was initially `True`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
