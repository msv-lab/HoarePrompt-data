It appears that the function `func_1` is missing its parameters. Based on the provided parameter constraints, I will assume the function is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(n, p, b):
```
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `p`, and `b`. `n` is a positive integer, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones of length `n`. 

Unfortunately, without the output description, I can only describe the input parameters. If you provide the output description, I can complete the functionality description.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, p, and b, where n is a positive integer, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and b is a sequence of zeros and ones of length n.**
