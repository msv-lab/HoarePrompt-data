To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

The given code is:
```python
x = i
```

Given that `i` is 0, we can directly substitute this value into the code. 

So, `x` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer greater than 0, 
`p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, 
`b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, 
`data` is a list of strings split from the standard input with at least `n+1` elements, 
the standard input is consumed, 
`visited` is a list of `n` values where the current value of `visited[i]` is `False`, 
`cycles` is an empty list, 
`i` is 0, 
`cycle` is an empty list, 
`visited[i]` is `False`, 
and `x` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input with at least `n+1` elements, the standard input is consumed, `visited` is a list of `n` values where the current value of `visited[i]` is `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `cycle` is an empty list, `visited[i]` is `False`, and `x` is 0**
