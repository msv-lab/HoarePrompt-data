The given code `p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))` updates the value of `p` by mapping integers to the elements of `data` from index 1 to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is `int(data[0])`. 

Since `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` will now be a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`. The previous value of `p` being a permutation of integers from 1 to the old value of `n` is lost after this operation. The values of `b` and `data` remain unchanged as they are not involved in this operation. The standard input is still consumed.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones of length equal to the old value of `n`, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input, and the standard input is consumed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones of length equal to the value of `n`, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input, and the standard input is consumed.**
