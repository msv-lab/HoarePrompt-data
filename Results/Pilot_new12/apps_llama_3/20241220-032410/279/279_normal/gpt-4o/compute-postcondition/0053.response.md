The code `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the `cycle` list. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers from the original `data[1]` to the original `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `i` is 2, `cycle` is a list containing the values 2 and `x`, `x` corresponds to a now visited index, `visited` contains `True` for all indices in the updated `cycle`, `visited[2]` is `True`, `visited[x]` is `True`, `cycles` contains the updated cycles including the previous `cycle`**
