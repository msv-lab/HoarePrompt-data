The code `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the list `cycle`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`
- `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones
- `data` is a consumed list of strings
- `visited` contains at least one `True` value for each visited index with `visited[1]` being `True` and `visited[x]` being `True`
- `cycles` is a list containing the previous cycle list of visited indices
- `i` is 1
- `cycle` is `[1, x]`
- `x` is `p[x] - 1`

After executing `cycle.append(x)`, the list `cycle` will now be `[1, x, x]` or more specifically `[1, x, p[x] - 1]`, because `x` is equal to `p[x] - 1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer greater than 1, 
`p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, 
`b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, 
`data` is a consumed list of strings, 
`visited` contains at least one `True` value for each visited index with `visited[1]` being `True` and `visited[x]` being `True`, 
`cycles` is a list containing the previous cycle list of visited indices, 
`i` is 1, 
`cycle` is `[1, x, p[x] - 1]`, 
`x` is `p[x] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `visited` contains at least one `True` value for each visited index with `visited[1]` being `True` and `visited[x]` being `True`, `cycles` is a list containing the previous cycle list of visited indices, `i` is 1, `cycle` is `[1, x, p[x] - 1]`, `x` is `p[x] - 1`**
