The value of `visited[x]` is set to `True`. Given that `x` is 0, `visited[0]` becomes `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a list of strings split from the standard input with at least `n+1` elements, the standard input is consumed, `visited` is a list of `n` values where `visited[0]` is `True` and the rest of the values are `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `cycle` is an empty list, and `x` is 0**
