Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements described in the problem description. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. The program correctly reads the input from the standard input and parses it into three variables: `n`, a positive integer, `p`, a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and `b`, a sequence of zeros and ones of length `n`.

2. It then detects cycles in the permutation `p` by iterating over each element in `p` and following the cycle until it reaches a previously visited element. This is done correctly using the `visited` list to keep track of previously visited elements and the `cycles` list to store the detected cycles.

3. After detecting the cycles, the program counts the number of cycles where all elements have a corresponding value of 0 in `b`. This is done correctly using the `no_reverse_components` variable.

4. Finally, the program prints the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation `p` and the given sequence `b` that needs to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of the 2n placements. 

   - If there is only one cycle, it prints 0 because a single cycle can visit all positions in both directions without any changes. 
   
   - If there are multiple cycles, it prints the count of cycles without any 1s in their corresponding `b` values if such cycles exist, or 1 if no such cycles exist. This is because changing one element in `b` from 0 to 1 in each cycle without any 1s will allow that cycle to visit all positions in both directions.

Therefore, the program correctly solves the problem described and meets all the requirements.
