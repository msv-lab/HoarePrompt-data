You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))
    b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)
                x = p[x] - 1
            cycles.append(cycle)
    no_reverse_components = sum((all((b[x] == 0 for x in cycle)) for cycle in cycles))
    if len(cycles) == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(no_reverse_components if no_reverse_components > 0 else 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and works as expected. It correctly implements the necessary logic to determine the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.

Here is a brief explanation of why the program is correct:

* The program first reads the input data, including the number of skewers `n`, the permutation `p`, and the sequence `b`.
* It then initializes a `visited` list to keep track of the visited skewers and a `cycles` list to store the cycles in the permutation.
* The program then iterates over the skewers and finds the cycles in the permutation using a depth-first search approach.
* It calculates the number of cycles with no reversals (`no_reverse_components`) by checking if all skewers in each cycle have a `b` value of 0.
* Finally, the program prints the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed. If there is only one cycle, no changes are needed. Otherwise, it prints the number of cycles with no reversals if it is greater than 0, or 1 if all cycles have reversals.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the examples provided. It correctly identifies the minimum number of changes needed to ensure that every skewer visits each of 2n placements.

Note that the program's logic is based on the fact that if a cycle has no reversals, it means that the skewers in that cycle will not visit all 2n placements. By changing the `b` value of one skewer in each such cycle, we can ensure that the skewers in that cycle visit all 2n placements. If all cycles have reversals, we only need to change one element of the permutation or the `b` sequence to ensure that the skewers visit all 2n placements.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, p is a permutation of integers from 1 to n, and b is a sequence of zeros and ones of length n.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))
    b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)
                x = p[x] - 1
            cycles.append(cycle)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers from the original `data[1]` to the original `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where all indices that were part of a detected cycle are `True`, and `cycles` is a list of detected cycles, where each cycle is a list of indices that form a cycle.
    no_reverse_components = sum(all(b[x] == 0 for x in cycle) for cycle in cycles)
    if (len(cycles) == 1) :
        print(0)
    else :
        print(no_reverse_components if no_reverse_components > 0 else 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `p` is a list of integers from the original `data[1]` to the original `data[n]`, `b` is a list of `n` zeros and ones, `data` is a consumed list of strings, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where all indices that were part of a detected cycle are `True`, `cycles` is a list of detected cycles, where each cycle is a list of indices that form a cycle. If `len(cycles)` is 1, the value 0 has been printed. Otherwise, `no_reverse_components` is either its current value if greater than 0 or 1, which has been returned.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input from the standard input, parses it into three variables: `n`, a positive integer, `p`, a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and `b`, a sequence of zeros and ones of length `n`. It then detects cycles in the permutation `p` and counts the number of cycles where all elements have a corresponding value of 0 in `b`. If there is only one cycle, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the count of cycles without any 1s in their corresponding `b` values if such cycles exist, or 1 if no such cycles exist. The function modifies the state of the program by consuming the input, calculating and storing intermediate values, and printing the result, but it does not modify the input data itself. It handles cases where the input permutation may contain any number of cycles, including the edge case where there is only one cycle. The function does not perform any error handling on the input data, so it assumes that the input will always be in the correct format.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description.
