You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Pavel cooks barbecue. There are n skewers, they lay on a brazier in a row, each on one of n positions. Pavel wants each skewer to be cooked some time in every of n positions in two directions: in the one it was directed originally and in the reversed direction.

Pavel has a plan: a permutation p and a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n}, consisting of zeros and ones. Each second Pavel move skewer on position i to position p_{i}, and if b_{i} equals 1 then he reverses it. So he hope that every skewer will visit every position in both directions.

Unfortunately, not every pair of permutation p and sequence b suits Pavel. What is the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements? Note that after changing the permutation should remain a permutation as well.

There is no problem for Pavel, if some skewer visits some of the placements several times before he ends to cook. In other words, a permutation p and a sequence b suit him if there is an integer k (k ≥ 2n), so that after k seconds each skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

It can be shown that some suitable pair of permutation p and sequence b exists for any n.


-----Input-----

The first line contain the integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^5) — the number of skewers.

The second line contains a sequence of integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{n} (1 ≤ p_{i} ≤ n) — the permutation, according to which Pavel wants to move the skewers.

The third line contains a sequence b_1, b_2, ..., b_{n} consisting of zeros and ones, according to which Pavel wants to reverse the skewers.


-----Output-----

Print single integer — the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b he needs to change so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements.


-----Examples-----
Input
4
4 3 2 1
0 1 1 1

Output
2

Input
3
2 3 1
0 0 0

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2.

In the second example Pavel can change any element of b to 1.
Program:
```
func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    p = list(map(int, data[1:n + 1]))
    b = list(map(int, data[n + 1:2 * n + 1]))
    visited = [False] * n
    cycles = []
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle = []
            x = i
            while not visited[x]:
                visited[x] = True
                cycle.append(x)
                x = p[x] - 1
            cycles.append(cycle)
    no_reverse_components = sum((all((b[x] == 0 for x in cycle)) for cycle in cycles))
    if len(cycles) == 1:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(no_reverse_components if no_reverse_components > 0 else 1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program seems to be correct and working as per the problem description. The program calculates the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation p and the given sequence b that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of 2n placements. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:
- The program correctly identifies the cycles in the permutation p by iterating over each element and checking if it has been visited before. If it has not been visited, it creates a new cycle and adds the current element to it.
- It then checks if all elements in a cycle have the same value in the sequence b (i.e., all 0 or all 1). If a cycle has all 0s, it means that the skewers in that cycle will not be reversed, and thus will not visit all 2n placements.
- The program correctly counts the number of such cycles with all 0s (no_reverse_components).
- If there is only one cycle, the program prints 0, as no changes are needed to ensure that all skewers visit all 2n placements.
- Otherwise, the program prints the number of cycles with all 0s, if there are any. If there are no such cycles, it prints 1, indicating that at least one change is needed to ensure that all skewers visit all 2n placements.

The program seems to handle all possible cases correctly, including when there are multiple cycles, when there are cycles with all 0s or all 1s, and when there is only one cycle. Without a specific counterexample where the program does not work as expected, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads input from the standard input, parses it into three variables: `n`, a positive integer, `p`, a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`, and `b`, a sequence of zeros and ones of length `n`. It then detects cycles in the permutation `p` and counts the number of cycles where all elements have a corresponding value of 0 in `b`. If there is only one cycle, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the count of cycles without any 1s in their corresponding `b` values if such cycles exist, or 1 if no such cycles exist. The function modifies the state of the program by consuming the input, calculating and storing intermediate values, and printing the result, but it does not modify the input data itself. It handles cases where the input permutation may contain any number of cycles, including the edge case where there is only one cycle. The function does not perform any error handling on the input data, so it assumes that the input will always be in the correct format.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
