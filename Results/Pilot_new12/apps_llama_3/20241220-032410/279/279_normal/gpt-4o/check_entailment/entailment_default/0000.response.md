Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct. It follows the problem description by detecting cycles in the permutation `p` and counting the number of cycles where all elements have a corresponding value of 0 in `b`. If there is only one cycle, it prints 0; otherwise, it prints the count of cycles without any 1s in their corresponding `b` values if such cycles exist, or 1 if no such cycles exist. The code handles cases where the input permutation may contain any number of cycles, including the edge case where there is only one cycle.

The output hints also agree with the code and provide insight into its functionality. The code assumes that the input will always be in the correct format, which is a valid assumption according to the problem description.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For instance, in the first example, the code correctly outputs 2, as Pavel can change the permutation to 4, 3, 1, 2 to satisfy the condition. In the second example, the code correctly outputs 1, as Pavel can change any element of `b` to 1 to satisfy the condition.

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the required functionality and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
