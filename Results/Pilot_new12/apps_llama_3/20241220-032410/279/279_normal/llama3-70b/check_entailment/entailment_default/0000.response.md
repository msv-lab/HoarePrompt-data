Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem described. It simply counts the number of elements in `p` that do not match their 1-indexed position and the number of zeros in `b`, but this does not necessarily give the minimum number of changes needed to make the permutation and sequence suitable for Pavel's barbecue cooking.

For example, consider the input:

```
4
4 3 2 1
0 0 0 1
```

In this case, the code will output `5`, but the correct answer is `1`. The permutation `p` is a cycle of length 4, and the sequence `b` has one 1, which means that each skewer will visit each of the 4 positions in both directions after 8 seconds, if we change one element of `b` to 0 is not needed since there is one 1 in the sequence. The issue here is that the code does not take into account the actual cycle structure of the permutation and the effect of the sequence `b` on the reversal of the skewers.

Therefore, the code is not correct, and there are cases where it does not work as expected according to the problem description.
