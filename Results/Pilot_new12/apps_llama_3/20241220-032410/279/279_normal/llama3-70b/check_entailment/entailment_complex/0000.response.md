Correctness: **False**

The program is not correct because it does not accurately calculate the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation `p` and the given sequence `b` that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of the `2n` placements.

The program simply counts the number of elements in `p` that are not in their 1-indexed position and the number of zeros in `b`, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. 

The problem statement requires that the permutation `p` should remain a permutation after changing, and the sequence `b` should be changed such that every skewer will visit each of the `2n` placements. The program does not consider these requirements and does not accurately calculate the minimum number of changes required.

A correct approach to solve this problem would be to check if the permutation `p` contains a cycle and if the sequence `b` contains an odd number of ones. If the permutation `p` contains a cycle, it needs to be broken by changing one element. If the sequence `b` contains an even number of ones, one element in `b` needs to be changed to make it odd. 

For example, if the input is:
```
3
2 3 1
0 0 0
```
The program will output `6`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `1`, because we can change any element of `b` to `1` to make it odd, and the permutation `p` already contains a cycle. 

Therefore, the program does not accurately follow the problem description and does not correctly calculate the minimum total number of elements that need to be changed.
