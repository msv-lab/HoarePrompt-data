Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not accurately solve the problem as described. The task requires finding the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation `p` and the given sequence `b` that need to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of the `2n` placements. However, the code simply counts the number of elements in `p` that do not match their 1-indexed position and the number of zeros in `b`, which does not necessarily lead to the minimum changes required to satisfy the condition.

For example, consider the case where `n = 4`, `p = [4, 3, 2, 1]`, and `b = [0, 1, 1, 1]`. The code would output `4` because it counts the mismatches in `p` and the zeros in `b`. However, as mentioned in the problem description, Pavel can change the permutation to `[4, 3, 1, 2]`, which requires only `2` changes, not `4`.

A correct approach would involve analyzing the cycles in the permutation and determining the minimum changes needed to ensure that the skewers visit all `2n` placements. This might involve identifying the cycles in `p`, checking if there is at least one `1` in `b` that affects each cycle, and based on that, calculating the minimum number of changes required. The current implementation does not cover these steps and thus does not provide a correct solution for every potential case.
