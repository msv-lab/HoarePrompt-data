Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution to the problem described. Here's why:

1. The problem asks to find the minimum total number of elements in the given permutation `p` and the given sequence `b` that needs to be changed so that every skewer will visit each of the `2n` placements.

2. The program currently increments the answer `ans` whenever `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` or `b[i]` is `0`. However, this approach does not consider the actual goal of the problem.

3. The program does not check if the given permutation `p` is a valid permutation, i.e., if it is a bijection from the set of numbers `1` to `n` to itself. The program also does not consider the reversals of the skewers caused by the sequence `b`.

4. A correct approach would involve checking the cycles of the permutation `p` and the number of `1`s in the sequence `b`. If the permutation `p` has more than one cycle, or if the number of `1`s in the sequence `b` is even, then changes need to be made to `p` or `b` to ensure that every skewer visits each of the `2n` placements.

Here's a basic idea of how the correct program could be structured:

- First, count the number of `1`s in the sequence `b`. If this number is even, then at least one `0` needs to be changed to a `1` to make the number of `1`s odd.
- Next, analyze the cycles of the permutation `p`. If `p` has more than one cycle, then changes need to be made to `p` to merge these cycles into a single cycle.

Here's a revised version of the program that implements the correct approach:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    p = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = list(map(int, input().split()))

    # Check the number of 1s in the sequence b
    num_ones = sum(b)
    if num_ones % 2 == 0:
        num_changes = 1
    else:
        num_changes = 0

    # Analyze the cycles of the permutation p
    visited = [False] * n
    num_cycles = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            num_cycles += 1
            current = i
            while not visited[current]:
                visited[current] = True
                current = p[current] - 1

    # If p has more than one cycle, changes need to be made
    num_changes += num_cycles - 1

    print(num_changes)
```
