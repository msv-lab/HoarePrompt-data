The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. Initially, if the current value of `p` at index `i` is not equal to `i + 1`, then the current value of `ans` is 1. After incrementing by 1, `ans` will be 2 in this case. However, if `p` at index `i` equals `i + 1`, the initial value of `ans` is 0 (since it's not explicitly stated as 1), so `ans` will be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 0, the current value of `b` at index `i` is 0, and if the current value of `p` at index `i` is not equal to `i + 1`, then the current value of `ans` is 2, otherwise `ans` is 1.**
