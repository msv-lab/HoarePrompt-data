The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a new list of integers to `b`, which is generated by splitting the input string into substrings separated by whitespace, converting each substring to an integer, and storing them in a list. 

The length of `b` is now equal to the number of input integers. The initial state mentioned that the length of `b` was initially equal to the old value of `n`, but this length has now been updated based on the new input.

The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this code snippet. The list `p` also remains unchanged as there is no operation performed on it.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers generated by the input string.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers**
