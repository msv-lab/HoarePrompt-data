The value of `p` is updated to a new list of integers, which is created by mapping the `int` function to the input split by spaces. The old value of `p` is discarded. The length of the new `p` is equal to the number of integers in the input. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, where the length of `p` and `b` was initially equal to the old value of `n`, but now the length of `p` is the number of input integers and the length of `b` is still equal to the old value of `n`.**
