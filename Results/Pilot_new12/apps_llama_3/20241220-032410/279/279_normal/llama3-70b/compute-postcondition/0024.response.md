Functionality: **The function takes no parameters but reads three inputs from the user: an integer `n` and two lists of integers `p` and `b` of length `n`. It calculates and returns the total count of two types of mismatches: the number of elements in `p` that do not match their 1-indexed position (`p[i]!= i + 1`) and the number of zeros in the list `b`. The final state of the program is that it prints this total count to the console, effectively providing a measure of discrepancy between the list `p` and the expected sequence, as well as the prevalence of zeros in the list `b`.**
