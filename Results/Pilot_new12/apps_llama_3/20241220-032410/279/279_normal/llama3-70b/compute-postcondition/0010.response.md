Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 0. If `b[i]` is 0 and the current value of `p` at index `i` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is 2; if `b[i]` is 0 and the current value of `p` at index `i` is equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is 1; if `b[i]` is not 0, the state of `ans` remains as initially set, which is 1 when the current value of `p` at index `i` is not equal to `i + 1`.**
