The code `print(ans)` simply prints the value of `ans` to the console. This operation does not change the values of any variables. 

The value of `ans` remains the sum of the number of times `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and the number of times `b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in the range of `n`. The values of `n`, `p`, and `b` are also unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `ans` is the sum of the number of times `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and the number of times `b[i]` is 0 for all `i` in the range of `n`, and `ans` has been printed to the console.**
