To determine the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and the impact of the given code snippet.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer greater than 2.
- `p` is a list of input integers.
- `b` is a list of input integers.
- `i` is 2.

The code snippet is:
```python
ans += 1
```

Given this information, the code increments the value of `ans` by 1. However, the initial state does not provide a value for `ans`. Therefore, we can only conclude that `ans` has been incremented by 1 from its previous value, but we cannot determine its new value without knowing its initial value.

The states of `n`, `p`, `b`, and `i` are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 2, and `ans` is increased by 1 from its previous value.**
