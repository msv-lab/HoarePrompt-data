The code increments `ans` by 1. The initial state of `ans` is increased by 1 from its previous value if `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`. However, we do not know the exact value of `ans` because we do not know if `p[i]` is equal to `i + 1` or not. But we are increasing `ans` by 1 in any case. So, the new value of `ans` is the previous value of `ans` (which is increased by 1 from its previous value if `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`) plus 1.

Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 2. If `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then the previous value of `ans` is increased by 1 from its previous value, and now `ans` is increased by 1 from that value.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 2, `ans` is the previous value of `ans` (which is increased by 1 if `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`) plus 1**
