Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1. If `b[1]` is 0, then `ans` is increased by 1 from its previous value which was increased by 1 if `p[1]` is not equal to 2. If `b[1]` is not 0, then the state remains unchanged from the precondition, with `ans` increased by 1 if `p[1]` is not equal to 2.***
