The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `ans` was increased by 1 if `p[i]` was not equal to `i + 1`, but since `i` is still 1, `p[i]` is still `p[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `i` is 1, and `ans` is increased by 1 from its previous value which was increased by 1 if `p[1]` is not equal to 2**
