The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `p`, and `b`. `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5. `p` is a list of integers where each element p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= n. `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, where the length of `p` and `b` is equal to `n`. 

However, since the function definition provided is `def func():`, it does not explicitly accept any parameters. Therefore, based on the given information, it seems there might be a discrepancy between the function definition and the parameter descriptions.

Given the output section is empty, I will provide a general description based on the parameters provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, p, and b, where n is an integer, p is a list of integers, and b is a list of binary integers, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
