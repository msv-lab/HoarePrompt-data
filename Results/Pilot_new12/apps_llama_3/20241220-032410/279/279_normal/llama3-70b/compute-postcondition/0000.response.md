The code `n = int(input())` overwrites the existing value of `n` with a new integer value from the input.

The initial state of `n` was an integer such that 1 <= n <= 2*10^5. However, this value is lost after the execution of the code, and `n` becomes an input integer. 

The states of the other variables, `p` and `b`, are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a list of integers where each element p_i is an integer such that 1 <= p_i <= the old value of `n`, and `b` is a list of integers consisting of zeros and ones, where the length of `p` and `b` is equal to the old value of `n`.**
