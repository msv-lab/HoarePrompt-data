To calculate the result, let's analyze the given code step by step.

The code calculates `max_jump` as the maximum of its current value and the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.

Given that `i` is 2, the expression `(i - last_vowel)` will result in `2 - last_vowel`, which can be either positive, negative, or zero depending on the value of `last_vowel`. 

However, since we are dividing by 2 and adding 1, if `last_vowel` is greater than 2, `(i - last_vowel)` will be negative, and `(i - last_vowel) // 2` will be rounded down to the nearest whole number (which will be a negative number or zero), and then adding 1 will result in either zero or a negative number plus one. But since we are taking the maximum of this value and `max_jump`, if the result of the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` is less than `max_jump`, `max_jump` will remain unchanged.

If `last_vowel` is 2 or less, `(i - last_vowel)` will be either zero or positive, so `(i - last_vowel) // 2` will be zero or positive, and `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` will also be positive. In this case, `max_jump` could potentially increase.

Since we do not have specific values for `last_vowel` and `max_jump`, we can only conclude that `max_jump` will be the maximum of its current value and `(2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, and if the character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` may have changed, otherwise the state of `last_vowel` is unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, if the character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` may have changed, otherwise the state of `last_vowel` is unchanged.**
