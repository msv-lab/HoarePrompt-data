To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop iterates over the string `s` and checks if the current character is a vowel. If it is, it updates `max_jump` and `last_vowel`. 

- If `last_vowel` is -1 (meaning this is the first vowel encountered), `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. This essentially sets `max_jump` to the position of the first vowel in the string plus one.
- If `last_vowel` is not -1 (meaning this is not the first vowel encountered), `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. This calculates the maximum jump between two vowels and updates `max_jump` accordingly.

`last_vowel` is updated to the current index `i` whenever a vowel is encountered.

After all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `s` remains a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` remains 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` remains the length of `s`, which is greater than 0 since `s` is non-empty.
- `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop iterates `n` times, and `i` takes values from 0 to `n - 1`.
- The value of `last_vowel` will be the index of the last vowel in the string, or -1 if no vowels are found. However, given that `last_vowel` is updated only when a vowel is encountered, if there are no vowels, `last_vowel` remains -1.
- The value of `max_jump` will be the maximum jump between any two vowels in the string plus one, or the position of the first vowel plus one if only one vowel is present. If no vowels are present, `max_jump` remains 0, as it is initialized.

Considering all possible scenarios, including the case when the loop does not execute (which does not apply here since `s` is non-empty and the loop will execute at least once), we have:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowel is found, `max_jump` is the maximum jump between any two vowels in `s` plus one, or the position of the first vowel plus one if only one vowel is present, or 0 if no vowels are present.**
