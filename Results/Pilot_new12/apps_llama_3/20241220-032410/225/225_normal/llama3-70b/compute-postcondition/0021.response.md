The code `max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)` updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 1` equals 3. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and 3, if the character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` may have changed before this step, otherwise the state of `last_vowel` is unchanged**
