The code updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value (2) and the sum of `i` (1) and 1. 

`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, 
`vowels` is 'AEIOUY', 
`n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, 
`i` is 1, 
if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1 and 
`max_jump` is the maximum of 2 and `i` + 1 which is the maximum of 2 and 2, so `max_jump` becomes 2. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, 
`vowels` is 'AEIOUY', 
`n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, 
`i` is 1, 
if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1 and 
`max_jump` is 2.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, if the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1 and `max_jump` is 2**
