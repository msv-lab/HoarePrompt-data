Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, the current value of `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowel is found, `max_jump` is the maximum jump between any two vowels in `s` plus one, or the position of the first vowel plus one if only one vowel is present, or 0 if no vowels are present. The current value of `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, meaning the last vowel in `s` is not at the last position of the string.**
