The `print(max_jump)` statement only prints the value of `max_jump` to the console and does not modify any variables. 
The value of `max_jump` can be affected by the previous operations based on the conditions provided. If the last character of `s` is not a vowel, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `max_jump` remains unchanged. However, since the print statement itself does not change any variable values, the output state after this print statement will still include the same variables with their last updated values before the print statement.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowel is found, and `max_jump` is either its previous value or the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` depending on whether the last character of `s` is a vowel or not, and the value of `max_jump` has been printed.**
