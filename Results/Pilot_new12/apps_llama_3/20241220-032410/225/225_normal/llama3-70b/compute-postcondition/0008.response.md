To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the variables. The code `max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)` updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and `i + 1`. Given that `max_jump` is initially 0 and `i` is 0, `max_jump` will be updated to `max(0, 0 + 1) = max(0, 1) = 1`.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0.
- `max_jump` is initially 0.
- The initial value of `last_vowel` was -1, and the current value of `last_vowel` is still -1.
- `i` is 0.
- The current character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel.

Given that `i` is 0 and the character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel, and considering the update of `max_jump`, the other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel**
