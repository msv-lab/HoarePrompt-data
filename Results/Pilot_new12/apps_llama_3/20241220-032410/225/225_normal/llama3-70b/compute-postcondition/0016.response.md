To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- If the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1 and `max_jump` is 2.

Given the code: 
```python
max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
```

Since `i` is 1 and `last_vowel` is 1 (because the condition specifies that if the current character at index `i` is a vowel, then `last_vowel` is 1), we substitute these values into the equation:

`max_jump` = max(2, (1 - 1) // 2 + 1) = max(2, 0 // 2 + 1) = max(2, 0 + 1) = max(2, 1) = 2.

Therefore, `max_jump` remains 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. 

The output state is: 
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1.
- `i` is 1.
- `last_vowel` is 1.
- `max_jump` is 2.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 1, `max_jump` is 2**
