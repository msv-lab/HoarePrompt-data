The code `n = len(s)` assigns the length of the string `s` to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a non-empty string with a length not exceeding 100, `n` will be a positive integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100)**
