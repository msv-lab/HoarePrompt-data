Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowel is found. If the last character of `s` is not a vowel, then `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `max_jump` remains unchanged.***
