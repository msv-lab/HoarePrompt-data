The code updates the value of `last_vowel` to be equal to `i`. Since `i` is 0, `last_vowel` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Now, we need to update `max_jump` according to the new value of `last_vowel`. If `last_vowel` is -1, then `max_jump` is 1. Otherwise, `max_jump` is the maximum of 0 and `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Since `last_vowel` is 0, `max_jump` becomes the maximum of 0 and `(0 // 2) + 1`, which is 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel, `last_vowel` is 0, and `max_jump` is 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel, `last_vowel` is 0, and `max_jump` is 1**
