The value of `last_vowel` is updated to the current value of `i`, which is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 2, if `max_jump` was previously calculated when `last_vowel` was -1, then it remains the maximum of its previous value and 3, otherwise `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(2 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` which now equals `(2 - 2) // 2 + 1 = 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 2, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and 1**
