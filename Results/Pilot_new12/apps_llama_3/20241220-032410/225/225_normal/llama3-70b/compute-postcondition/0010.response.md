Since `i` is 0 and `last_vowel` is not equal to -1, let's calculate the new value of `max_jump`. The expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` will be `(0 - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, which is `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. 

Since `last_vowel` is not equal to -1 and is an index, it must be a non-negative integer. When we divide a negative number by 2 and take the integer part, we get the integer division of the negative number by 2, which will be a negative or zero integer.

However, `max_jump` will take the maximum value between its current value and `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Given that `max_jump` is initially 0, if `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1` is greater than 0, `max_jump` will be updated. Otherwise, it will remain 0.

The other variables are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `max_jump` is the maximum of 0 and `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, `last_vowel` is not equal to -1, `i` is 0, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `max_jump` is the maximum of 0 and `(-last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, `last_vowel` is not equal to -1, `i` is 0, and the current character at index `i` in string `s` is a vowel**
