The code updates the value of `last_vowel` to be equal to `i`. Given that `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is now 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `last_vowel` is 1, `max_jump` is 2**
