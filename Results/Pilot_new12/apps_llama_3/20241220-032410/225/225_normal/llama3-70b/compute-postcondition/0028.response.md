The code updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. This means `max_jump` will be at least as large as it was before, and potentially larger if the new expression evaluates to a larger value.

Given that `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, and `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowel is found, the new value of `max_jump` depends on the current value of `last_vowel` and `n`.

Since `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, the last vowel in `s` is not at the last position of the string. The expression `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` calculates half the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string, plus one.

Considering all the information, the output state after executing the given code snippet is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowel is found, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`**
