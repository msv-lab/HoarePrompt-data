You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day, the Grasshopper was jumping on the lawn and found a piece of paper with a string. Grasshopper became interested what is the minimum jump ability he should have in order to be able to reach the far end of the string, jumping only on vowels of the English alphabet. Jump ability is the maximum possible length of his jump. 

Formally, consider that at the begginning the Grasshopper is located directly in front of the leftmost character of the string. His goal is to reach the position right after the rightmost character of the string. In one jump the Grasshopper could jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. [Image] The picture corresponds to the first example. 

The following letters are vowels: 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U' and 'Y'.


-----Input-----

The first line contains non-empty string consisting of capital English letters. It is guaranteed that the length of the string does not exceed 100. 


-----Output-----

Print single integer a — the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper (in the number of symbols) that is needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.

Program:

    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
    if last_vowel != n - 1:
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    print(max_jump)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string. The issue with the program is in the way it calculates the `max_jump` value.

The program calculates the `max_jump` value as the maximum of the current `max_jump` and the distance between the current vowel and the last vowel (or the start of the string if it's the first vowel) divided by 2 plus 1. However, this calculation is incorrect because it assumes that the Grasshopper can always jump to the next vowel in exactly half the distance between the two vowels, which is not necessarily true.

A counterexample to the program is the input "ABC". In this case, the program calculates `max_jump` as 2, but the correct minimum jump ability is 3, because the Grasshopper needs to jump over the 'B' to reach the end of the string.

Here is the correct way to calculate the minimum jump ability:

- Initialize `max_jump` to 0 and `last_vowel` to -1.
- Iterate over each character in the string.
- If the character is a vowel, update `max_jump` to be the maximum of `max_jump` and the distance between the current vowel and `last_vowel` (or the start of the string if `last_vowel` is -1), and update `last_vowel` to the current index.
- After the loop, update `max_jump` to be the maximum of `max_jump` and the distance between `last_vowel` and the end of the string.
- The correct calculation of `max_jump` should be the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels (or the start/end of the string and the nearest vowel), not divided by 2.

The given program does not take this into account, so it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: the input is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    max_jump = 0
    last_vowel = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            if last_vowel == -1:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, i + 1)
            else:
                max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
            last_vowel = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowel is found, `max_jump` is the maximum jump between any two vowels in `s` plus one, or the position of the first vowel plus one if only one vowel is present, or 0 if no vowels are present.
    if (last_vowel != n - 1) :
        max_jump = max(max_jump, (n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is `n - 1`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if no vowel is found. If the last character of `s` is not a vowel, then `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `(n - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Otherwise, `max_jump` remains unchanged.
    print(max_jump)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
