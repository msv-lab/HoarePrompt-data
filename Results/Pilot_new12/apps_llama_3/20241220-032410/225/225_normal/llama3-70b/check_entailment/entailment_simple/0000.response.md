Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description because it incorrectly calculates the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper. 

In the problem description, it is stated that the Grasshopper can jump to the right any distance from 1 to the value of his jump ability. The minimum jump ability is the smallest value that allows the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels.

The program calculates `max_jump` as the maximum of the current `max_jump` and `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, where `i` is the index of the current vowel and `last_vowel` is the index of the previous vowel. However, this is not correct because `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1` does not represent the minimum jump ability required to jump from the previous vowel to the current vowel.

To calculate the minimum jump ability, we need to find the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string. If we denote the indices of the vowels as `v1`, `v2`,..., `vn`, then the minimum jump ability is the maximum of `v1 + 1`, `v2 - v1`, `v3 - v2`,..., `vn - v(n-1)`, `n - vn`.

Here is an example where the program does not follow the problem description:

Input: AAAB

The program calculates `max_jump` as 1, but the correct minimum jump ability is 2, because the Grasshopper needs to jump 2 steps from the first 'A' to the third 'A' to reach the end of the string.

So, the program does not do what the problem description asks for every potential case, and it is therefore incorrect. 

To correct this program, we should find the indices of all vowels in the string and then calculate the minimum jump ability as the maximum of the distances between any two consecutive vowels, the position of the first vowel, and the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. 

Here is a corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    s = input()
    vowels = 'AEIOUY'
    n = len(s)
    vowel_indices = [i for i in range(n) if s[i] in vowels]
    
    if not vowel_indices:
        print(n)
    else:
        max_jump = max(vowel_indices[0] + 1, n - vowel_indices[-1])
        for i in range(1, len(vowel_indices)):
            max_jump = max(max_jump, vowel_indices[i] - vowel_indices[i - 1])
        print(max_jump)
```
This program first finds the indices of all vowels in the string. If there are no vowels, it prints the length of the string. Otherwise, it calculates the minimum jump ability as the maximum of the position of the first vowel, the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string, and the distances between any two consecutive vowels.
