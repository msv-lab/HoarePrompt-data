The code updates the value of `prev_pos` to be equal to `i`. The value of `i` is 2. 

So, `prev_pos` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length of at least 2, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is either 1 or `i - prev_pos` if `i - prev_pos` > `1`, `i` is 2, `prev_pos` is 2.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length of at least 2, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `i` is 2, `prev_pos` is 2**
