To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider how the loop iterates and what changes from one iteration to the next.

Given the loop statement `for i in range(len(s)):` and the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100.
- `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `max_jump` is 1.
- `i` is 0.

The loop will iterate over the indices of the string `s`. At the end of the first iteration (`i` is 0), for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to increment by 1.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration:
- `s` remains unchanged as it's not modified by the loop statement itself.
- `vowels` remains unchanged as it's not modified by the loop statement.
- `max_jump` remains unchanged as there's no information provided about how it's updated within the loop.
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next character in the string.

So, `i` goes from 0 to 1.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `i` is 1**
