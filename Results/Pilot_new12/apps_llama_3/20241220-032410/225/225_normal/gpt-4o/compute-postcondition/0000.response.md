The given code defines a set `vowels` containing the capital English letters 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'. This set represents the vowels in the English alphabet, including 'Y' as a vowel.

The initial state specifies that `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100. 

Since the code only defines the `vowels` set and does not modify the string `s` or use it in any operations, the state of `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.**
