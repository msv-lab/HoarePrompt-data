The code assigns the value of `i` to `prev_pos`. Given that `i` is 1, `prev_pos` becomes 1. 

The value of `max_jump` is `max(1, 1 - prev_pos)`, which now becomes `max(1, 1 - 1)` since `prev_pos` is 1. This simplifies to `max(1, 0)`, resulting in `max_jump` being 1.

The other variables `s` and `vowels` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `i` is 1, `prev_pos` is 1**
