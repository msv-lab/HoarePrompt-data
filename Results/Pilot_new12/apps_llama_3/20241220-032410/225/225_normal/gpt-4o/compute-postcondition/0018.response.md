To determine the output state, we need to consider the values of `max_jump`, `len(s)`, and `prev_pos`. 

- `s` is a non-empty string with a length not exceeding 100, consisting of capital English letters.
- `vowels` is defined as {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, but its value isn't directly used in the return statement.
- `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `len(s) - prev_pos`.
- `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel in `s` (or -1 if `s` does not contain any vowels).

Given that `return max_jump`, we're looking at the maximum jump value, which depends on the length of `s` and the position of the last vowel (`prev_pos`).

The maximum possible value for `len(s)` is 100, and the minimum is 1 since `s` is non-empty.

If `s` does not contain any vowels, `prev_pos` would be -1, making `len(s) - prev_pos` equal to `len(s) + 1`. This means `max_jump` could potentially be `len(s) + 1`, with a maximum value of 101.

If `s` does contain vowels, `prev_pos` would be the index of the last vowel, which could be anywhere from 0 to `len(s) - 1`. This makes `len(s) - prev_pos` variable, depending on where the last vowel is. The minimum value for `max_jump` in this scenario would be 1 (if the last vowel is the last character in `s`), and the maximum would still depend on the initial value of `max_jump` and the position of the last vowel.

Therefore, without knowing the exact initial value of `max_jump` and the specific string `s`, we can only describe the nature of what is returned:

Output State: **The program returns the maximum jump value, which is the maximum of its previous value and the difference between the length of string `s` and the index of the last vowel in `s` (or `len(s) + 1` if `s` does not contain any vowels), where `s` is a non-empty string of capital English letters not exceeding 100 characters in length.**
