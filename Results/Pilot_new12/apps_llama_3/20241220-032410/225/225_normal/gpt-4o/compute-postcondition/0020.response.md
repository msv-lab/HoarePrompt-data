Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in a given non-empty string `s` of capital English letters, not exceeding 100 characters in length, including the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. It accepts a string `s` as input, where `s` only contains capital English letters and has a length between 1 and 100. The function considers 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y' as vowels. If the string contains less than two vowels, the function returns a minimum value of 1 for the maximum jump. If the string does not contain any vowels, the function returns the length of the string plus 1, effectively measuring the distance from the start of the string to the end, since there are no vowels to calculate distance between. The function does not modify the input string `s`.**
