To determine the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

Given:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length of at least 2.
- `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `max_jump` is 1.
- `i` is 2.

The code to execute is:
```python
max_jump = max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)
```

However, there's a variable `prev_pos` used in the code that is not defined in the initial state. For the purpose of this analysis, let's assume `prev_pos` is some position in the string `s` that has been previously determined, but its exact value is not specified.

The impact of this line is to update `max_jump` with the maximum value between its current value (`1`) and the difference between `i` (`2`) and `prev_pos`.

Without knowing the exact value of `prev_pos`, we can consider a few possibilities:

1. If `prev_pos` is less than `i` (i.e., `prev_pos` < `2`), then `i - prev_pos` will be greater than `0`, potentially changing `max_jump` if `i - prev_pos` > `1`.
2. If `prev_pos` equals `i` (i.e., `prev_pos` = `2`), then `i - prev_pos` equals `0`, and `max_jump` remains unchanged because `max(1, 0)` equals `1`.
3. If `prev_pos` is greater than `i` (i.e., `prev_pos` > `2`), then `i - prev_pos` will be negative, and `max_jump` remains `1` because `max(1, negative_value)` equals `1`.

Given these scenarios and without a specific value for `prev_pos`, we cannot determine a precise new value for `max_jump`. However, we can conclude that `max_jump` will either remain `1` or increase, depending on the value of `prev_pos`.

Thus, the output state is: 
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length of at least 2.
- `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}.
- `max_jump` is either 1 or increased to `i - prev_pos` if `i - prev_pos` > `1`.
- `i` is 2.

Since `i - prev_pos` could be greater than `1` only if `prev_pos` is less than `1`, and given that `i` is `2`, `max_jump` will be updated to `2 - prev_pos` if `prev_pos` is `0` or `1`. For any other value of `prev_pos`, `max_jump` either stays the same or becomes a value greater than `1` if `prev_pos` is negative or less than `1`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length of at least 2, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is either 1 or `i - prev_pos` if `i - prev_pos` > `1`, `i` is 2**
