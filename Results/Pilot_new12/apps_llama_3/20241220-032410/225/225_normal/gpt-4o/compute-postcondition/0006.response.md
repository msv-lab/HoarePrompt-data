`prev_pos` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. The current character at position `i` in string `s` is still a vowel. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is still {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is still 1, `prev_pos` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current character at position `i` in string `s` is a vowel.
