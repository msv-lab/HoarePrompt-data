Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `i` is 0. If the current character at position `i` in string `s` is a vowel, then `prev_pos` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part in the code.***
