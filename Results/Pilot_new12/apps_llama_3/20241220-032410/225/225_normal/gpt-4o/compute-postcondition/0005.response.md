Since `i` is 0 and `prev_pos` is -1, we calculate `i - prev_pos` as 0 - (-1) = 1. The `max_jump` is currently 1. 

The value of `max(max_jump, i - prev_pos)` will be the maximum of 1 and 1, which equals 1. 

So, `max_jump` remains 1.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current character at position `i` in string `s` is a vowel.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, `i` is 0, and the current character at position `i` in string `s` is a vowel**
