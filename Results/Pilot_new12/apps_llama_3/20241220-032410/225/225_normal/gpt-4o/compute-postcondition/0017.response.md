The code updates the value of `max_jump` to be the maximum of its current value and the distance between the end of the string `s` and the last vowel in `s` (given by `prev_pos`). 

Given that `max_jump` is the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in `s` (or 1 if `s` contains less than two vowels), `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel in `s` (or -1 if `s` does not contain any vowels), and `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, the updated `max_jump` will be the maximum of its current value and `len(s) - prev_pos`. 

If `s` does not contain any vowels, `prev_pos` will be -1, so `max_jump` will be updated to `max(max_jump, len(s) + 1)`. However, since the maximum length of `s` is 100, `max_jump` will be at most 101 in this case.

If `s` contains at least one vowel, `prev_pos` will be the index of the last vowel, and `max_jump` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and the distance between the end of `s` and the last vowel.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is the maximum of its previous value and `len(s) - prev_pos`, `prev_pos` is the index of the last vowel in `s` (or -1 if `s` does not contain any vowels)**
