The code introduces a new variable `prev_pos` and assigns it the value -1. The values of the other variables `s`, `vowels`, and `max_jump` are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, and `prev_pos` is -1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, and `prev_pos` is -1**
