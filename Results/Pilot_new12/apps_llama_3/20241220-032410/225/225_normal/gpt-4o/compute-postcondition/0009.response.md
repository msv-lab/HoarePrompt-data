To calculate the impact of the code on the program, let's analyze it step by step. The code updates the value of `max_jump` based on the current value of `max_jump` and the difference between `i` and `prev_pos`. However, we need to note that the value of `prev_pos` is not provided in the initial state. 

Given that `max_jump` is initially 1 and `i` is 1, without knowing `prev_pos`, we can express the new value of `max_jump` as `max(1, 1 - prev_pos)`. Since `prev_pos` is not defined, we cannot directly compute a numerical value for `max_jump` after the execution. However, we can express its new value relative to `prev_pos`.

The states of the other variables (`s`, `vowels`, `i`) are not affected by the given line of code. Thus, `s` remains a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` remains {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, and `i` remains 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is `max(1, 1 - prev_pos)`, `i` is 1**
