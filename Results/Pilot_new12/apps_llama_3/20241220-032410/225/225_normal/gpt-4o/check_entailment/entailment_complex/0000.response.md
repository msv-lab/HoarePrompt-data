Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and meets all the requirements.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Validation**: The program assumes that the input will be a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, which is guaranteed by the problem description.
2. **Vowel Identification**: The program correctly identifies the vowels as 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', and 'Y', which is in line with the problem description.
3. **Maximum Jump Calculation**: The program calculates the maximum jump ability by finding the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels in the string, including the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string. This is exactly what the problem description requires.
4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases correctly, such as:
	* If the string contains less than two vowels, the program returns a minimum value of 1 for the maximum jump, which is in line with the problem description.
	* If the string does not contain any vowels, the program returns the length of the string plus 1, effectively measuring the distance from the start of the string to the end, since there are no vowels to calculate distance between.
5. **Output**: The program returns a single integer, which is the minimum jump ability of the Grasshopper needed to overcome the given string, jumping only on vowels.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
