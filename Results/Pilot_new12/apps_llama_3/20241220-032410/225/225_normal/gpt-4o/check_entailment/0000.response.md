Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program correctly determines the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to jump over the string, only landing on vowels. Here's why:

- The function initializes `max_jump` to 1 and `prev_pos` to -1, correctly setting the initial minimum jump requirement and the position of the previous vowel.
- It iterates over the string `s`, checking if each character is a vowel. If it is, the function updates `max_jump` with the maximum of the current `max_jump` and the distance from the previous vowel (`i - prev_pos`), effectively calculating the longest jump needed so far. It then updates `prev_pos` to the current position `i`.
- After iterating through all characters, the function performs one more update to `max_jump` to account for the jump needed to reach beyond the end of the string (`len(s) - prev_pos`). This ensures that the final `max_jump` value includes the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
- The program correctly handles edge cases, such as strings with no vowels or strings consisting entirely of vowels, as demonstrated by the examples.

The code accurately implements the logic required by the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
