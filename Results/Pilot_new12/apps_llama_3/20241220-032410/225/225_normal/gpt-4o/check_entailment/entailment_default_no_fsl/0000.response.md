Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum jump ability required for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the maximum distance between any two consecutive vowels, including the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.

Here's a breakdown of the code's correctness:

1. **Vowel set definition**: The code correctly defines the set of vowels as `{'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}`.
2. **Initialization**: The code initializes `max_jump` to 1 and `prev_pos` to -1, which is correct.
3. **Iteration**: The code iterates through the string and updates `max_jump` and `prev_pos` accordingly. If a vowel is found, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the distance between the current position and `prev_pos`. `prev_pos` is then updated to the current position.
4. **Final update**: After the loop, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string.
5. **Return**: The function returns `max_jump`, which represents the minimum jump ability required.

The code handles all possible cases, including:

* Strings with multiple vowels
* Strings with a single vowel
* Strings with no vowels (in which case the function returns the length of the string plus 1)
* Strings with vowels at the beginning and/or end

The provided examples in the problem description also match the expected output of the code.

Overall, the code is correct and meets the problem requirements.
