Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases because it simply checks if any of the elements in a 2x2 submatrix is 1 and then applies the operation. However, this approach can lead to unnecessary operations or miss required operations.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:
4 4
1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0

In this case, the program will apply operations unnecessarily for the submatrices where only two elements are 1, which is not required. 

Also, it does not check if the operation is actually making the matrix B equal to matrix A. It just checks if there are any 1s in the submatrix and applies the operation. This can lead to a situation where the program applies more operations than required or applies operations that are not necessary.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
