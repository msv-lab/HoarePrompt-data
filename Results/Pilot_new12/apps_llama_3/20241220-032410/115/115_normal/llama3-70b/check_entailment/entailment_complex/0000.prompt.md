You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

Input
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

Output
-1

Input
3 2
0 0
0 0
0 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but the input is given through a series of read operations where the first line contains two integers n and m (2 <= n, m <= 50), and then n lines follow, each containing m integers. The j-th integer in the i-th line is either 0 or 1.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1
                ] == 1:
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` representing the positions where any of the values `A[row - 1][column - 1]`, `A[row - 1][column]`, `A[row][column - 1]`, or `A[row][column]` is 1, unless all four values are 1, for `row` in the range `1` to `n` and `column` in the range `1` to `m`. If `n` is less than 2 or `m` is less than 2, `ops` is an empty list.
    if (len(ops) > 2500) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length less than or equal to 2500, and all operations in `ops` have been printed.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, if the length of `ops` is more than 2500, the value -1 has been printed, otherwise, all operations in `ops` have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads input through a series of operations, starting with two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of `m` integers (0 or 1), and then identifies positions where at least one of the four adjacent values (up, down, left, right) is 1, unless all four values are 1. It prints the count of such positions if it's less than or equal to 2500, along with the positions themselves. If the count exceeds 2500, it prints -1. The function does not return any value, it only prints the results. The input values `n` and `m` must be between 2 and 50. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` is outside this range, or where the input values are not 0 or 1, as this is not specified in the provided code. It only checks for the specified condition within the given input range. The function's output is printed to the console, and its state after execution includes the printed output and the input values `n`, `m`, and the list `A`, but these are not returned or further processed.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
