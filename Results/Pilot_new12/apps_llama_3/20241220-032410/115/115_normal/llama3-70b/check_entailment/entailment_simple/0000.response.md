Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly follow the problem description. The main issue lies in the logic of determining the operations needed to make matrix B equal to matrix A.

In the problem description, it's stated that during each operation, a submatrix of size 2x2 in matrix B is chosen and all its elements are set to 1. The goal is to make matrix B equal to matrix A.

The program attempts to achieve this by iterating over each 2x2 submatrix in matrix A. If any of the elements in the submatrix are 1 (except for the case where all elements are 1), it adds an operation to set the corresponding submatrix in B to 1.

However, this approach is flawed. It doesn't consider the actual state of matrix B after each operation. Setting a submatrix to 1 in matrix B should affect the subsequent operations, but the program doesn't account for this.

For example, if a submatrix in A has the values [[1, 0], [0, 1]], the program will add an operation to set the corresponding submatrix in B to 1. But after this operation, the submatrix in B will become [[1, 1], [1, 1]], which is not equal to the original submatrix in A.

Additionally, the program does not check if the added operations are sufficient to make matrix B equal to matrix A. It only checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500, which is not the correct condition to determine if the operations are valid.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should simulate the operations on matrix B and check if the final state of matrix B is equal to matrix A. It should also ensure that the operations are valid and sufficient to achieve the goal. The provided program does not meet these requirements, so it is incorrect.
