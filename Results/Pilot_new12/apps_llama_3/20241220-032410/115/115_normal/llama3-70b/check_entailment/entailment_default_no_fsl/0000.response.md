Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks for positions where at least one of the four adjacent values is 1, unless all four values are 1. However, this does not guarantee that the resulting matrix B will be equal to matrix A.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
The program will output:
```
8
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
1 1
1 2
2 1
2 2
```
However, this sequence of operations will not result in matrix B being equal to matrix A, because the operations are applied incorrectly. The correct output for this input should be -1, as it is impossible to make matrix B equal to matrix A.

The problem description requires the program to find a sequence of operations that makes matrix B equal to matrix A, if such a sequence exists. The program should not just identify positions where operations can be applied, but also ensure that the resulting matrix B is equal to matrix A. The current implementation does not meet this requirement, and therefore the program is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the program would need to be modified to correctly apply the operations and verify that the resulting matrix B is equal to matrix A. This could involve simulating the application of the operations and checking the resulting matrix, or using a more sophisticated algorithm to find the correct sequence of operations.
