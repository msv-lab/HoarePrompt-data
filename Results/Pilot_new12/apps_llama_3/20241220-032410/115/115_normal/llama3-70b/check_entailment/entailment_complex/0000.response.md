Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. The problem statement requires that the program make matrix B equal to matrix A by performing operations on 2x2 submatrices of B. However, the provided program only checks for the existence of 1s in the 2x2 submatrices of A and prints the positions where these 1s are found, unless all four values are 1.

The program does not actually perform any operations on matrix B to make it equal to matrix A. It does not handle cases where a 2x2 submatrix of A has three 1s and one 0, or two 1s and two 0s, which would require specific operations to be performed on the corresponding submatrix of B.

Additionally, the program does not verify whether the given sequence of operations actually makes matrix B equal to matrix A. It simply prints the positions where 1s are found in the 2x2 submatrices of A, which does not guarantee that the operations will make B equal to A.

To correctly follow the problem description, the program should perform operations on matrix B based on the values in matrix A, and verify whether the resulting matrix B is equal to matrix A. The provided program does not do this, and therefore is incorrect.
