You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly in all cases. Specifically, it fails when there are isolated 1s in the matrix A that cannot be set to 1 by any 2x2 submatrix operation.

For example, consider the input:

```
3 3
1 0 0
0 0 0
0 0 1
```

In this case, the program will attempt to set the top-left and bottom-right 1s in matrix A, but it will not be able to do so because there is no 2x2 submatrix that contains only these two 1s. As a result, the program will output an incorrect sequence of operations.

The issue with the program is that it only checks if any of the four elements in the 2x2 submatrix is 1, and if so, it adds the submatrix to the list of operations. However, this approach does not ensure that the resulting sequence of operations will correctly set all the 1s in matrix A.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle isolated 1s in matrix A. One possible approach is to check if a 2x2 submatrix contains only one 1, and if so, skip that submatrix. However, this approach requires additional logic to handle cases where isolated 1s can be set by a 2x2 submatrix operation.

Another approach is to use a more sophisticated algorithm that takes into account the connectivity of the 1s in matrix A. For example, the program could use a flood fill algorithm to identify connected components of 1s in matrix A, and then generate a sequence of operations that sets each connected component to 1.

In summary, the program is incorrect because it does not handle isolated 1s in matrix A correctly. To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to use a more sophisticated algorithm that takes into account the connectivity of the 1s in matrix A.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function reads input through a series of operations, starting with two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of `m` integers (0 or 1), and then identifies positions where at least one of the four adjacent values (up, down, left, right) is 1, unless all four values are 1. It prints the count of such positions if it's less than or equal to 2500, along with the positions themselves. If the count exceeds 2500, it prints -1. The function does not return any value, it only prints the results. The input values `n` and `m` must be between 2 and 50. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` is outside this range, or where the input values are not 0 or 1, as this is not specified in the provided code. It only checks for the specified condition within the given input range. The function's output is printed to the console, and its state after execution includes the printed output and the input values `n`, `m`, and the list `A`, but these are not returned or further processed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
