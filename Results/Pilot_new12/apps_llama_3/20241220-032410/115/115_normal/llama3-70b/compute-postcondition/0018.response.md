Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 and `m` is greater than 3, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and if `A[i][j]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop; otherwise, the execution proceeds with the current state of variables.**
