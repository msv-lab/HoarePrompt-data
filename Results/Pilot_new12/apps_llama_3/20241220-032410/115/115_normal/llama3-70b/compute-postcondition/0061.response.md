Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` representing the positions where any of the values `A[row - 1][column - 1]`, `A[row - 1][column]`, `A[row][column - 1]`, or `A[row][column]` is 1, unless all four values are 1, for `row` in the range `1` to `n` and `column` in the range `1` to `m`. The current value of `ops` has more than 2500 elements.**
