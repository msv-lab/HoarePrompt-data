The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since the current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, the tuple `(1, j)` should not be included in the `ops` list according to the given condition. No changes are made to the variables as a result of the `continue` statement. The loop will move on to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m - 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` is a list of tuples `(1, k)` for all `k` where any of the values `A[0][k]`, `A[1][k]`, `A[0][k + 1]`, or `A[1][k + 1]` is 1 for the corresponding `k`, unless all four values are 1, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
