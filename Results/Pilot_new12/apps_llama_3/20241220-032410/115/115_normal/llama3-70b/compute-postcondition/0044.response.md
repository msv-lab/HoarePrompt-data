The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are not provided with the loop that this `continue` statement is a part of, we can infer that the loop will move on to the next iteration. However, no explicit changes are made to the variables `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, or `ops` by the `continue` statement itself.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50.
- `m` is an integer and must be at least 2.
- `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 0.
- `ops` is a list of tuples including the original operations and the updated operations.
- The current values of the variables in `A` are such that `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1.

And considering the `continue` statement does not directly modify any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the understanding that the loop this statement is part of will proceed to its next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer and must be at least 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` is a list of tuples including the original operations and the updated operations, `A[2][0]` equals 1, `A[3][0]` equals 1, `A[2][1]` equals 1, `A[3][1]` equals 1, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
