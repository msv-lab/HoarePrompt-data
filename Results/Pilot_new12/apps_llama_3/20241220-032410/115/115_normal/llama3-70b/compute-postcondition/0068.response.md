Since `op` is not defined, I will assume that it is actually `ops[1]` based on the given initial state that the next operation to be processed is `ops[1]`. 

The given code prints the first and second elements of `ops[1]`. The value of `ops[1]` is a tuple `(row, column)`, where `row` and `column` are integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2499, the next operation to be processed is `ops[1]`, and `ops[1][0]` and `ops[1][1]` have been printed.**
