The given code is `n, m = map(int, input().split())`. This line reads two integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`, respectively.

Given the initial state that the input is provided through a series of read operations where the first line contains two integers `n` and `m` (2 <= `n`, `m` <= 50), we can infer the following:

- `n` and `m` are integers.
- The range of `n` and `m` is between 2 and 50, inclusive.

After executing the code, `n` and `m` are assigned the values read from the input, but the specific values are not provided. However, we know they fall within the specified range due to the problem constraints.

The output state, considering the initial state and the execution of the code, is that `n` and `m` are assigned integer values within the range of 2 to 50.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50**
