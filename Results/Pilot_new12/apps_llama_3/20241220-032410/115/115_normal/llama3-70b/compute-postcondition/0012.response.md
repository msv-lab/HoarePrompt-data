The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there's no loop shown in the given code snippet, we'll assume it's part of a loop. The `continue` statement does not change the values of the variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 and `m` is greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 1 and we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
