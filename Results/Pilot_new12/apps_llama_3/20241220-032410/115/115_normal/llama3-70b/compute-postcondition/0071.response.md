To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the initial state of the variables.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`
- `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length less than or equal to 2500

The loop code is:
```python
for op in ops:
    print(op[0], op[1])
```
This loop iterates over each tuple in the `ops` list and prints the row and column values.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be:
- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (unchanged)
- `m` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (unchanged)
- `A` remains a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m` (unchanged)
- `ops` remains a list of tuples `(row, column)` but all its elements have been processed and printed

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `ops` is an empty list), the output state will be the same as the initial state, since no changes are made to any variables.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length less than or equal to 2500, and all operations in `ops` have been printed.**
