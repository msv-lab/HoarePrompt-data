The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not affect the values of the variables. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 and `m` is greater than 3, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
