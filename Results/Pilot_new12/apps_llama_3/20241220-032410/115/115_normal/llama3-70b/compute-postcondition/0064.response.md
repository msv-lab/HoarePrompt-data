The code prints the length of the `ops` list. The length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500. After printing, the state of the variables does not change. 
The value of `n` is still an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`. The length of `ops` is still less than or equal to 2500.
The number of operations `ops` has been returned as the output.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, the length of `ops` has been returned as output, and `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length less than or equal to 2500.**
