The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The initial state specifies that `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 and `m` is greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers. Additionally, the initial state specifies that if `A[i][j]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop with `i` as 0 and `j` as 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged with `i` as 0 and `j` as 1.

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, the code appends the tuple `(0 + 1, 1 + 1)` to `ops`, which simplifies to `(1, 2)`. 

The values of `n`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged. 

The list `ops` now contains the tuple `(1, 2)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 and `m` is greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ops` contains the tuple `(1, 2)`**
