According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `m` is greater than 1. So, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. Thus, `j` is 1.

Also, since the list `A` has `n` sublists of length at least `m - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, the sublists must have at least `m` elements to allow `j` to be 1 and still be a valid index.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `ops` is a list of tuples including `(1, k)` for all `k` where any of the values `A[0][k]`, `A[1][k]`, `A[0][k + 1]`, or `A[1][k + 1]` is 1 for the corresponding `k`, unless all four values are 1, and also `(2, 1)` if `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1**
