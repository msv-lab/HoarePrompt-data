Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 and `m` is greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers. If `A[i][j]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then we skip to the next iteration of the most internal loop with `i` as 0 and `j` as 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged with `i` as 0 and `j` as 1.**
