The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since the initial state is given with specific values for `n`, `m`, `A`, `ops`, `i`, and `j`, and the `continue` statement does not explicitly modify any variables, the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `ops`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

However, the effect of the `continue` statement is to move on to the next iteration of the loop, but since the initial state does not specify any loop construct, we will focus on the variable states as provided. The state of the list `A` and its elements at specific indices `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are also unchanged because `continue` does not modify variable values directly; it influences the flow of the program.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and `m` is greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers, `ops` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, the current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
