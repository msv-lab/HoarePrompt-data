Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer and must be at least 3, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `ops` is a list of tuples including the original operations and the updated operations, if `A[2][0]` equals 1 or `A[3][0]` equals 1 or `A[2][1]` equals 1 or `A[3][1]` equals 1, then `ops` includes the tuple `(3, 1)`, if `A[i][j]` equals 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `ops` also includes the tuple `(3, 2)`, and if `A[2][1]` equals 1 and `A[3][1]` equals 1 and `A[2][2]` equals 1 and `A[3][2]` equals 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the execution continues with the current state of variables.***
