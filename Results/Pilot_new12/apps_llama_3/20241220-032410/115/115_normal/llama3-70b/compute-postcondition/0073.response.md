The function `func` accepts no parameters directly, but it takes input through a series of read operations. The input consists of two integers `n` and `m` (2 <= n, m <= 50) on the first line, followed by `n` lines, each containing `m` integers. Each of these integers is either 0 or 1. 

However, since the specific output or return values of the function are not described in the problem, we cannot determine the exact return values based on the input provided. Normally, we would describe the functionality based on how the input influences the output, such as specific return values or messages based on conditions. 

Given the information provided, we can only describe the input structure. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept input in a specific format: two integers `n` and `m` on the first line, followed by `n` lines of `m` integers (0 or 1 each), but without specific output details, the return behavior remains undefined.

Functionality: **The function accepts input through a series of read operations, starting with two integers n and m, followed by n lines of m integers (0 or 1), but the return behavior is undefined based on the provided information.**
