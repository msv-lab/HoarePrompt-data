The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a new tuple to the end of the list `ops`. This tuple contains the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`, which are currently 1 and 1, respectively, since `i` is 0 and `j` is 0.

So, the list `ops` now contains the tuple `(1, 1)` as its last element. The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and `m` is greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers, `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1**
