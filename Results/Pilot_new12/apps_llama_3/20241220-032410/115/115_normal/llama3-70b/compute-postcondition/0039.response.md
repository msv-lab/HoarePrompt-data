Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `ops` is a list of tuples including the updated operations based on the new state of `A`, `i`, and `j`. If `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `ops` includes the tuple `(2, 3)`. Otherwise, the state of `A`, `i`, `j`, and `ops` remains unchanged.**
