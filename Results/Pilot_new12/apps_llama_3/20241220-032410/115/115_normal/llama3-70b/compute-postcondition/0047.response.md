To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is as follows:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50.
- `m` is an integer and must be at least 2.
- `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 0.
- `ops` is a list of tuples including the original operations and the updated operations.

Given that we are executing the line `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))`, we need to consider the values of `i` and `j` and how they affect `ops`.

Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, `i + 1` equals 3 and `j + 1` equals 1. Therefore, the tuple `(3, 1)` is appended to `ops`.

The output state, considering the update to `ops` and the fact that the other conditions and variables remain unchanged, is as follows:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50.
- `m` is an integer and must be at least 2.
- `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 0.
- `ops` is a list of tuples including the original operations and the updated operations, and it now includes the tuple `(3, 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer and must be at least 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `ops` is a list of tuples including the original operations and the updated operations and now includes the tuple `(3, 1)`.**
