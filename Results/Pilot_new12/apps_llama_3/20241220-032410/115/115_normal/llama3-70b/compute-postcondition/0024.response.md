Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m - 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` is a list of tuples `(1, k)` for all `k` where any of the values `A[0][j]`, `A[1][j]`, `A[0][j + 1]`, or `A[1][j + 1]` is 1 for the corresponding `j`, unless all four values are 1. The current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1.**
