To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the provided code and its impact on the variables.

The given code is:
```
A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
```
This code creates a 2D list `A` where each sublist is a list of integers. The number of sublists is determined by the value of `n`. Each sublist is generated by taking an input, splitting it into strings (using whitespace as the delimiter), converting these strings into integers, and then using these integers as the elements of the sublist.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50.
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50.

The code does not directly modify the values of `n` and `m`. However, it introduces a new variable `A`, which is a list of `n` sublists, each containing integer values obtained from user input. The exact values in `A` depend on the input provided by the user during the execution of the code.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 50.
- `m` remains an integer between 2 and 50.
- `A` is a list of `n` sublists, where each sublist contains integers input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers**
