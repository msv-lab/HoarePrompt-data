The code snippet `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` updates the `ops` list by appending a tuple containing the incremented values of `i` and `j`. 

The initial state is: `n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `ops` is a list of tuples including the updated operations based on the new state of `A`, `i`, and `j`.

The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, and `j` are not changed by the code. The `ops` list is updated by appending the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, which is equivalent to `(2, 3)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `ops` is a list of tuples including the updated operations based on the new state of `A`, `i`, and `j`, and `ops` includes the tuple `(2, 3)`.**
