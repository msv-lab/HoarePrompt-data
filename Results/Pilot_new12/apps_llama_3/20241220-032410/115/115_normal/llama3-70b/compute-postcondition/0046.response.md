Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer and must be at least 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `ops` is a list of tuples including the original operations and the updated operations. The current value of `i` is 2 and `j` is 0. If `A[2][0]` equals 1, `A[3][0]` equals 1, `A[2][1]` equals 1, and `A[3][1]` equals 1, then we had moved to the next iteration of the loop, but now, after entering the if condition, it is known that at least one of the following conditions is met: `A[2][0]` equals 1, `A[3][0]` equals 1, `A[2][1]` equals 1, or `A[3][1]` equals 1.**
