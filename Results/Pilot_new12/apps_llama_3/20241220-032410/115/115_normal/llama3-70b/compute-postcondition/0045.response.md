Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer and must be at least 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `ops` is a list of tuples including the original operations and the updated operations. If `A[2][0]` equals 1, `A[3][0]` equals 1, `A[2][1]` equals 1, and `A[3][1]` equals 1, then we move to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, the execution continues without any changes to the variables.***
