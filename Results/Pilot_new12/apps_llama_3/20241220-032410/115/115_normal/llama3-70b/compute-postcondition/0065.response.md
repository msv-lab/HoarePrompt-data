To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement: `for op in ops`. This loop will iterate over each element `op` in the list `ops`.

Given state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50.
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50.
- `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`.
- The length of `ops` has been returned as output.
- `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length less than or equal to 2500.

For the loop `for op in ops` to execute, the critical factor is the list `ops`. The loop will execute if `ops` is not empty, meaning it must have at least one tuple `(row, column)`.

Adjusting the state:
- Since `n`, `m`, and `A` do not directly influence the execution of the loop over `ops`, their conditions remain as they are.
- The key condition for `ops` is that it must not be empty for the loop to execute. Thus, `ops` must have at least one tuple.
- The index or any specific `op` (as `row`, `column`) is not explicitly defined before the loop starts, but since `ops` contains tuples of `(row, column)`, each `op` in the loop will be one of these tuples.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2500**
