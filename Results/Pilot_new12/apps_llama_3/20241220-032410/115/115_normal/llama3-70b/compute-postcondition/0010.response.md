Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and `m` is greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers. If at least one of the current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, and `i` is 0, `j` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables does not change.***
