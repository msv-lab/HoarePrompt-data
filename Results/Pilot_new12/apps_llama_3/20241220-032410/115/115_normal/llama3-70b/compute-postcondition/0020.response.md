Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 and `m` is greater than 3, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]` equals 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `ops` is a list that includes the tuple `(1, 3)`.**
