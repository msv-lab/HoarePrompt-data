Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m - 1`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `ops` is a list of tuples `(1, k)` for all `k` where any of the values `A[0][k]`, `A[1][k]`, `A[0][k + 1]`, or `A[1][k + 1]` is 1 for the corresponding `k`, unless all four values are 1. The current value of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is such that at least one of them is 1, meaning that at least one of the following conditions is true: `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1.**
