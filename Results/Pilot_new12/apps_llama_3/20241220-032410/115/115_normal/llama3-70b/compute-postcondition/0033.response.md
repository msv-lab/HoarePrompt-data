The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The value of `i` is 1 and the value of `j` is 1. So, `(i + 1, j + 1)` is equal to `(2, 2)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `ops` is a list of tuples including `(1, k)` for all `k` where any of the values `A[0][k]`, `A[1][k]`, `A[0][k + 1]`, or `A[1][k + 1]` is 1 for the corresponding `k`, unless all four values are 1, and also `(2, 1)` if `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; if `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then we skip to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the execution continues with the current state of the variables, and `(2, 2)`**
