Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and `m` is greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers, `ops` is a list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The current value of at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1**
