Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `ops` is a list of tuples including `(1, k)` for all `k` where any of the values `A[0][k]`, `A[1][k]`, `A[0][k + 1]`, or `A[1][k + 1]` is 1 for the corresponding `k`, unless all four values are 1, and also `(2, 1)` if `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; if `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `(2, 2)` is added to `ops` unless `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, in which case the loop skips to the next iteration, otherwise the execution continues with the current state of the variables.**
