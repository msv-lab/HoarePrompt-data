Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer and must be at least 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `ops` is a list of tuples including the original operations and the updated operations. The current values of the variables in `A` are such that `A[i][j]` equals 1, `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1, `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, indicating that the elements at the specified positions in the sublists of `A` all have the value 1.**
