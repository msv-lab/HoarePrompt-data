Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 and `m` is greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers, `ops` is a list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, if the current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, then we move to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the state of the variables does not change as there is no else part**
