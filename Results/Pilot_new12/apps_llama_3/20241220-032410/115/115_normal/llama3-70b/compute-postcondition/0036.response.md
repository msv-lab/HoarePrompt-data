The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there's no explicit loop provided in the initial code snippet, we'll assume it's part of a larger loop structure that iterates over some elements or indices related to `A`, `i`, `j`, and possibly `ops`.

Given this context, the `continue` statement doesn't directly modify any variables (`n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, `ops`). However, it implies that the execution moves on to the next iteration of the loop, potentially skipping operations that would have otherwise updated these variables or the list `ops`.

Since `i` is 1 and `j` is 2 initially, and there's no explicit increment or modification of these variables within the given code snippet (`continue`), we must infer that any changes to `i`, `j`, or the state of `A` and `ops` would depend on the surrounding loop structure, which isn't provided.

Therefore, considering only the given snippet and initial state, the variables retain their initial values, and the loop (if present) moves to its next iteration without executing any further code within the current iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ops` is a list of tuples including the updated operations based on the new state of `A`, `i`, and `j`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
