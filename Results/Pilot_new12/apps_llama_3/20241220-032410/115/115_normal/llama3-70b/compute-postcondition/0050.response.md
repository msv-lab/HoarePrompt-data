The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there are no loops provided in the given code snippet, the effect of `continue` cannot be directly determined. However, assuming it is part of a loop, the `continue` statement does not change the values of any variables. 

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state: `n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer and must be at least 3, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, and `ops` is a list of tuples including the original operations and the updated operations. If `A[2][0]` equals 1 or `A[3][0]` equals 1 or `A[2][1]` equals 1 or `A[3][1]` equals 1, then `ops` includes the tuple `(3, 1)`. We continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
