Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer and must be at least 4, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `ops` is a list of tuples including the original operations, the updated operations, and if `A[i][j]` equals 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `ops` includes the new tuple `(3, 3)`, in addition to any previously included tuples `(3, 1)` or `(3, 2)` based on the conditions of `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, `A[3][1]`, `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]`, and if `A[i][j]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the execution continues with the current state of variables.**
