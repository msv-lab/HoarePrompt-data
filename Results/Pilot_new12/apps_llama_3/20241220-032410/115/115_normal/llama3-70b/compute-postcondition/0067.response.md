To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. The loop iterates over each operation `op` in the list `ops`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, the first operation `ops[0]` has been processed (printed in this case).
3. For the loop to execute again, there must be more operations left in the `ops` list.

Given this information, the state adjustments for the next iteration are as follows:

- The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 50.
- The value of `m` remains an integer between 2 and 50.
- The value of `A` remains a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`.
- The value of `ops` is now a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2499, since one operation has been processed.
- The next operation to be processed is `ops[1]`, assuming it exists.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2499, and the next operation to be processed is `ops[1]`.**
