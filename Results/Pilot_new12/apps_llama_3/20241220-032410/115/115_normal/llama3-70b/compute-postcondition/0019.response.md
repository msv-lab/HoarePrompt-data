The code `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. 

Since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, the tuple `(0 + 1, 2 + 1)` which is `(1, 3)` is appended to the list `ops`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The initial condition regarding `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` has already been evaluated, and since we are executing the given code, it means the condition for continuing to the next iteration was not met. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 and `m` is greater than 3, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ops` is a list that now includes the tuple `(1, 3)`, and the execution did not continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop because the condition `A[i][j]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1 was not met.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 4 and 50 and `m` is greater than 3, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ops` is a list that includes the tuple `(1, 3)`.**
