To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. 

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`
- `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2500

The given Python code snippet is:
```python
print(op[0], op[1])
```
However, there seems to be a typo in the given code snippet. It should probably be `ops` instead of `op` since `ops` is defined in the initial state. Assuming the correct code is:
```python
print(ops[0][0], ops[0][1])
```
This code prints the first element of the first tuple in the `ops` list, which corresponds to a row, and the second element of the first tuple, which corresponds to a column.

Given this correction, the output state is calculated as follows:
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 50.
- The value of `m` remains an integer between 2 and 50.
- The value of `A` remains a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`.
- The value of `ops` remains a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2500.
- The first tuple in `ops`, `ops[0]`, is printed, with its elements being the row and column of an operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2500, and the first operation `ops[0]` has been printed with values `ops[0][0]` and `ops[0][1]`.**
