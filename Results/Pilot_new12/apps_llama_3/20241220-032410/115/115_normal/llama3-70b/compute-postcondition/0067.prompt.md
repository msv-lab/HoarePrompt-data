You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. 

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50
- `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`
- `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2500

The given Python code snippet is:
```python
print(op[0], op[1])
```
However, there seems to be a typo in the given code snippet. It should probably be `ops` instead of `op` since `ops` is defined in the initial state. Assuming the correct code is:
```python
print(ops[0][0], ops[0][1])
```
This code prints the first element of the first tuple in the `ops` list, which corresponds to a row, and the second element of the first tuple, which corresponds to a column.

Given this correction, the output state is calculated as follows:
- The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 50.
- The value of `m` remains an integer between 2 and 50.
- The value of `A` remains a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`.
- The value of `ops` remains a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2500.
- The first tuple in `ops`, `ops[0]`, is printed, with its elements being the row and column of an operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`n` is an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `ops` is a list of tuples `(row, column)` with length greater than 0 and less than or equal to 2500, and the first operation `ops[0]` has been printed with values `ops[0][0]` and `ops[0][1]`.**
```
for op in ops:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
