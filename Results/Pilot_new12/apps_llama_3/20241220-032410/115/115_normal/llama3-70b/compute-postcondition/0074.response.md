Functionality: **The function reads input through a series of operations, starting with two integers `n` and `m`, followed by `n` lines of `m` integers (0 or 1), and then identifies positions where at least one of the four adjacent values (up, down, left, right) is 1, unless all four values are 1. It prints the count of such positions if it's less than or equal to 2500, along with the positions themselves. If the count exceeds 2500, it prints -1. The function does not return any value, it only prints the results. The input values `n` and `m` must be between 2 and 50. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `m` is outside this range, or where the input values are not 0 or 1, as this is not specified in the provided code. It only checks for the specified condition within the given input range. The function's output is printed to the console, and its state after execution includes the printed output and the input values `n`, `m`, and the list `A`, but these are not returned or further processed.**
