The `continue` statement skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration in the loop. Since we are not provided with the specific loop that the `continue` statement is a part of, we can only conclude that the current iteration is skipped, but the values of the variables do not change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50, `m` is an integer greater than 2, `A` is a list of `n` sublists of input integers with length at least `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ops` is a list of tuples including `(1, k)` for all `k` where any of the values `A[0][k]`, `A[1][k]`, `A[0][k + 1]`, or `A[1][k + 1]` is 1 for the corresponding `k`, unless all four values are 1, and also `(2, 1)` if `A[i][j]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 or `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop**
