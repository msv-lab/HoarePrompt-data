Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **False** is accurate.

The original assessment correctly points out that the program only checks for submatrices of size 2x2 where all elements are 1 in matrix A and applies the operation to those submatrices. However, this approach does not cover all possible cases, as demonstrated by the example input provided in the original assessment.

The annotated version of the code confirms this analysis. The code only checks for 2x2 submatrices where all elements are 1 and applies the operation to those submatrices. The state of the program after the for loop has been executed indicates that `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 if the corresponding elements in `A` are all 1, and `operations` is a list of operations containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each set of elements in `A` that met the condition.

This approach is insufficient to make matrix B equal to matrix A in all cases, as it does not consider submatrices where only some elements are 1. The program will return -1 in such cases, indicating that it is impossible to make matrix B equal to matrix A, even if it is possible to do so by applying the operation to different submatrices.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **False** is accurate, and the program does not correctly solve the problem.

Final: **False**
