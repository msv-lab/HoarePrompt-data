Correctness: **False**

The provided code only checks for 2x2 sub-matrices in A where all elements are 1. If it finds such a sub-matrix, it sets the corresponding elements in B to 1 and records the operation. However, this approach does not cover all possible cases.

For example, consider a 3x3 matrix A where only the middle element is 1, and all other elements are 0. In this case, the code will not find any 2x2 sub-matrices with all elements 1, and it will return -1 because A is not equal to B. However, according to the problem description, it is possible to make B equal to A by performing operations on 2x2 sub-matrices.

Another issue with the code is that it only checks for 2x2 sub-matrices where the top-left element is within the bounds of the matrix A (i.e., i < n-1 and j < m-1). However, the problem description allows for 2x2 sub-matrices where the top-left element is at the edges of the matrix (i.e., i = 0 or j = 0), as long as the sub-matrix is fully contained within the bounds of the matrix.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified to handle cases where the 2x2 sub-matrix is not fully filled with 1s, and to consider all possible 2x2 sub-matrices within the bounds of the matrix A. 

In addition, the code should also consider cases where the matrix A has a size of 2x2 or larger, and where the elements of A are either 0 or 1, and the code should be able to find a sequence of operations that makes B equal to A. 

In the current implementation, if the code does not find any 2x2 sub-matrices with all elements 1, it returns -1. However, the code should continue to check for other possible operations that can make B equal to A. 

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
