Correctness: **False**.

The code only checks for 2x2 sub-matrices in matrix A where all elements are 1 and performs operations based on that. However, it does not handle cases where a single element or a 1x2 or 2x1 sub-matrix in A is 1, which cannot be set to 1 in matrix B by the given operation.

For example, consider a 3x3 matrix A where A[0][0] = 1 and all other elements are 0. In this case, there is no 2x2 sub-matrix with all 1s, so the code will not perform any operations. However, since A[0][0] = 1, matrix B will not be equal to matrix A, so the code will return -1. But the problem description does not guarantee that matrix A will only have 2x2 sub-matrices of 1s, it can have any configuration of 1s and 0s.

Another example is when matrix A has a configuration where two adjacent elements are 1, but the elements below or to the right of them are 0. In this case, the code will not perform any operation to set these 1s in matrix B, even though it is possible to make matrix B equal to matrix A by first setting the elements below or to the right of these 1s to 1 in a different operation.

The code does not consider all possible cases, and the provided output hints agree with this analysis. The code returns -1 when matrix A and matrix B are not equal after processing all operations, but it does not guarantee that matrix B will be equal to matrix A in all cases, which is the requirement of the problem description.
