Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The issue with the program is that it only checks for 2x2 submatrices in `A` where all elements are 1, and then applies the operation to the corresponding submatrix in `B`. However, this approach does not cover all possible cases where `B` can be made equal to `A`.

For example, consider the case where `A` is a 2x2 matrix with elements `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]`. In this case, the program will not find any 2x2 submatrices with all elements 1, and therefore will not apply any operations to `B`. However, it is still possible to make `B` equal to `A` by applying the operation to the 2x2 submatrix twice, first to set the top-left and bottom-right elements to 1, and then to set the top-right and bottom-left elements to 1.

This case is not handled by the program, and therefore the program does not always do what the problem description says. 

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle cases where `A` contains single 1s that are not part of a 2x2 submatrix with all elements 1. One possible approach is to check for such single 1s after the initial loop, and then apply additional operations to `B` to set the corresponding elements to 1. However, the exact implementation details will depend on the specific requirements of the problem. 

In addition, the program also does not handle the case where `A` is a 2x2 matrix with elements `[[0, 1], [1, 0]]` or `[[1, 0], [0, 1]]` correctly. In this case, the program will return -1, but it should actually return 2 operations: first to set the top-left and bottom-right elements to 1, and then to set the top-right and bottom-left elements to 1.

In general, the program needs to be modified to handle all possible cases where `B` can be made equal to `A`, not just the case where `A` contains 2x2 submatrices with all elements 1.
