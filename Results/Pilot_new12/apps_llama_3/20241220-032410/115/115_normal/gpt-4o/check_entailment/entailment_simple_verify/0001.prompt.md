You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.

                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))

        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, if we have a 3x3 matrix A with the following values:
```
1 0 1
1 1 0
0 1 1
```
The program will return -1 because it cannot find any 2x2 submatrix in A with all elements equal to 1. However, it is possible to make B equal to A by performing operations on the submatrices. 

One possible sequence of operations could be:
```
(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)
```
But the given program does not handle this case correctly. It only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1 and performs operations only on those submatrices. 

It does not consider cases where a single operation can make multiple elements of B equal to A, or where multiple operations are needed to make B equal to A. 

This is a clear example where the given program does not work as expected and therefore its correctness is **False**. 

In order to fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle more general cases and find all possible sequences of operations that can make B equal to A. 

However, according to the problem description, we don't need to find the minimum number of operations, we just need to find any sequence of operations that transforms B into A. 

The given program only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1, it doesn't consider the case where a 2x2 submatrix has three elements equal to 1 and one element equal to 0. 

In such cases, the program should perform an operation on that submatrix to make the element equal to 0 also equal to 1. 

The program should be modified to handle such cases and find any sequence of operations that transforms B into A. 

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible 2x2 submatrices of B and perform an operation on a submatrix if it has at least one element equal to 1 and the corresponding element in A is also equal to 1. 

This approach ensures that B will be transformed into A in the minimum number of operations, or at least in some number of operations. 

But again, according to the problem description, we don't need to find the minimum number of operations. 

So, the program should be modified to handle more general cases and find any sequence of operations that transforms B into A, not necessarily the minimum number of operations. 

For example, it could perform an operation on a 2x2 submatrix if it has at least one element equal to 1 and the corresponding element in A is also equal to 1. 

This way, the program will find any sequence of operations that transforms B into A, not necessarily the minimum number of operations. 

However, the given program does not handle such cases and therefore its correctness is **False**. 

In order to make it correct, it needs to be modified to handle more general cases and find any sequence of operations that transforms B into A. 

One way to do this could be to use a more complex algorithm that checks all possible 2x2 submatrices of B and performs operations on them based on the values of the corresponding elements in A. 

Another way could be to use a recursive approach where the program tries all possible operations on all possible 2x2 submatrices of B and checks if the resulting matrix is equal to A. 

But the given program does not use any of these approaches and therefore its correctness is **False**. 

It only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1 and performs operations only on those submatrices, which is not enough to handle all possible cases. 

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of operations, and either `A` is equal to `B` element-wise or the function has returned -1 if any `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`. If the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that all rows have been checked.
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
