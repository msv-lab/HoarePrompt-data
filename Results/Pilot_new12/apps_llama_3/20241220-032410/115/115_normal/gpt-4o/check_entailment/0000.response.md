Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks for submatrices of size 2x2 where all elements are 1 in matrix A and applies the operation to those submatrices. However, this approach does not cover all possible cases.

For example, consider the following input:

```
4 4
1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0
1 0 1 0
```

In this case, the program will not be able to make matrix B equal to matrix A because it only checks for submatrices of size 2x2 where all elements are 1. But, we can make matrix B equal to matrix A by applying the operation to submatrices of size 2x2 where only some elements are 1.

The program does not handle this case correctly and will return an incorrect result. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**. 

A correct solution would need to check all possible submatrices of size 2x2 and apply the operation in a way that makes matrix B equal to matrix A, if possible. This might involve using a more complex algorithm, such as a backtracking or greedy approach. 

Note that the problem statement does not require the sequence of operations to be minimal, so a correct solution could involve applying the operation to multiple submatrices, even if some of those operations are not strictly necessary. 

The key point is that the program must be able to handle all possible cases, not just the simple ones where all elements of a 2x2 submatrix are 1.
