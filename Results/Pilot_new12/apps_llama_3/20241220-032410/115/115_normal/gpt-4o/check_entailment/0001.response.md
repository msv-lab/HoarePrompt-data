Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, if we have a 3x3 matrix A with the following values:
```
1 0 1
1 1 0
0 1 1
```
The program will return -1 because it cannot find any 2x2 submatrix in A with all elements equal to 1. However, it is possible to make B equal to A by performing operations on the submatrices. 

One possible sequence of operations could be:
```
(1, 1), (1, 2), (2, 1), (2, 2)
```
But the given program does not handle this case correctly. It only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1 and performs operations only on those submatrices. 

It does not consider cases where a single operation can make multiple elements of B equal to A, or where multiple operations are needed to make B equal to A. 

This is a clear example where the given program does not work as expected and therefore its correctness is **False**. 

In order to fix this, the program needs to be modified to handle more general cases and find all possible sequences of operations that can make B equal to A. 

However, according to the problem description, we don't need to find the minimum number of operations, we just need to find any sequence of operations that transforms B into A. 

The given program only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1, it doesn't consider the case where a 2x2 submatrix has three elements equal to 1 and one element equal to 0. 

In such cases, the program should perform an operation on that submatrix to make the element equal to 0 also equal to 1. 

The program should be modified to handle such cases and find any sequence of operations that transforms B into A. 

The correct approach would be to iterate over all possible 2x2 submatrices of B and perform an operation on a submatrix if it has at least one element equal to 1 and the corresponding element in A is also equal to 1. 

This approach ensures that B will be transformed into A in the minimum number of operations, or at least in some number of operations. 

But again, according to the problem description, we don't need to find the minimum number of operations. 

So, the program should be modified to handle more general cases and find any sequence of operations that transforms B into A, not necessarily the minimum number of operations. 

For example, it could perform an operation on a 2x2 submatrix if it has at least one element equal to 1 and the corresponding element in A is also equal to 1. 

This way, the program will find any sequence of operations that transforms B into A, not necessarily the minimum number of operations. 

However, the given program does not handle such cases and therefore its correctness is **False**. 

In order to make it correct, it needs to be modified to handle more general cases and find any sequence of operations that transforms B into A. 

One way to do this could be to use a more complex algorithm that checks all possible 2x2 submatrices of B and performs operations on them based on the values of the corresponding elements in A. 

Another way could be to use a recursive approach where the program tries all possible operations on all possible 2x2 submatrices of B and checks if the resulting matrix is equal to A. 

But the given program does not use any of these approaches and therefore its correctness is **False**. 

It only checks for 2x2 submatrices with all elements equal to 1 and performs operations only on those submatrices, which is not enough to handle all possible cases. 

Therefore, the correctness of the given program is **False**.
