Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases. The issue lies in the logic of the function `func_1`. 

The function checks for sets of four adjacent elements (2x2 sub-matrix) in `A` that are all 1 and if found, it sets the corresponding elements in `B` to 1 and records the operation. However, this approach is not sufficient to make `B` equal to `A` in all cases.

For example, if `A` has a single 1 in the first row and first column, and the rest of the elements are 0, the function will not be able to make `B` equal to `A` because it only checks for 2x2 sub-matrices with all 1s.

Moreover, the function does not handle the case where `A` has a 1 in a position that cannot be covered by a 2x2 sub-matrix, such as the last row or last column. 

To correctly solve the problem, the function should use a different approach, such as using a bitmask or a more complex algorithm that can handle all possible cases.

The function also does not consider the order of operations, which is important in this problem. The problem statement allows for any sequence of operations that transforms `B` into `A`, but the function only checks for a specific sequence of operations.

Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description says, and it is incorrect.
