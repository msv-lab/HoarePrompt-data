Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50 and `m` must be greater than 0, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The current value of `A` at position `[i][j]` is not equal to the current value of `B` at position `[i][j]`.**
