Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= `m` <= 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` is 2, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, no changes are made.***
