The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `m`, and `A`. `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and 2 <= `m` <= 50. `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, where each element is either 0 or 1. After executing the function body, the function returns -1 in all specified cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, and A, where n and m are integers between 2 and 50, and A is an n by m 2D list of 0s and 1s, and returns -1.**
