According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `m` is at least 2, the loop can execute at least once. Since the loop iterates over `range(m - 1)`, for the loop to execute, `m` must be greater than 1.

Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is 0, `operations` is an empty list, `i` is 0. 

Since `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute, and `j` is the loop variable, at the start of the loop, `j` should be 0.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and m > 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is 0, `operations` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
