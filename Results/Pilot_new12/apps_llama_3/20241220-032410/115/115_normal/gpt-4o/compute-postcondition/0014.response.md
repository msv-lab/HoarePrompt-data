To calculate the output state, let's consider the impact of the code on the program and the previous values of the affected variables.

The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `m` is an integer such that `m` is at least `j + 2` and `m` <= 50
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1
- `j` is at least 2 and less than `m`
- `B` is a 2D list where `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1` and the rest of the elements in `B` have their previous values
- `operations` has its previous value

The operation `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` changes the `operations` list by adding a new element to it. The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `j`, and `B` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50
- `m` is an integer such that `m` is at least `j + 2` and `m` <= 50
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1
- `j` is at least 2 and less than `m`
- `B` is a 2D list where `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1` and the rest of the elements in `B` have their previous values
- `operations` has its previous value plus the new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` appended to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that `m` is at least `j + 2` and `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and less than `m`, `B` is a 2D list where `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1` and the rest of the elements in `B` have their previous values, `operations` is updated to include the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
