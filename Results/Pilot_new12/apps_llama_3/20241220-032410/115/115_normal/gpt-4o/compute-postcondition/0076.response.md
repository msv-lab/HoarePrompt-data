Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`**
