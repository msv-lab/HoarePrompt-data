Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 0. The current values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, meaning that the elements at positions (i, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j), and (i+1, j+1) in the 2D list `A` are all 1.**
