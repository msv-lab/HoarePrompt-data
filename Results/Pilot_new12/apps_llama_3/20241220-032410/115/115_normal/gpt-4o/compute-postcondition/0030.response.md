Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50 and `m` > 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, then `operations` is a list containing at least the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged.**
