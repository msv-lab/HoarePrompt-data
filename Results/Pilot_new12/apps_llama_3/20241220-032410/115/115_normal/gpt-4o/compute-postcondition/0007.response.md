Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and m > 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1. If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, and `i` is less than `n-1`, and `j` is less than `m-1`, then `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 and all other elements are 0, and `operations` is `[(1, 1)]`. Otherwise, `B` and `operations` remain unchanged.***
