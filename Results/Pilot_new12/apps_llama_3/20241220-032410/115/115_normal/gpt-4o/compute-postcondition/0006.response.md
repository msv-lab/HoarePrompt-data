The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a tuple containing the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the end of the `operations` list. The values of `i` and `j` are 0. 

So, `operations` becomes `[(1, 1)]`, because `i + 1` equals 1 and `j + 1` equals 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and m > 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 and all other elements are 0, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is less than `n-1`, `j` is less than `m-1`, and `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j+1]`, `A[i+1][j]`, `A[i+1][j+1]` are all 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and m > 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 and all other elements are 0, `operations` is `[(1, 1)]`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is less than `n-1`, `j` is less than `m-1`, and `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j+1]`, `A[i+1][j]`, `A[i+1][j+1]` are all 1**
