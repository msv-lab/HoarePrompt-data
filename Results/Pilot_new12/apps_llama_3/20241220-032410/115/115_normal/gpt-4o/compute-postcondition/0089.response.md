The print statement will output the first two elements of the second operation in `operations`. Since `op` is the second operation in `operations`, `op[0]` and `op[1]` will be printed. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, and `operations` are not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list with at least 2 operations, the first two elements of the second operation in `operations` (`op[0]` and `op[1]`) have been printed**
