To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(m):
    if A[i][j]!= B[i][j]:
        return -1
```
This loop iterates over the columns of the 2D lists `A` and `B` (from index 0 to `m-1`) and checks if the elements at the current position `(i, j)` are equal. If it finds a pair of elements that are not equal, the function immediately returns `-1`.

Given the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can infer the following:

- The loop will execute at least once if `m` is greater than 0.
- The loop will execute at least `k` times if `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.
- If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]` for any `j`, the function returns `-1`, indicating that the loop does not complete its scheduled iterations.
- If the loop completes all its iterations, it means that `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m-1`.

Considering these points and focusing on the loop code, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be determined as follows:

- If the loop completes all its iterations without finding any unequal elements, `j` will be `m-1` (since the loop iterates from 0 to `m-1`).
- The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, and `operations` will remain unchanged throughout the loop, as they are not modified within the loop.
- The value of `i` remains 0, as it is not changed within the loop.
- If the function has not returned `-1` after the loop, it implies that all elements compared were equal.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` is 0, and for the first row (i=0), `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m-1`, or the function has returned -1 if any `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`.**
