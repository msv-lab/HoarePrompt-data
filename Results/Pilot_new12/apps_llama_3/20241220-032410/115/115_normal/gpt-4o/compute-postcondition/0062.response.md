Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0. The current values of `i` and `j` are such that the element at position `(i, j)` in `A` is not equal to the element at position `(i, j)` in `B`, meaning `A[1][0]` is not equal to `B[1][0]`.**
