The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `j`, and `B` are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 1 and less than `m - 1`, `B` is updated such that `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, and `operations` is updated with the new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
