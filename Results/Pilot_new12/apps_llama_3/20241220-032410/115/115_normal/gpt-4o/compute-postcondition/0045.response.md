Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 50`, `m` is an integer and must be at least `4`, `A` is a `2D` list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `i` is at least `2` and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `2`. If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `operations` is updated with the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` which is equivalent to `(i + 1, 3)`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
