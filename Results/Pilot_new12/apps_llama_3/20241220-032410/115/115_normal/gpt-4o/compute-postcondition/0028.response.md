The given code is trying to update the values of a 2D list `B` based on certain conditions. However, the initial state mentions a 2D list `A` instead of `B`. Assuming that the code is meant to update the values of `A` (since `B` is not defined in the initial state), we can proceed with the analysis.

The values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are updated to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be greater than 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 2, If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` were all 1 before, then `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`.**
