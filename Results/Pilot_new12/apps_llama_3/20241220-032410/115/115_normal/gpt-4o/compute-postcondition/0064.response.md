Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` is 1, and `j` is 0. Additionally, the element at position (1,0) in `A` is equal to the element at position (1,0) in `B`, i.e., `A[1][0] == B[1][0]`.**
