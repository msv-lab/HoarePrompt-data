Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 1. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, then `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, no additional operations are performed.***
