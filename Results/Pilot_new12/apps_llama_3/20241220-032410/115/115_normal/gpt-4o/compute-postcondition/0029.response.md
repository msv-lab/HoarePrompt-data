The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. Given the initial state conditions that `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1 and `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 2, and `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= `n` <= 50 and 2 <= `m` <= 50 with `m` > 3, and considering `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, the impact of the code on the program is the addition of a new tuple to the `operations` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50 and `m` > 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 2, `operations` is a list containing at least the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
