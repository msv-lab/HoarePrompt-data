The given code seems to be referencing a 2D list `B`, but the initial state mentions a 2D list `A`. Assuming the intent was to modify `A` instead of `B`, the code would affect the elements of `A` at positions `[i][j]`, `[i][j + 1]`, `[i + 1][j]`, and `[i + 1][j + 1]`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 50
- `m` is an integer and must be at least 3
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns
- `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`
- `j` is 1

And the operation:
```
A[i][j] = A[i][j + 1] = A[i + 1][j] = A[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
```

The values of `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all set to 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `i`, `j`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j] = A[i][j + 1] = A[i + 1][j] = A[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 1**
