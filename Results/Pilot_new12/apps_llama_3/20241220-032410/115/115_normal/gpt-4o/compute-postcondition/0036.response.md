The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple containing the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1` to the `operations` list. 

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 50
- `m` is an integer and must be at least 2
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1
- `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`
- `j` is 0
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1
- `operations` is a list of operations containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each set of elements in `A` that met the condition.

Since `j` is 0 and `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, and given that `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, and that `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, after the operation, `operations` will contain an additional tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` which translates to `(i + 1, 1)`, because `j` is 0 and `j + 1` equals 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 0, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, and `operations` is a list of operations containing tuples including `(i + 1, 1)`**
