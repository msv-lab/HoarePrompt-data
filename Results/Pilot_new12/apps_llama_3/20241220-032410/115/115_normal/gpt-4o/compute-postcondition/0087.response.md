The given code prints the first two elements of the `op` list. The `op` list is the first operation in the `operations` list. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, `operations`, and `op` are not changed by the code, so they remain the same. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is not empty, `op` is the first operation in `operations`, the first element of `op` and the second element of `op` have been printed, and either `A` is equal to `B` element-wise or the function has returned -1 if any `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`.**
