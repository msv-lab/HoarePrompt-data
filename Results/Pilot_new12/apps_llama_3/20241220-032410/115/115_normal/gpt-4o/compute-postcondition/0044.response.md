The value of `operations` is updated by appending a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given that `i` is at least `2` and less than `n - 1`, and `j` is `2`, we can deduce that `i + 1` is at least `3` and less than `n`, and `j + 1` is `3`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 50`, `m` is an integer and must be at least `4`, `A` is a `2D` list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][2] = A[i][3] = A[i + 1][2] = A[i + 1][3] = 1`, `i` is at least `2` and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `2`, and `operations` is updated with the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` which is equivalent to `(i + 1, 3)`**
