The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a new operation to the list of operations. The new operation is a tuple containing the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`.

Since `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, and `j` is 0, the new operation will be a tuple containing values between 2 and `n` for the first element and 1 for the second element.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `operations` is a list of operations with a new operation (`i + 1, j + 1`) appended to it, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, and `j` is 0, and the elements at positions (i, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j), and (i+1, j+1) in `A` are all 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `operations` is a list of operations including (`i + 1, j + 1`), `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 0, and the elements at positions (i, j), (i, j+1), (i+1, j), and (i+1, j+1) in `A` are all 1**
