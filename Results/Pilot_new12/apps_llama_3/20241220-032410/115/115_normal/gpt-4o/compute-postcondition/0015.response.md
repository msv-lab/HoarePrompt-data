Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that `m` is at least `j + 2` and `m` <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 2 and less than `m`. If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `B` is a 2D list where `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1` and the rest of the elements in `B` have their previous values, and `operations` is updated to include the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, `B` and `operations` retain their previous values.**
