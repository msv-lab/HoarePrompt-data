Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 4 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer and must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 0, the current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, the current value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, and `operations` is a list of operations containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each set of elements in `A` that met the condition.**
