According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 2`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1. 
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 1**
