To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for j in range(m - 1):`. This means that the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` becomes 2. Since the loop condition is `j` in `range(m - 1)`, for the loop to execute again, `m` must be greater than 2 + 1, i.e., `m` must be greater than 3.

No changes are required for `n`, `A`, `i`, or `operations` as the loop condition only depends on `j` and `m`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and `m` must be greater than 3, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 2. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all 1, then `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, no additional operations are performed.**
