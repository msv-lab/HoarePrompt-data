Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50 and `m` > 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
