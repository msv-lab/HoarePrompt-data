Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 0. If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1` and `operations` is a list of operations including (`i + 1, j + 1`); otherwise, the state of `B` and `operations` remains unchanged.**
