To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is a `for` loop that iterates over the `operations` list. At the end of the previous iteration, we know that the first two elements of the second operation in `operations` (`op[0]` and `op[1]`) have been printed. This implies that the loop has already executed at least once, and the current operation `op` is the second operation in the list.

For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more operation in the `operations` list. Since the list has at least 2 operations and we have already executed the second operation, the list must have at least 3 operations for the loop to execute again.

The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, and `B` do not affect the execution of the loop, as the loop iterates over the `operations` list. However, their state remains unchanged, as the loop body is omitted and we do not have any information about how these variables are modified within the loop.

Considering these points, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list with at least 3 operations**
