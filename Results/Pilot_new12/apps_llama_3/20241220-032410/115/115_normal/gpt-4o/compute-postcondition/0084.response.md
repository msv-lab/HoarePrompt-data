To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if A[i][j]!= B[i][j]:
            return -1
```
The loop iterates over each element in the 2D lists `A` and `B`. If it finds any pair of elements at the same position `[i][j]` that are not equal, it immediately returns `-1`.

From the output states after a few iterations, we can infer the following:

- After the first iteration, `i` is 0, and `A[0][j]` must be equal to `B[0][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m-1`, or the function has returned `-1`.
- After the second iteration, `i` is 1, and `A[1][j]` must be equal to `B[1][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m-1`, or the function has returned `-1`.
- This pattern continues for each row `i` in the 2D lists.

Considering the loop will execute for all rows and columns unless it finds a mismatch and returns `-1`, we can conclude the following about the output state after all iterations:

- If the loop completes without returning `-1`, it means every element in `A` is equal to the corresponding element in `B`. In this case, `i` will be `n` (because the loop iterates over `range(n)`, and after the loop finishes, `i` takes the value of `n`), and `j` is not defined at this point because the inner loop has finished.
- The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, and `operations` do not change during the execution of the loop. `n` and `m` remain the dimensions of `A` and `B`, and `operations` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of operations, and either `A` is equal to `B` element-wise or the function has returned -1 if any `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`. If the loop completes, `i` will be equal to `n`, indicating that all rows have been checked.**
