To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for j in range(m):`, which means the loop will execute for each column index `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50
- `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50 and `m` > 1
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns
- `operations` is a list of operations
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 1

Since the loop iterates over the columns (indexed by `j`), for the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration:
- `j` should be 2, because the loop will move to the next column index.

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, `operations`, `i`) do not change because they are not directly related to the loop variable `j`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50 and `m` > 2, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2**
