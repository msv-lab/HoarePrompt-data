The code creates a new 2D list `B` with the same number of rows `n` and columns `m` as the existing 2D list `A`. Each element in `B` is initialized to 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is 0, `operations` is an empty list**
