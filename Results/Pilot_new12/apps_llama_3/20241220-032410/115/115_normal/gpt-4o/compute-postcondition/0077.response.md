To determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 50
- `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50
- `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1
- `operations` is a list of operations
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 0
- `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`

The loop statement is `for j in range(m):`. This means the loop iterates over the columns of the 2D lists `A` and `B`, and its execution depends on the value of `j` relative to `m`.

Since `j` is 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again:
- `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes 1.
- The value of `m` must be greater than 1 to allow another iteration.

Thus, the state adjustments are:
- `j` increments to 1.
- The condition for `m` remains that it must be between 2 and 50 (inclusive), but since we are looking at the next iteration, `m` must specifically be greater than 1 to allow `j` to reach 1.

Other variables (`n`, `A`, `B`, `operations`, `i`, and the relationship between `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]`) do not directly affect the loop's condition for the next iteration, given the loop statement provided.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50 and `m` > 1, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
