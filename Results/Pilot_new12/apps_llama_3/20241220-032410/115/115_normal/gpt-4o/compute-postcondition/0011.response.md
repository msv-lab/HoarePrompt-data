Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `j` is at least 1 and less than `m - 1`. If `A[i][j] == 1` and `A[i][j + 1] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j] == 1` and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1`, then `B` is updated such that `B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, and `operations` is updated with the new tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Otherwise, `B` and `operations` remain unchanged.***
