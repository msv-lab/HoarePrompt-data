The values of `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are updated to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is still an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and m > 1, `A` is still a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is still an empty list, `i` is still 0, and `j` is still 0. The current values of `i` and `j` are such that `i` is less than `n-1` and `j` is less than `m-1`, and the current state of `A` at positions `(i, j)`, `(i, j+1)`, `(i+1, j)`, and `(i+1, j+1)` are all 1. `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 and all other elements are 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50 and m > 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 and all other elements are 0, `operations` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `i` is less than `n-1`, `j` is less than `m-1`, and `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j+1]`, `A[i+1][j]`, `A[i+1][j+1]` are all 1**
