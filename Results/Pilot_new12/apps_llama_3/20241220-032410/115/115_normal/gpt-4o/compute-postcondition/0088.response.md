According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `operations` list. If the list has at least 2 operations, the loop executes again for the second operation. At the end of the last iteration, `operations` is not empty, `op` is the first operation in `operations`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `operations` must have at least 2 operations and `op` must be the second operation in `operations`. The state of `n`, `m`, `A`, and `B` remains the same as the loop body does not affect these variables' existence, but their values could have changed. However, the condition that either `A` is equal to `B` element-wise or the function has returned -1 if any `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]` should still hold, but this is not directly related to the loop execution.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list with at least 2 operations, `op` is the second operation in `operations`**
