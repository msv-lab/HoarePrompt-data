The given Python code snippet appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `operations`. The initial state specifies the following conditions: `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 50`, `m` is an integer and must be at least `3`, `A` is a `2D` list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j] = A[i][j + 1] = A[i + 1][j] = A[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `i` is at least `2` and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `1`. 

The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` does not modify the values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, or `j`. It only updates the `operations` list by adding a new tuple that contains the incremented values of `i` and `j`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 50`, `m` is an integer and must be at least `3`, `A` is a `2D` list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j] = A[i][j + 1] = A[i + 1][j] = A[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `i` is at least `2` and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `1`, and `operations` is a list that contains a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` in addition to its previous content.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 50`, `m` is an integer and must be at least `3`, `A` is a `2D` list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j] = A[i][j + 1] = A[i + 1][j] = A[i + 1][j + 1] = 1`, `i` is at least `2` and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `1`, `operations` is a list that contains a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` in addition to its previous content**
