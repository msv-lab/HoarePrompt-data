The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a tuple to the `operations` list. The tuple contains the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. 

Since `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, and `j` is 1, `i + 1` will be at least 2 and less than `n`, and `j + 1` will be 2.

The `operations` list now contains the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`, in addition to any elements it may have had before. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer between 2 and 50, `m` is still an integer between 2 and 50, `A` is still a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 and other elements can be either 0 or 1, `i` is still at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, and `j` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 and other elements can be either 0 or 1, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is 1, and `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)`**
