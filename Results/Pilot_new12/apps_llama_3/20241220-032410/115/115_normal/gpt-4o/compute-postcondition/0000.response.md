The given code initializes an empty list `operations`. This list is initially empty and does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or the 2D list `A`. 

The initial conditions for `n` and `m` are that they are integers between 2 and 50 (inclusive), and `A` is a 2D list with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1.

Since the code only introduces a new variable `operations` without modifying the existing variables, the values of `n`, `m`, and `A` remain unchanged. The new variable `operations` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n <= 50 and 2 <= m <= 50, A is a 2D list of integers with n rows and m columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is an empty list**
