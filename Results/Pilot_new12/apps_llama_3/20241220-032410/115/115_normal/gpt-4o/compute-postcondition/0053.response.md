According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0 and `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1 and `m` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= `m` <= 50 and `m` must be greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.**
