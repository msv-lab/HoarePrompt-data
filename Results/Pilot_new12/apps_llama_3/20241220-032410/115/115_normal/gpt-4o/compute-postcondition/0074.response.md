Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= `n` <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= `m` <= 50, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each element is either 0 or 1, `operations` is a list of operations, `i` equals 2, and `j` equals 0. The current values of `A` and `B` at position [2][0] are different, i.e., `A[2][0]` is not equal to `B[2][0]`.**
