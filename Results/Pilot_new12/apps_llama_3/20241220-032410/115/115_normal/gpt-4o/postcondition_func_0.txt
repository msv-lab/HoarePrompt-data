The function accepts parameters n, m, and A, where n and m are integers between 2 and 50, and A is an n by m 2D list of 0s and 1s. It checks for sets of four adjacent elements (2x2 sub-matrix) in A that are all 1, and if found, it sets the corresponding elements in a new 2D list B to 1 and records the operation. After all operations are processed, it checks if A is equal to B element-wise. If any elements are not equal, it returns -1. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations performed and the coordinates of each operation, and then terminates without returning a value explicitly. The function does not handle cases where n or m are outside the specified range or A contains values other than 0 or 1, and it does not modify the input list A. The function's primary action is to compare A and B, and its outcome depends on the equality of these two lists, with a return value of -1 if they are not equal, and the printing of operation details if they are equal.
