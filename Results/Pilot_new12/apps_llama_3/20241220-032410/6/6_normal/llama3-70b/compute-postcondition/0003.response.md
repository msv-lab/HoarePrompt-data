The code `ans += l - pos` increments the value of `ans` by the difference between `l` and `pos`. Given the initial state, `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers, `ans` is 0, and `pos` is less than `l`, the new value of `ans` will be `l - pos`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `pos` is an integer and less than `l`, `l` is an integer, `r` is an integer, and `ans` is `l - pos`.**
