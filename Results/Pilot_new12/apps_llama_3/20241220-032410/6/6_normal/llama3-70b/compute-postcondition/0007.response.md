Postcondition: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers. If `pos` is not less than `l`, `ans` is 0. If `pos` is less than `l`, then `ans` is `l - pos`. Additionally, if `pos` is greater than `r`, `ans` is updated to `pos - r`. Otherwise, `ans` remains as previously determined by the relationship between `pos` and `l`.**
