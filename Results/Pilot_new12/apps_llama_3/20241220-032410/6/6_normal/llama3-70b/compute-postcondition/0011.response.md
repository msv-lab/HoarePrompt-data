Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the minimum number of moves required to reach a target position within a given range, considering the constraints of the input parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. The function accepts these parameters as integers, where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`. It then determines the minimum distance to move the position `pos` within the range `[l, r]` and to the closest boundary of the range `[1, n]`, accounting for the minimum number of moves required to adjust `pos` to be within the range `[l, r]` and to move towards the closest end of the range `[1, n]`. The function returns the total number of moves required, considering all potential edge cases, including when `pos` is less than `l`, greater than `r`, or within the range `[l, r]`.**
