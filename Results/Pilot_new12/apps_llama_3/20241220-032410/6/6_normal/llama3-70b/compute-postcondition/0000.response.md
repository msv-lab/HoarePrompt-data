The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are updated based on the input. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of strings, and `map(int,...)` converts each string in the list to an integer. The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` can be any integers, as long as the input provides four integers. The constraints from the initial state (1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= pos <= n, 1 <= l <= r <= n) are no longer guaranteed, as the new values come from the input.

Output State: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers assigned from the input, where `n` = first input integer, `pos` = second input integer, `l` = third input integer, `r` = fourth input integer**
