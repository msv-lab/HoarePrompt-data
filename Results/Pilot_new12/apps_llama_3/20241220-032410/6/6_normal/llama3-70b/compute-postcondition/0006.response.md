The value of `ans` is updated by adding `pos - r` to it. Since `pos` is greater than `r`, `pos - r` is a positive value. 

The initial value of `ans` is determined based on the relationship between `pos` and `l`: if `pos` is not less than `l`, then `ans` is 0, otherwise `ans` is `l - pos`. However, we are given that the current value of `pos` is greater than `r`, and there is no restriction on the relationship between `pos` and `l` after this update. But initially, `pos` is greater than `r` which implies `pos` is not less than `l` because `r` is typically greater than or equal to `l`. 

Thus, the value of `ans` was 0, and now `ans` becomes `0 + (pos - r)` which simplifies to `pos - r`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `pos` is greater than `r`, `l` and `r` are integers, and `ans` is `pos - r`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `pos` is greater than `r`, `l` and `r` are integers, and `ans` is `pos - r`.**
