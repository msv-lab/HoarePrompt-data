The function `func` seems to be missing its parameters, but based on the provided constraints, it should accept parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= pos <= n, 1 <= l <= r <= n. 

However, since the output and behavior of the function are not specified, we cannot determine the return value of the function.


Please provide the function body and the output constraints to determine the functionality of the function.


Given that we have no information about the output, the description of the functionality of the function can only include the input parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, pos, l, and r, which are integers with specific constraints: 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= pos <= n, 1 <= l <= r <= n.**
