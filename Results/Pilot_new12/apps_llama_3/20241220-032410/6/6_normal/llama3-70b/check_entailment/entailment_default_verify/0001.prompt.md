You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds Luba needs to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened.

For example, consider the input `6 6 2 4`. The code calculates `ans` as follows:
- `pos < l` is False, so `ans` remains 0.
- `pos > r` is True, so `ans` becomes `ans + pos - r = 0 + 6 - 4 = 2`.
- `ans` becomes `ans + min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1) = 2 + min(5, 2) + max(0, 1) = 2 + 2 + 1 = 5`.

However, the correct answer is 4. The correct steps are:
1. Move the cursor to the tab 5 (1 step).
2. Close all the tabs to the right of the cursor (1 step).
3. Move the cursor to the tab 4 (1 step).
4. Move the cursor to the tab 3 and then 2 (2 steps).
5. Close all the tabs to the left of the cursor (1 step).

The provided code does not consider all possible steps and does not calculate the minimum number of seconds correctly.

Another example is `8 8 3 6`, where the code also fails to calculate the minimum number of seconds correctly.

The code does not take into account the optimal strategy for closing tabs, which is to always close tabs on one side of the cursor and then move the cursor to the other side to close the remaining tabs. The code's calculation of `min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)` is not correct in all cases and does not consider the optimal strategy. 

In general, the code does not correctly implement the problem description and does not calculate the minimum number of seconds correctly for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and returns the minimum number of moves required to reach a target position within a given range, considering the constraints of the input parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. The function accepts these parameters as integers, where `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, and `1 <= l <= r <= n`. It then determines the minimum distance to move the position `pos` within the range `[l, r]` and to the closest boundary of the range `[1, n]`, accounting for the minimum number of moves required to adjust `pos` to be within the range `[l, r]` and to move towards the closest end of the range `[1, n]`. The function returns the total number of moves required, considering all potential edge cases, including when `pos` is less than `l`, greater than `r`, or within the range `[l, r]`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
