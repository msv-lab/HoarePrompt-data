Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Let's consider an example where `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is not equal to `n`. The program calculates the minimum number of seconds to move to either `l` or `r` and then close the remaining tabs. However, the problem description allows for the possibility of closing all tabs to the left or right of the cursor in a single operation, potentially reducing the total number of seconds.

In the given code, when `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is not equal to `n`, the program calculates `close_both_sides` as the minimum of `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`. However, this calculation assumes that after moving to either `l` or `r`, the remaining tabs are closed in two separate operations (one to the left and one to the right). This is not necessarily the optimal approach.

A more optimal strategy could be to move the cursor to either `l` or `r` and then close all the tabs to one side in a single operation, which would reduce the total number of seconds.

For instance, let's say `n = 10`, `pos = 5`, `l = 3`, and `r = 7`. The program would calculate `close_both_sides` as the minimum of `abs(5 - 3) + (7 - 3 + 2)` and `abs(5 - 7) + (7 - 3 + 2)`, resulting in a value of `7`. However, a more optimal strategy would be to move the cursor to `l` (3 steps), and then close all the tabs to the right of `r` (1 step), and finally close all the tabs to the left of `l` (1 step), resulting in a total of `5` steps.

Therefore, the program does not always follow the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
