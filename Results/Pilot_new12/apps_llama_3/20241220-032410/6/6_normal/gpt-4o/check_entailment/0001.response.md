Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem as described. 

For instance, consider the input `6 1 2 5`. The cursor is at the first tab and Luba needs to leave tabs from the second to the fifth open. 

In this case, the optimal solution is: move the cursor to the right until it reaches the last tab to be kept (tab 5), then close all tabs to the right of it (none), and finally close all tabs to the left of it (tab 1). This would result in 4 operations (3 to move the cursor and 1 to close the left tabs).

However, the program calculates this scenario as follows:
- `move_to_l = abs(pos - l) = abs(1 - 2) = 1`
- `move_to_r = abs(pos - r) = abs(1 - 5) = 4`
- `close_both_sides = min(move_to_l + (r - l + 2), move_to_r + (r - l + 2)) = min(1 + 6, 4 + 6) = min(7, 10) = 7`

The program's answer is 7, which is incorrect. The correct answer is 4 (move 4 times to the right and then close the tabs to the left).

This example illustrates that the program does not fully capture the complexity of the problem and does not always provide the optimal solution.
