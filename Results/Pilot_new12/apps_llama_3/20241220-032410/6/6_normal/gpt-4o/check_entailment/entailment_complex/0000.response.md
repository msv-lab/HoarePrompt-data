Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description in all cases. 

The problem description requires the program to calculate the minimum number of seconds required to close all tabs outside the segment [l, r]. The program, however, only considers the case when the cursor is moved to either the left or right boundary of the segment and then closes all tabs outside the segment.

In the case when `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is not equal to `n`, the program calculates the minimum of two options: moving to the left boundary and then to the right boundary, or moving to the right boundary and then to the left boundary, both of which account for the distance between the boundaries plus two. However, this does not consider the optimal solution when the cursor is moved to the left boundary and then closes all tabs to the right of it, or when the cursor is moved to the right boundary and then closes all tabs to the left of it.

For example, consider the input `6 3 2 4`. The program calculates `move_to_l = abs(3 - 2) = 1`, `move_to_r = abs(3 - 4) = 1`, `close_both_sides = min(1 + (4 - 2 + 2), 1 + (4 - 2 + 2)) = 4`, and prints `4`. However, the optimal solution is to move the cursor to tab 2, close all tabs to the left of it (1 tab), move the cursor to tab 4, and then close all tabs to the right of it (1 tab), which takes `1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 5` seconds, as correctly given in the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description in all cases and is incorrect.
