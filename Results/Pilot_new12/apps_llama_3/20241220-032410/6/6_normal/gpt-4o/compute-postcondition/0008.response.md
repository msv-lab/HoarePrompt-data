The value of `n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer. The program prints the absolute difference between `pos` and `l` plus 1, i.e., `abs(pos - l) + 1`. The states of the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are not affected by the print statement. However, a value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been returned and printed at the output.

Output State: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `r` equals `n`, `l` is not equal to 1, and a value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been returned and printed at the output.**
