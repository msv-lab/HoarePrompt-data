The given code snippet simply prints the value of `close_both_sides`. It does not modify any variables. 

`close_both_sides` equals `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`. This value has been calculated and is printed out.

The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, `r`, `move_to_l`, and `move_to_r` remain unchanged, and the constraints on these variables are still valid.

`close_both_sides` has been returned at the output state.

Output State: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n`, `l` is not equal to 1, `r` is not equal to `n`, `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` equals `abs(pos - r)`, `close_both_sides` equals `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, and `close_both_sides` has been returned**
