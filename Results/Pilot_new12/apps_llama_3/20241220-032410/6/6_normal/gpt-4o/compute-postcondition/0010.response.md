To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` equals the first input integer.
- `pos` equals the second input integer.
- `l` equals the third input integer.
- `r` equals the fourth input integer.
- `1 <= n <= 100`.
- `1 <= pos <= n`.
- `1 <= l <= r <= n`.
- Either `l` is not equal to 1 or `r` is not equal to `n`.
- Specifically, `l` is not equal to 1, and `r` is not equal to `n`.

The code snippet is:
```python
move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
```

This line of code calculates the absolute difference between the current position (`pos`) and the left boundary (`l`), and assigns this value to `move_to_l`.

Given the constraints:
- `l` is not equal to 1.
- `r` is not equal to `n`.
- `1 <= pos <= n`.
- `1 <= l <= r <= n`.

The new variable `move_to_l` will be the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`, which means it will be a non-negative integer because `abs()` function returns the absolute value of a number.

Since `l` and `pos` are both within the range from 1 to `n`, and `l` is not 1 and `r` is not `n`, we know `move_to_l` will be at least 0 (if `pos` equals `l`) and at most `n-1` (if `pos` is 1 and `l` is `n`, or vice versa, but given `l` and `r` constraints, `l` cannot be `n` and `r` cannot be 1, so the actual maximum will depend on the specific values of `pos` and `l`).

Therefore, the output state, considering all given constraints and the effect of the code, is:
- `n` equals the first input integer.
- `pos` equals the second input integer.
- `l` equals the third input integer.
- `r` equals the fourth input integer.
- `1 <= n <= 100`.
- `1 <= pos <= n`.
- `1 <= l <= r <= n`.
- `l` is not equal to 1.
- `r` is not equal to `n`.
- `move_to_l` equals the absolute difference between `pos` and `l`.

Output State: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, `1 <= n <= 100`, `1 <= pos <= n`, `1 <= l <= r <= n`, `l` is not equal to 1, `r` is not equal to `n`, and `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)`**
