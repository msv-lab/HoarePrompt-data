Postcondition: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, and 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `l` is equal to 1, and since `l` is 1, `r` is not equal to `n`, the current value of `r` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to `n` but not equal to `n`, and the current value of `pos` is between 1 and `n` inclusive**
