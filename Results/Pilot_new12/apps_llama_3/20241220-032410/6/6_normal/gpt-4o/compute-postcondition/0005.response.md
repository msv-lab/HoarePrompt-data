The code prints the absolute difference between `pos` and `r` plus 1. Since `pos` is between 1 and `n` inclusive, and `r` is between 1 and `n` but not equal to `n`, the value of `abs(pos - r)` will be between 0 and `n-1` inclusive. 

Adding 1 to this value will result in a value between 1 and `n` inclusive. 

The states of the variables `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are not changed by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals 1, `r` equals the fourth input integer and is not equal to `n`, and the value `abs(pos - r) + 1` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals 1, `r` equals the fourth input integer and is not equal to `n`, and the value `abs(pos - r) + 1` has been printed**
