Postcondition: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, and 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, and either `l` is not equal to 1 or `r` is not equal to `n`, and `l` is not equal to 1, and `r` is not equal to `n`**
