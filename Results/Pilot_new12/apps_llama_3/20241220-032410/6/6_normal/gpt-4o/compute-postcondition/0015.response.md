Postcondition: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, and either `l` is not equal to 1 or `r` is not equal to `n`. If `l` equals 1 and `r` is not equal to `n`, then the value `abs(pos - r) + 1` has been printed. If `l` is not equal to 1, then if `r` equals `n`, the value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been returned and printed, otherwise, the minimum value between `abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2)` and `abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2)` has been returned.**
