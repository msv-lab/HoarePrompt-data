Postcondition: ***`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`, `l` is not equal to 1, if `r` equals `n`, then a value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been returned and printed at the output, otherwise, `move_to_l` equals `abs(pos - l)`, `move_to_r` equals `abs(pos - r)`, `close_both_sides` equals `min(abs(pos - l) + (r - l + 2), abs(pos - r) + (r - l + 2))`, and `close_both_sides` has been returned***
