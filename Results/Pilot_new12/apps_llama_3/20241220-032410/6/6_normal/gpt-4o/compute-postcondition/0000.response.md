The values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are updated to the input integers. The `map` function applies `int` to each item in the input, which is split into a list of strings using the `split` method. The `input` function accepts a line of input from the user.

The previous constraints on the values of `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are still valid, as the input is expected to be within these ranges. 

The output state is: `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that `n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, and the constraints 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n` are expected to hold.

Output State: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, and 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`.**
