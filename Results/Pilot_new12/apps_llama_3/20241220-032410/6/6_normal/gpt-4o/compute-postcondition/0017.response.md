The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r`. `n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`. However, the output description is missing. 

To provide a complete answer, I would need the output description. Since it's not provided, I'll give a general description based on the given parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, pos, l, and r, which are integers within specific ranges, but the return value is unspecified.**
