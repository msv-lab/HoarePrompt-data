Postcondition: **`n` equals the first input integer, `pos` equals the second input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, and 1 <= `n` <= 100, 1 <= `pos` <= `n`, 1 <= `l` <= `r` <= `n`. The current values of `l` and `r` are 1 and `n` respectively, meaning the range from `l` to `r` spans the entire length of `n`.**
