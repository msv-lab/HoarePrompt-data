Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly implement the problem description. It only checks for swaps where a 'G' is followed immediately by an 'S', whereas the problem statement allows for a swap of any two trophies, not necessarily adjacent. The code should check all possible swaps of a 'G' and an 'S', not just the ones where the 'S' immediately follows the 'G'.

For example, if the input is "GSGGGGS", the code will not correctly calculate the maximum beauty score because it will not consider the swap of the first 'G' with the last 'S', which would result in the sequence "SSGGGGS" and then after another swap "GGGGGGS" with a maximum beauty score of 5. However, the code will only consider the swap of the second 'G' with the third 'S', resulting in a maximum beauty score of 4, which is incorrect.

The code needs to be modified to check all possible swaps of a 'G' and an 'S', not just the ones where the 'S' immediately follows the 'G'. This can be done by iterating over all possible pairs of indices and checking if a 'G' is at the first index and an 'S' is at the second index, and then calculating the maximum beauty score after swapping these two characters.
