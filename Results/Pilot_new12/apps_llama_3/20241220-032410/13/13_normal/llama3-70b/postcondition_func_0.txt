The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters as input, and returns the maximum beauty score, which is the maximum number of consecutive 'G' characters that can be achieved either with no swaps or with one swap of a 'G' and an 'S' that immediately follows it, ignoring any 'S' characters that do not follow a 'G' character. The function handles edge cases such as an empty string, a string with no 'G' characters, a string with no 'S' characters, and a string where 'G' and 'S' characters are alternating. The final state of the program after it concludes is that it has printed the maximum beauty score based on the input parameters.
