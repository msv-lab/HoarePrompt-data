Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 3`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, `i` has completed its iterations and `i` < `n - 3`, `j` equals `i + 3`, if `s[j]` equals 'G', then `beauty` equals `beauty + 1`, otherwise the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
