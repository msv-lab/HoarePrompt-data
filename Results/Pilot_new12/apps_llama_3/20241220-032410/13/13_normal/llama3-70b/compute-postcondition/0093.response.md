To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the provided program state before the loop starts.

The loop statement is:
```
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
```
This indicates that the loop will iterate from `i - 1` down to `0`, decrementing `j` by `1` each time.

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S',
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `right` equals `n`,
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`,
- `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence,
- `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string,
- If `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `beauty`,
- `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`,
- `j` is equal to the index where the loop last checked or `n` if it checked all the way to the end without finding an 'S',
- `beauty` is 1.

For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0 because the loop starts from `i - 1`. Since `i` is already stated to be at least 1, this condition is inherently satisfied. The loop will iterate as long as `i - 1` is greater than or equal to 0, meaning `i` must be at least 1, which is given.

Thus, considering the loop's execution depends on `i` being greater than 0 and given that `i` is at least 1, the states that need adjustment or clarification for the loop to execute are mostly related to ensuring `i` is within a valid range for the loop to start and that `j` is properly initialized for the loop's first iteration.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `beauty` if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is initialized to `i - 1` for the loop to start, `beauty` is 1**
