The code sets `curr_beauty` to 0. The previous values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `right` are not changed by this operation. The value of `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`, and since `curr_beauty` is now 0, `max_beauty` is also 0. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1, `right` is less than `n`, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `right`**
