The code increments the value of `left` by 1. The initial state specifies that `left` is 2 and less than `right`, and `right` is at least 3 and greater than `left`. After the increment, `left` becomes 3. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' with `s[left]` being 'S' after update, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 3 and less than `right`, `right` must be at least 3 and greater than `left`, with `right` positioned at a character that is 'S'**
