To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):`, which means `j` will start at `i - 1` and decrease by 1 in each iteration until it reaches -1.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `right` equals `n`
- `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found
- `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations
- `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`
- `i` is at least 2
- `j` is `i - 2`
- If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` equals 3, otherwise if the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S' and we don't break out of the loop, then `beauty` equals 2, or if we break out of the loop, then `beauty` equals 1 and the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S'.

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value in the sequence, which is `i - 3`, because the loop iterates in reverse order.

The conditions for `beauty` are dependent on the character at index `j` in `s`. Since `j` decreases by 1, the new `j` will be `i - 3`. 

The states that need adjustment are:
- `j` becomes `i - 3`.
- The character at index `j` in `s` could be either 'G' or 'S', depending on the string `s`. If `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` could equal 3; if `s[j]` is 'S', `beauty` could be 1 or 2 depending on whether the loop breaks or not.

However, the exact value of `beauty` cannot be determined without the specific value of `s[j]`. But we can infer that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 3, since `j` needs to be `i - 3` and still be a valid index.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is at least 3, `j` is `i - 3`**
