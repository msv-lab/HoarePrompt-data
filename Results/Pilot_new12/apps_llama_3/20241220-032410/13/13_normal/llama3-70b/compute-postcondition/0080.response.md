According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `j` is `i + 2`, and `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `i + 3`. 

State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3**
