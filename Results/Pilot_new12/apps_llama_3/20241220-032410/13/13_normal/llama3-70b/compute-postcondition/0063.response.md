The code snippet provided is a break statement, which means it will exit the current loop or conditional statement it is enclosed within. This break statement does not modify any variables or their values. It merely changes the flow of the program by stopping the execution of the current loop or if statement it is directly inside.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `right` equals `n`
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`
- `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence
- `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string
- `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0
- `i` must be at least 1
- `j` equals `i - 1`
- The current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and at index `i + 1` is 'S'
- `beauty` equals 1
- The character at index `j` in `s` is not 'G'

After the break statement, the values of the variables do not change, but the flow of the program is altered as we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` must be at least 1, `j` equals `i - 1`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and at index `i + 1` is 'S', `beauty` equals 1, the character at index `j` in `s` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
