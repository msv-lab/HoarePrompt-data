Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` has completed its iterations and `i` < `n - 2` for the loop to have executed, `j` is either the index of the first 'S' encountered after `i + 2` or equals `n` if no 'S' is found, and `beauty` equals the count of consecutive 'G's from index `i + 2` until the first 'S' is encountered or the end of the string is reached**.
