Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0. If the character at index `right` in `s` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is 1. If the character at index `right` in `s` is 'S', then `left` is either equal to `right` or points to the first 'G' character in `s`, `right` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to the original value of `left`. If `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is `curr_beauty + 1`. If `left` is not less than `right`, the state of the program remains unchanged with respect to `curr_beauty`, and `curr_beauty` remains 0.***
