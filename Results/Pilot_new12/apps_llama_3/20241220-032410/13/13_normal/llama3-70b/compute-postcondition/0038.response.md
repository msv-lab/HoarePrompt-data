According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is less than `n`, and `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `right` must be increased by 1. So, `right` is now the old value of `right` plus 1, and for the loop to execute again, `right` must be less than `n`. This implies that `n` must be greater than the new value of `right`.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1, `right` is less than `n`, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `right`**
