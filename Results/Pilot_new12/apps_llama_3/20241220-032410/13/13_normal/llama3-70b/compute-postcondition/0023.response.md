According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is at some index, and we need to consider what happens when `right` is incremented by 1.

Since `right` is now at the next index, we need to update the state accordingly. If the character at the new index `right` in `s` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is reset to 1. If the character at the new index `right` in `s` is 'S', then `left` is either equal to the new `right` or points to the first 'G' character in `s`, and `curr_beauty` is 0 if `left` is not less than `right`, or `curr_beauty` is `curr_beauty + 1` if `left` is less than `right`. However, we cannot determine the exact value of `curr_beauty` without knowing the exact values of `left` and `right`, so we will focus on the conditions that allow the loop to execute again.

For the loop to execute again, `right` must be less than `n`, so we increment `right` by 1. The new value of `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1. 

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1, and `right` is less than `n`**
