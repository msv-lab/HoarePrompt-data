The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `curr_beauty` is not given in the initial state. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1, `right` is less than `n`, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `right`, `curr_beauty` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1, `right` is less than `n`, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `right`, `curr_beauty` is the old value of `curr_beauty` plus 1**
