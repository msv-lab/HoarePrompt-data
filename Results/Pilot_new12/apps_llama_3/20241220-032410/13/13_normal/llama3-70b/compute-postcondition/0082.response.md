The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The states of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `i`, and `j` are not affected, but the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 
Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
