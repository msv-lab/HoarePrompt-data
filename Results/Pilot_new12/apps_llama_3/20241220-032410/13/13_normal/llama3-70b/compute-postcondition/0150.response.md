The `break` statement is used to exit the loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. Since there are no changes made to the variables in the given code, all variables retain their original values. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with the addition of breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 2` or the next index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found at that position, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
