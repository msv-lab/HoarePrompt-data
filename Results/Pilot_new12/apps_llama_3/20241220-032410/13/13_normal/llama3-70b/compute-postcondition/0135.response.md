The `break` statement causes the program to exit the current loop or conditional statement. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is at least 2, `j` is `i - 2`, if `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` equals 2, otherwise `beauty` equals 1 and the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
