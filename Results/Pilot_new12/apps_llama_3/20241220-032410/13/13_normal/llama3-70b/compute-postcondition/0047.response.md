The code increments the value of `left` by 1. The initial state specifies that `left` is `left + 1` and is less than `right`, and the character at the new `s[left]` is not 'G'. 

After the increment operation, `left` is now `left + 2`, and it is still less than `right` because `right` must be at least `left + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` must be at least `left + 2`, `left` is `left + 2` and is less than `right`, and the character at the new `s[left]` is not 'G'**
