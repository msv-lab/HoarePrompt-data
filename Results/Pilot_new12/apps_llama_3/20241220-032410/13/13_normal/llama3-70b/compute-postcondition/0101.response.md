The `break` statement does not modify any variables, but it exits the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `i`, and `j` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `beauty` if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
