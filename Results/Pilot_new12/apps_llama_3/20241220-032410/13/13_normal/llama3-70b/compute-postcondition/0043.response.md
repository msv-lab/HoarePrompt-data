The value of `left` is incremented by 1, but the previous values of the other variables are preserved. Since `left` is less than `right` initially, after incrementing `left` by 1, `left` is either equal to `right` or still less than `right`. The state of `s[left]` after incrementing can change to either 'G' or 'S' depending on the original string `s`, but it's no longer guaranteed to be 'S'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1 and less than `n`, and `left` is the old value of `left` plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1 and less than `n`, `left` is the old value of `left` plus 1, and `left` is less than or equal to `right`.**
