The function `func` seems to be missing parameters. Based on the provided parameter constraints, the function should accept two parameters: an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. 

Assuming the corrected function is:
```python
def func(n, s):
```
The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer where 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', where 'G' represents a golden trophy and 'S' represents a silver trophy.

However, without the specific output details, the functionality description remains incomplete. If we were to follow the provided format and infer a generic output based on typical operations involving strings and integers, we might describe the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, and returns a value based on the input parameters.** 

To provide a more accurate description, the specific output or return conditions (like those given in the examples with Case_1, Case_2, etc.) would be necessary. Without this information, the exact return value or behavior of the function cannot be determined.
