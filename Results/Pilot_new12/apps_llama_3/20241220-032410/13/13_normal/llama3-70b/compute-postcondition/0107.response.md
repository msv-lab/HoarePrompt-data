To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the provided information and the loop code.

The loop iterates from `i - 1` down to `-1` (since the range function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value), checking each character in the string `s`. If the character is 'G', it increments the `beauty` variable by 1. If the character is 'S', it breaks out of the loop.

From the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

- `n` remains unchanged as it is the length of the string `s` and does not depend on the loop iterations.
- `s` also remains unchanged as it is the input string.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, which does not change during the loop iterations.
- `right` equals `n` and does not change during the loop iterations.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, but its exact value after the loop finishes depends on the values of `curr_beauty` during the iterations, which is not directly provided.
- `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence but its final value is not directly provided.
- `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, but its final value after the loop iterations is not directly provided.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `beauty` if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', indicating a condition that can be met during the iterations.
- `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, indicating the loop iterates over the string considering these conditions.
- `j` starts at `i - 1` and decrements until it reaches `-1` or breaks due to encountering an 'S'.
- `beauty` starts at 1 and increments by 1 for each 'G' encountered in the reverse iteration from `i - 1` onwards until it encounters an 'S' or reaches the start of the string.

Given the loop code, we can infer the final state:

- `n`, `s`, `golden`, and `right` will remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
- `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` depend on conditions and states that are not explicitly provided after all iterations, but they reflect the maximum beauty and current state after considering all possible sequences.
- `i` ends at its initial value after each iteration of the outer loop (not shown in the provided snippet), as it is part of the loop condition.
- `j` will end at `-1` if the loop completes without breaking (i.e., if all characters from `i - 1` to the start are 'G'), or at the index of the first 'S' encountered.
- `beauty` will end at a value that represents the count of consecutive 'G's from `i - 1` towards the start of the string, until it encounters an 'S' or reaches the beginning.

Considering the initial state and the changes during the loop, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, `i` has completed its iterations, `j` is either `-1` or the index of the first 'S' encountered from `i - 1`, and `beauty` represents the count of consecutive 'G's from the last considered position.**
