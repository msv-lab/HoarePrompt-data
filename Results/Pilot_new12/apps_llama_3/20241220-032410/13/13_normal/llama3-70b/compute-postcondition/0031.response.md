To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `left < right and s[left]!= 'G'`.

1. **Condition 1: `left < right`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `right` is greater than `left`, and `left` is the old `left` plus one. This means `left` has been incremented.
   - For the loop to execute again, `left` must still be less than `right`. Given that `left` has been incremented, `right` must be greater than the new `left` value.

2. **Condition 2: `s[left]!= 'G'`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, since the loop body is omitted, we cannot directly infer the value of `s[left]`. However, the loop condition specifically checks that `s[left]` is not 'G'.
   - For the loop to execute again, `s[left]` must not be 'G' after the increment of `left`.

Considering these conditions:

- `n` being an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) does not directly affect the loop condition but defines the length of `s`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. This state does not need adjustment but is crucial for understanding `s[left]`.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`. This state informs about the positions of 'G' in `s` but does not directly influence the loop condition.
- `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` are 0, which does not affect the loop's ability to execute.
- `right` is greater than `left`, and since `left` has been incremented, `right` must remain greater than this new `left` to satisfy `left < right`.
- `left` is the old `left` plus one, meaning it has been incremented. For the loop to run again, `left` must still be less than `right`, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'.

Adjusting the states according to the conditions:

- The string `s` and its length `n` do not need adjustment.
- `golden` provides context but does not need adjustment for the loop to execute.
- `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` are 0, which does not impact the loop's execution.
- `right` must be greater than the new `left` value.
- `left` has been incremented and must be less than `right`.
- `s[left]` must not be 'G' for the loop to execute again.

**State: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` must be greater than the new `left` value, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'**
