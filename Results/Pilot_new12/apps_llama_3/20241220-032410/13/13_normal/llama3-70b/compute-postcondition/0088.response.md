To determine the output state of the loop, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```
for j in range(i + 2, n):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```

From the given output states, we can see that:

* The loop will execute at least once if `n` is at least 3.
* If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` will be incremented by 1.
* If `s[j]` is 'S', then the loop will break.
* The loop will continue until it finds an 'S' or reaches the end of the string.

Now, let's analyze the loop code step by step:

1. The loop starts from `i + 2` and goes up to `n`.
2. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` will be incremented by 1.
3. If `s[j]` is 'S', then the loop will break.

After all the iterations of the loop have finished, the output state will be:

* `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
* `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
* `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
* `right` equals `n`.
* `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`.
* `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence.
* `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string.
* `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0.
* `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`.
* `j` will be equal to the index where the loop last checked or `n` if it checked all the way to the end without finding an 'S'.
* `beauty` will be equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i + 1` to the index where the loop last checked (inclusive), or will remain the same if the loop broke due to an 'S'.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is less than 3), the output state will be the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is equal to the index where the loop last checked or `n` if it checked all the way to the end without finding an 'S', `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i + 1` to the index where the loop last checked (inclusive), or remains the same if the loop broke due to an 'S'.**
