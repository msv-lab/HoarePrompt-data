To determine the new state for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 2, n):`. This means that `j` will take on values starting from `i + 2` up to `n-1` because the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the end value.

Given that `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be such that `i + 2` is less than `n`. Since `i` is already less than `n - 2`, this condition is inherently satisfied.

At the start of the next iteration, `j` needs to be `i + 2` because that's how the `range` function works. However, since we're looking at what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute again, we consider the increment of `i` that allows `j` to take on its next possible value.

Since `j` starts at `i + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 so that `j` can start at the next index. 

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 2` or the next index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found at that position**
