The code `beauty += 1` increments the `beauty` variable by 1. The previous value of `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters to the left of `i` in `s`, plus 1. 

After the increment operation, `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters to the left of `i` in `s`, plus 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found, the current value of `j` is not -1, `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters to the left of `i` in `s`, plus 2, and the character at index `j` in `s` is 'G'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found, the current value of `j` is not -1, `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters to the left of `i` in `s`, plus 2, and the character at index `j` in `s` is 'G'**
