The code increments the `curr_beauty` by 1. The initial values of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `left`, and `right` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is `curr_beauty + 1`, `max_beauty` is 0, `left` is either equal to `right` or points to the first 'G' character from its initial position, `right` remains less than `n`, and the current value of `left` is less than the current value of `right`**
