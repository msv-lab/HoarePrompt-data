To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.

The code snippet is:
```python
golden = [i for i, x in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
```
This line creates a new list called `golden` that contains the indices `i` of the string `s` where the character `x` is equal to 'G'.

Given the initial state, the length of `s` is `n`, and it consists only of 'G' and 'S' characters. The list comprehension iterates over `s`, checking each character. When it encounters a 'G', it adds the index of that 'G' to the `golden` list.

After executing this code, the state of `n` and `s` remains unchanged because the code does not modify these variables. However, a new variable `golden` is introduced, which contains the indices of all 'G' characters in the string `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.**
