Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, and `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters in the specified window plus the initial count of 'G's before `i`, otherwise the state of the variables remains unchanged, `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` reflect values determined outside this loop or before it started, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, and `j` equals `n` after the loop if it executes.***
