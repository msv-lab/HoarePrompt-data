According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 3`, `n` is at least 3, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1, so `j` is `i + 4`. The loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`, which means `i + 4` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `i` can be incremented to satisfy the condition `i + 4 < n`. Therefore, `i` must be less than `n - 3` for the loop to execute one more time, and since `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, it can be incremented by 1 to `i + 1` for the loop to execute again with `j` starting from `i + 3` in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`**
