To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute, we must consider the loop's conditions and the given state before the loop starts. The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 2, n):`, which means the loop will execute if `i + 2` is less than `n`. Given that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `i` is greater than or equal to 0, we need to ensure that `i` is such that `i + 2` is less than `n` for the loop to execute at least once.

Given the conditions and the initial state:
- `n` is between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` with characters 'G' and 'S',
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `right` equals `n`,
- `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found,
- `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations,
- `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string,
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`,
- `i` is greater than or equal to 0,
- `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found,
- `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters to the left of `i` in `s`, plus 1,

For the loop to execute, `i + 2` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the minimum value of `i` that would still allow the loop to execute (considering `n` is at least 2) would be such that `i + 2 < n`. The largest value of `i` that would still allow the loop to execute would be `n - 2`, because `i + 2` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute at least once.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute include ensuring that `n` is at least 2 (which is given), `i` is such that `i + 2 < n`, and the other variables are as defined in the initial state.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found, `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters to the left of `i` in `s`, plus 1**
