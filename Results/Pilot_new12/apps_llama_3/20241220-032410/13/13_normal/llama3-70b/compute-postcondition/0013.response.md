To determine the output state after executing the given code, let's analyze the changes made by the code snippet `left += 1` based on the provided initial state.

1. **`n` remains an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive):** This condition is unchanged by the code snippet.
2. **`s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S':** This condition is also unaffected by the code snippet.
3. **`golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`:** The code snippet does not modify `golden`.
4. **`max_beauty` remains 0:** This value is not changed by the code snippet.
5. **`curr_beauty` remains 0:** The code snippet does not affect `curr_beauty`.
6. **`left` remains 0:** This is the variable that is modified by the code snippet. `left` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `left + 1`, or specifically, it becomes 1.
7. **`right` must be greater than `left`:** Initially, `right` must be at least 1 because `left` is 0. Since `left` is now 1, `right` must still be greater than `left`, so it remains at least 2 or more, depending on its previous value.
8. **The character at index `left` (0) in `s` must be 'S', and since the character at index `right` is 'S':** The character at the new `left` index (1) in `s` is not specified by the initial conditions provided, but we know the character at the original `left` index (0) was 'S'. The condition regarding the character at `right` being 'S' is still valid.

After incrementing `left` by 1, the output state reflects the change in `left` and maintains all other initial conditions that were not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 1, `right` is greater than `left`, and the character at the original `left` index (0) in `s` is 'S', with `right` positioned at a character that is 'S'.**
