The code increments the value of `beauty` by 1. However, the initial state does not mention `beauty`, but it does mention `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty`. Since the code specifically mentions `beauty`, and assuming it's related to either `curr_beauty` or `max_beauty`, let's consider both possibilities:

- If `beauty` is actually `curr_beauty`, then `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1.
- If `beauty` is actually `max_beauty`, the description does not directly support this interpretation because `max_beauty` is described as the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, not as being directly incremented.

Given the information, the safest assumption is that `beauty` refers to `curr_beauty` since `max_beauty` is defined in terms of `curr_beauty` and itself, suggesting a different update mechanism.

Therefore, the value of `curr_beauty` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `curr_beauty` is unknown, so we can only state that `curr_beauty` has been incremented by 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and the new value of `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3**
