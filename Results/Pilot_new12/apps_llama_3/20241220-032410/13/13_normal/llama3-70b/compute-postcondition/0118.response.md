To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 3`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `right` equals `n`.
- `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found.
- `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations.
- `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition.
- `i` has completed its iterations and `i` < `n - 3`.
- `j` equals `i + 3`, if `s[j]` equals 'G', then `beauty` equals `beauty + 1`, otherwise the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 2, n):`, which means `j` starts at `i + 2` and goes up to but does not include `n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the current state of `j` should be the next possible value after `i + 3` because `j` starts from `i + 2` but the current state is reflected with `j` being `i + 3`. 

So, the next value of `j` for the loop to execute again should start from `i + 3 + 1 = i + 4`. However, considering the loop's structure, `j` will naturally increment by 1 at the start of the next iteration, so we focus on what needs to be true for the loop to continue.

For the loop to continue, `n` must still be greater than the new potential value of `j`, which would be `i + 4` after `i + 3`. But since the loop condition is `j` in `range(i + 2, n)`, what's crucial is that `i + 2` (the starting point of the range) plus one more iteration (making it effectively `i + 3` as the minimum for the next iteration's consideration) does not exceed `n`.

Given `i` < `n - 3` and considering the loop statement, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be able to take on the value of `i + 4` without exceeding `n`. Thus, `n` needs to be greater than `i + 4`.

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time consider `j`'s next value and the condition that allows the loop to continue:

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 4`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, `i` < `n - 3`, `j` equals `i + 4`**.
