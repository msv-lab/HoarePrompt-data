To calculate the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to understand how the loop modifies the variables and what conditions must be met for the loop to execute.

The loop is a for loop that iterates over the indices of the string `s` starting from `i + 2` up to `n`. Inside the loop, it checks if the character at the current index `j` is 'G'. If it is, it increments the `beauty` variable by 1. If it's not 'G', it breaks out of the loop.

- `n` remains unchanged as it's the input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` remains unchanged as it's the input string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, and its value doesn't change within this loop.
- `right` equals `n` and doesn't change within this loop.
- `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, but its update is not shown within this loop snippet. Its final value will depend on updates outside this loop or based on `beauty` before this loop started.
- `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, but similar to `max_beauty`, its update is not shown within this loop.
- `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, but its update is not shown within this loop.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, but the exact update rule within this loop isn't provided. It's mentioned to be updated with `beauty - 1` under certain conditions, but the full logic isn't here.
- `i` starts at a value greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2` for the loop to execute at least once. After all iterations, `i` will remain at its initial value since the loop iterates over `j`, not `i`.
- `j` iterates over the range from `i + 2` to `n`. After the loop finishes, `j` will be equal to `n` because that's the last value it takes in the loop before it ends.
- `beauty` starts as the number of consecutive 'G' characters to the left of `i` in `s`, plus 1. After the loop, `beauty` will be the number of consecutive 'G' characters starting from `i + 2` (or after the last 'G' considered before this loop, if any) up to the first 'S' encountered or the end of the string `s`, plus the initial count of consecutive 'G's to the left of `i`. Essentially, it counts consecutive 'G's in a window starting from `i + 2`.

Given the provided output states for the first few iterations and focusing on the loop code:

- If the loop doesn't execute (meaning `i` is not less than `n - 2`, or no 'G' characters are found in the string in the positions that would allow the loop to start), the variables will retain their initial values, except for `j` which won't be defined in this context or will be `-1` if defined elsewhere before the loop, indicating no 'G' characters were found at the positions required for the loop to execute.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` reflect values determined outside this loop or before it started, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on updates not fully shown in this snippet, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` equals `n` after the loop if it executes, and `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters in the specified window plus the initial count of 'G's before `i`. If the loop does not execute due to conditions not being met, the variables' states will be their initial states, with `j` being undefined or `-1` if the loop conditions are not met.**
