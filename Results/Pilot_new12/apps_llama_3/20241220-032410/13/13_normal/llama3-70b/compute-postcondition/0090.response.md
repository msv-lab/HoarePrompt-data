Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `beauty`, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is equal to the index where the loop last checked or `n` if it checked all the way to the end without finding an 'S', and `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i + 1` to the index where the loop last checked (inclusive), or remains the same if the loop broke due to an 'S'; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged***
