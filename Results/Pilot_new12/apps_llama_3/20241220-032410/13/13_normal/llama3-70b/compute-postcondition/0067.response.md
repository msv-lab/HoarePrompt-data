The given code is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the loop or conditional statement it is currently inside. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` must be at least 1, `j` equals `i - 2`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and at index `i + 1` is 'S', if the character at index `j` in `s` is 'G', then `beauty` equals 2, otherwise `beauty` equals 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
