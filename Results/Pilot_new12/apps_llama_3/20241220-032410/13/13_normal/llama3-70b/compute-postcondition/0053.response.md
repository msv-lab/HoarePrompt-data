To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's examine the loop's behavior and its impact on the variables.

The loop iterates over the string `s` from left to right. When it encounters a 'G' character, it increments `curr_beauty`. When it encounters an 'S' character, it checks if `curr_beauty` is greater than `max_beauty` and updates `max_beauty` if necessary. Then, it resets `curr_beauty` to 0 and moves the `left` pointer to the right until it finds a 'G' character or reaches the current `right` position.

After the loop finishes iterating over the entire string, the following conditions will be true:

- `n` remains unchanged as it's the input integer representing the length of the string `s`.
- `s` remains unchanged as it's the input string.
- `golden` remains unchanged as it's the list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, which doesn't get modified within the loop.
- `right` will be equal to `n` because the loop iterates `n` times, incrementing `right` from 0 to `n-1`.
- `max_beauty` will hold the maximum beauty found during the iteration, which is the maximum number of consecutive 'G' characters found without being interrupted by an 'S' character that doesn't immediately follow another 'G' character. If no 'G' characters were found, `max_beauty` remains 0.
- `curr_beauty` will be 0 if the last character in the string is 'S', or it will be 1 if the last character is 'G' and there are no 'S' characters before it that don't immediately follow a 'G' character, indicating an uninterrupted 'G' sequence ending at the last position. However, since `curr_beauty` is reset whenever an 'S' is encountered and the loop ends, its final value is primarily determined by the last character and the loop's behavior upon encountering 'S'.
- `left` will be at the position of the last 'G' character in the string if such a character exists and is not immediately followed by an 'S' that doesn't also follow a 'G', or it will be at the end of the string if the string ends with 'S' characters.

Considering the condition for `max_beauty` to be updated and the impact of `left` and `right` pointers, the output state reflects the maximum beauty found in sequences of 'G' characters that are not interrupted by 'S' characters unless those 'S' characters are immediately preceded by a 'G' character, which does not reset the beauty counter in the final iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G' characters without interruption by an 'S' that doesn't follow a 'G', `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, and `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string.**
