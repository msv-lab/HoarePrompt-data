To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the patterns observed from the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```

Given the initial conditions and the changes observed in the output states after each iteration, we can deduce the following:

1. The loop iterates backwards from `i - 1` down to `0`.
2. If it encounters a 'G' at any index `j`, it increments `beauty` by 1.
3. If it encounters an 'S', it breaks out of the loop.
4. The loop will not execute at all if `i` is 0 because the range will be empty (`range(0 - 1, -1, -1)` is `range(-1, -1, -1)`, which is empty).

Based on these observations and considering all possible scenarios for the string `s`, the values of `i`, and the conditions under which the loop breaks or completes, we can infer the final output state.

- `n` remains an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `right` equals `n`.
- `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0.
- The value of `i` must be at least 0 (considering the case where `i` is 0 and the loop does not execute).
- The final value of `j` will be `-1` if the loop completes without breaking (i.e., all characters from `i - 1` down to `0` are 'G'), or it will be the index of the first 'S' encountered when iterating backwards from `i - 1`.
- `beauty` will be incremented for each 'G' found in the string from index `i - 1` backwards until an 'S' is encountered or the beginning of the string is reached.

Considering these points, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` is at least 0, `j` is the index where the loop last checked or -1 if it checked all the way to the start without finding an 'S', `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i - 1` backwards plus 1 (for the 'G' at index `i`), or remains 1 if `i` is 0 or if an 'S' is immediately to the left of `i`.**
