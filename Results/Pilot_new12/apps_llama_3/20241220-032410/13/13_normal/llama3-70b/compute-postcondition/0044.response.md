To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions of the `while` loop: `left < right` and `s[left]!= 'G'`.

1. **Condition `left < right`:** At the end of the previous iteration, `left` is the old value of `left` plus 1, and `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1 and less than `n`. Since both `left` and `right` are incremented, the difference between them remains the same as in the previous iteration. However, to ensure the loop can execute again, we must make sure that `left` is still less than `right`. Given `left` is less than or equal to `right` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to run again, `left` must be less than `right`, not equal. This condition is naturally satisfied because when `left` equals `right`, the loop would not execute due to the first condition (`left < right`), so it's necessary that `right` must be greater than `left` after the adjustment.

2. **Condition `s[left]!= 'G':`** At the end of the previous iteration, since `left` has been incremented, for the loop to execute again, the character at the new `left` index must not be 'G'. There is no direct information provided about the nature of `s` at the new `left` index, but we know `s` consists of characters 'G' and 'S'. To ensure the loop can proceed, we need to assume or adjust so that the character at the new `left` index is 'S', not 'G'.

Considering these conditions, the necessary adjustments are:

- `left` must be less than `right`.
- The character at the new `left` index in `s` must not be 'G', implying it should be 'S'.

The other states (`n`, `s` being of length `n`, `golden` being the list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0) do not directly influence the loop's condition to execute one more time.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is less than `n`, `left` is less than `right`, and the character at the new `left` index in `s` is 'S'**
