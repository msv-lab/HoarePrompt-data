Postcondition: ***`left` is either equal to `right` or points to the first 'G' character in the string `s`, the original value of `left` (0) is a 'S' character in `s`, `right` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to the original value of `left`. If `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is `curr_beauty + 1`. If `left` is not less than `right`, the state of the program remains unchanged with respect to `curr_beauty`.***
