Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1, `right` is less than `n`, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `right`. If `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is the old value of `curr_beauty` plus 1. Otherwise, if `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is 1 and `max_beauty` is 0; if `left` is not less than `right` or `s[left]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` retain their initial values.**
