According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is incremented by 1 and `i` < `n - 1` for the loop to execute again, `j` is either the index of the first 'S' encountered after `i + 2` or equals `n` if no 'S' is found, and `beauty` equals 1. So for the loop to be executed, `i` must be greater than 0 and `j` is at least `i - 1`. 
State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is at least `i - 1`, and `beauty` equals 1**
