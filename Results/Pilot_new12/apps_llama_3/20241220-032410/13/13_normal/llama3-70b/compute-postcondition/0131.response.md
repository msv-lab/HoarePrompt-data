The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it stops the execution of the innermost loop. 
The Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is at least `i - 1`, `beauty` equals 1, the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S', and we break out of the most internal loop.
