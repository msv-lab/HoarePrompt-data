To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have executed, we need to consider how the loop condition and the operations within the loop affect the variables.

The loop condition is `left < right and s[left]!= 'G'`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `left` is less than `right` and the character at the `left` index in string `s` is not 'G'.

Within the loop, the operation `left += 1` increments the `left` index. This means that `left` will keep moving to the right in the string `s` until it either reaches or exceeds `right` or finds a 'G' character.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior, here's how we can deduce the output state:

- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `s` also remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, which does not change during the loop execution since `s` does not change.
- `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` are initially 0, but their values are not affected by the loop since there are no operations that modify these variables within the loop provided.
- `right` is less than `n`, but its exact value after the loop is not directly determined by the loop's operation. However, since `left` is incremented until it is no longer less than `right` or until it finds a 'G', `right`'s value relative to `left` and the condition will determine the termination of the loop.
- `left` will be incremented until the loop condition is no longer met, meaning either `left` is not less than `right` or `s[left]` is 'G'.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop have executed, the key change is in the `left` variable. The loop will terminate when `left` is either equal to or greater than `right`, or when `s[left]` equals 'G'. 

Since `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` do not change within the loop, and given the loop's focus on incrementing `left` until it meets the 'G' character or `right`, the output state concerning these variables remains static.

The output state, therefore, reflects the initial conditions with the primary change being in the `left` index due to the loop's operation.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `left` is either equal to `right` or points to the first 'G' character from its initial position, and `right` remains less than `n`.**
