To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given code and the patterns observed in the output states after a few iterations.

The loop iterates over the string `s` from index 0 to `n-2` (since the loop condition is `range(n-1)`). Inside the loop, it checks if the current character `s[i]` is 'G' and the next character `s[i+1]` is 'S'. If this condition is met, it calculates a beauty score by counting the number of consecutive 'G's to the left of `i` and to the right of `i+1`, and then updates `max_beauty_one_swap` with the maximum of its current value and the calculated beauty score.

From the output states after a few iterations, we can observe the following patterns:

- `n` remains the same as it is the length of the string `s`.
- `s` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `golden` remains the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `right` remains equal to `n` as it is not modified within the loop.
- `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` are not modified within this loop, so their values depend on operations outside this loop or before it started.
- `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, but since it is not updated within this loop, its final state after the loop depends on its initial state or updates outside this loop.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the beauty score calculated whenever the condition `s[i] == 'G'` and `s[i+1] == 'S'` is met.
- `i` will have iterated over all indices from 0 to `n-2` by the end of the loop.
- `j` is used within the inner loops to count consecutive 'G's and will have iterated over the relevant indices by the end of the loop.
- `beauty` is a temporary variable used to calculate the beauty score for each pair of 'G' followed by 'S' and is not retained after each iteration.

Given these observations, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` reflect values determined outside this loop or before it started, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string based on its initial state or updates outside this loop, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty score found for all 'G' 'S' pairs in `s`, `i` has iterated over all indices from 0 to `n-2`, and `j` and `beauty` are temporary variables whose final states are not significant after the loop completes.**
