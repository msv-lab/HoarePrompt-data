The code increments the value of `left` by 1. The initial state specifies that `left` is less than `right` and the character at index `left` in `s` is not 'G'. After incrementing `left`, it is still less than `right` because `right` is greater than `left + 1`. However, the character at the new index `left` in `s` may or may not be 'G', but this information is not provided. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is greater than `left + 1`, and `left` is now `left + 1`, which means the new `left` is the old `left` plus one.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is greater than `left`, and `left` is the old `left` plus one**
