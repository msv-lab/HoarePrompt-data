Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`. If `s[j]` equals 'G', then `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. If `s[j]` does not equal 'G', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, and `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence.***
