The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `beauty` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty` before the update, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 3` or the next index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found at that position, `beauty` is one more than its previous value.
