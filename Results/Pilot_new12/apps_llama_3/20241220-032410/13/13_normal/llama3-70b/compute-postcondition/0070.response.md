The code increments the `beauty` variable by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the current value of `beauty`. Since `beauty` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its exact value after the increment operation. Nevertheless, we can express its new value as `beauty + 1`. 

Given that `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, and assuming `beauty` is related to `curr_beauty`, the value of `curr_beauty` would also increase by 1 if `beauty` and `curr_beauty` are equivalent or directly related. However, without explicit information linking `beauty` and `curr_beauty`, we cannot be certain of this relationship.

The states of the other variables are not affected by the increment operation. 

Therefore, considering the provided information and focusing on `beauty` (assuming it's directly related to or is `curr_beauty`), the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence and is increased by 1, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` must be at least 1, `j` equals `i - 3`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and at index `i + 1` is 'S', and `beauty` (or `curr_beauty`) is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty + 1`, `curr_beauty` is increased by 1, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` must be at least 1, `j` equals `i - 3`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and at index `i + 1` is 'S', and `beauty` (or `curr_beauty`) is `beauty + 1`.**
