According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right` and the character at `s[left]`. If `left` is less than `right` and the character at `s[left]` is not 'G', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `left` is `left + 1` and is less than `right`, and there is no information about the character at `s[left]`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `left` must still be less than `right` after the increment, so `right` must be at least `left + 2` (because `left` is `left + 1`), and the character at the new `s[left]` must not be 'G'. 

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` must be at least `left + 2`, `left` is `left + 1` and is less than `right`, and the character at the new `s[left]` is not 'G'**
