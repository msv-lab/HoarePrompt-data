The code prints the maximum value between `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. The states of the variables are not changed by the print statement, but the value that is printed is the maximum of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` reflect values determined outside this loop or before it started, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string based on its initial state or updates outside this loop, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty score found for all 'G' 'S' pairs in `s`, `i` has iterated over all indices from 0 to `n-2`, `j` and `beauty` are temporary variables whose final states are not significant after the loop completes, and the maximum of `max_beauty` and `max_beauty_one_swap` has been returned and printed.**
