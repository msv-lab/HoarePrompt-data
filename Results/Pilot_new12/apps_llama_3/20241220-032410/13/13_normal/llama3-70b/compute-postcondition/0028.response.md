The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was less than `right` and not in `golden`. The new value of `left` is still less than `n` because the initial value of `left` was less than `right` and `right` is less than `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is less than `n`, and `left` is `left + 1`, `left` is still less than `right` and not in `golden`**
