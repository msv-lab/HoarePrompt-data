To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state is defined as follows: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1, and `right` is less than `n`. The given code snippet is `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)`.

Given the code `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)`, we can see that it updates the value of `max_beauty` by taking the maximum value between the current `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`. 

However, we don't have information about `curr_beauty` in the initial state, so we can't determine its exact value. But we can conclude that `max_beauty` will be either its old value (0) if `curr_beauty` is less than or equal to 0, or it will be equal to `curr_beauty` if `curr_beauty` is greater than 0.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`, and `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1 and is less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty`, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1 and is less than `n`**
