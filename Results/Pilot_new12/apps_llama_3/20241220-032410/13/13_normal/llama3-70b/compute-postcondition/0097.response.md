The `break` statement is used to exit the loop prematurely. In this case, it does not change any variable values but terminates the loop it is directly inside. 
The output state will include all the information from the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed, with the understanding that the loop has been terminated.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `beauty` if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is initialized to `i - 1` for the loop to start, `beauty` is 1, the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'S', and we break out of the most internal loop.**
