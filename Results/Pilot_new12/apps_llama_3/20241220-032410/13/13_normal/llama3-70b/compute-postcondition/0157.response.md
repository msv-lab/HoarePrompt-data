The given Python code snippet updates the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `beauty`. 

The value of `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to `max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)`, where `max_beauty_one_swap` and `beauty` are values determined before this line of code or outside this loop. 

Other variables like `n`, `s`, `golden`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `i`, `j`, and `beauty` are not affected by this line of code, so they retain their previous values. 

`n` remains an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` retain their values determined outside this loop or before it started, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `i` remains greater than or equal to 0, `j` equals `n` after the loop if it executes, and `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters in the specified window plus the initial count of 'G's before `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` reflect values determined outside this loop or before it started, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` equals `n` after the loop if it executes, and `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters in the specified window plus the initial count of 'G's before `i`.**
