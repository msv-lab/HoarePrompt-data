According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 2` or the next index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found at that position. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be incremented by 1 to point to the next position in the string, so `j` becomes `i + 3` if the next 'G' character was not found, or the next index of the last 'G' character found. 
State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 3` or the next index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found at that position**
