The code updates the `max_beauty` variable to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`. This means that `max_beauty` will now hold the maximum number of consecutive 'G' characters without interruption by an 'S' that doesn't follow a 'G' encountered so far.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, `n` remains an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `curr_beauty` still reflects the state of the last character and sequence, and `left` still points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, and `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string.**
