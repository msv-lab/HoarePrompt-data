The given code is a single statement: `break`. This statement is used to exit a loop or a switch statement. In this case, since there's no loop or switch statement provided in the code snippet, we'll consider its effect in a general context.

The `break` statement doesn't modify any variables; it only affects the flow of control by terminating the loop or switch statement it's enclosed within. Given the initial state and the lack of specific details about the loop or conditional structure this `break` is part of, we can conclude that the primary effect is to exit the most internal loop or conditional block this statement is directly inside of.

Considering the variables and their states provided in the initial condition:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `right` equals `n`
- `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found
- `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations
- `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`
- `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 1`
- `j` is `i + 3` or the next index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found at that position

After executing the `break` statement, the values of all variables remain unchanged because `break` does not alter variable values; it only changes the control flow.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i + 3` or the next index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found at that position, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
