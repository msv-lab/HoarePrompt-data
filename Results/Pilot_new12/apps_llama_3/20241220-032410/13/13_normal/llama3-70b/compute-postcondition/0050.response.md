The value of `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `curr_beauty` was 0, so the new value of `curr_beauty` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 1, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is less than `n`, `left` is less than `right`, and either initially `left` was not less than `right` or `s[left]` is 'G', but currently `left` is less than `right`.
