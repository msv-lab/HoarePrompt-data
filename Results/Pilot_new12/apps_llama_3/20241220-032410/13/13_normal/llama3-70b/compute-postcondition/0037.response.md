Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1, `right` is less than `n`, and if `s[right]` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is the old value of `curr_beauty` + 1; otherwise, if `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is `curr_beauty + 1`, otherwise `curr_beauty` remains unchanged, and `left` is either equal to `right` or points to the first 'G' character from its initial position.**
