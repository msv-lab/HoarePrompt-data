The code `beauty = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `beauty`. The initial state has several variables with specific properties, but none of them are directly affected by this assignment except that `curr_beauty` was described in relation to reflecting the state of the last character and sequence, and now a `beauty` variable is introduced. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S',
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `right` equals `n`,
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`,
- `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence,
- `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string,
- `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0,
- `i` is 0,
- The current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and at index `i + 1` is 'S'.

The introduction of `beauty` with a value of 1 does not directly alter the values or states of the other variables as described in the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` is 0, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and at index `i + 1` is 'S', and `beauty` equals 1.**
