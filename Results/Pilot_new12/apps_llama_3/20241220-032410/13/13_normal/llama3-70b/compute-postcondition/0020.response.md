The code increments `curr_beauty` by 1. The values of `left` and `right` and their relationship with each other and with the string `s` are not affected by this code. Therefore, `left` is still either equal to `right` or points to the first 'G' character in the string `s`, the original value of `left` (0) is a 'S' character in `s`, `right` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to the original value of `left`. The current value of `left` is less than the current value of `right`. `curr_beauty` is now `curr_beauty + 1`.

Output State: **`left` is either equal to `right` or points to the first 'G' character in the string `s`, the original value of `left` (0) is a 'S' character in `s`, `right` remains unchanged and is greater than or equal to the original value of `left`, `left` is less than `right`, and `curr_beauty` is `curr_beauty + 1`.**
