The given code increments the value of `beauty` by 1. The previous value of `beauty` is not explicitly stated, but we can express the new value of `beauty` as `beauty + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `n` is still an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is still a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` is still equal to `n`, `max_beauty` is still the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` still reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` still points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` still equals `beauty` if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `i` is still at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is still `i - 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `beauty` if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i - 3`, `beauty` equals `beauty + 1`**
