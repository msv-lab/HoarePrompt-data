The code increments the `left` variable by 1. The previous value of `left` was 1, so the new value of `left` is 2. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Since `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', and `left` is now 2, `s[left]` is the character at index 2 in `s`. However, we don't have enough information to determine the value of `s[left]`. 

The states of `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, and `right` are not affected. Also, `left` is still less than `right`, and `right` is still greater than `left`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 2 and less than `right`, `right` is greater than `left`, the character at the original `left` index (0) in `s` is 'S', with `right` positioned at a character that is 'S'**
