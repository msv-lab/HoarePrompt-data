To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we must consider what happens when the loop completes its execution. The loop is designed to iterate over the string `s` from index `i + 2` to the end of the string `n`, incrementing a beauty counter `beauty` for each 'G' encountered and breaking the loop upon encountering an 'S'.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`, starting from `i + 2`. This implies that for the loop to execute at all, `n` must be greater than `i + 2`.

2. **Beauty Counter (`beauty`)**: This variable increments by 1 for each 'G' character encountered in the string `s` starting from index `i + 2`. The loop breaks as soon as it encounters an 'S'. Therefore, after all iterations, `beauty` will represent the count of consecutive 'G's in the string `s` starting from the index `i + 2` until the first 'S' is encountered or the end of the string is reached.

3. **Index `j`**: After the loop completes, `j` will be the index of the first 'S' encountered after `i + 2` if such an 'S' exists, or it will be equal to `n` if no 'S' is found after `i + 2`.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `n`, `s`, `golden`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, and `i` are not directly modified within this specific loop. Their values will remain as they were before the loop started, except for any changes that might occur in the broader context of the program not shown here.

Considering these points, we can determine the output state of the loop. If the loop executes, `beauty` will count the consecutive 'G's from index `i + 2` until an 'S' is encountered or the end of the string is reached. If the loop does not execute (because `n` is not greater than `i + 2`), `beauty` will retain its value from before the loop, which is not specified in the given context but can be considered as not having changed due to this loop.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, `i` has completed its iterations and `i` < `n - 2` for the loop to have executed, `j` is either the index of the first 'S' encountered after `i + 2` or equals `n` if no 'S' is found, and `beauty` equals the count of consecutive 'G's from index `i + 2` until the first 'S' is encountered or the end of the string is reached.**
