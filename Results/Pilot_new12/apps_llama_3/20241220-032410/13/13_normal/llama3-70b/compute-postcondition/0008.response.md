The code increments the value of `curr_beauty` by 1. The initial value of `curr_beauty` is 0, so after the increment operation, `curr_beauty` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 1, `left` is 0, and `right` is an index such that the character at this index in `s` is 'G'**
