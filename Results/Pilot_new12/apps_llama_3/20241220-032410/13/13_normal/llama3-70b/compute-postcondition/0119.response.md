The code increments the `beauty` variable by 1. However, the initial state does not mention the `beauty` variable. It talks about `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` instead. Assuming that the code is referring to one of these beauty variables, let's analyze the possible outcomes.


If we assume that the code is incrementing `curr_beauty` (since it is not clear which one is being incremented):
`curr_beauty` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `curr_beauty + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.


If we assume that the code is incrementing `max_beauty` (since it is not clear which one is being incremented):
`max_beauty` is incremented by 1, so its new value is `max_beauty + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.


Since the initial state does not explicitly mention a `beauty` variable and does mention `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty`, for both cases:
The initial state remains valid for `n`, `s`, `golden`, `right`, `left`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `i`, and `j`, with the added information about `curr_beauty` or `max_beauty`. 
Given that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 4`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, `i` < `n - 3`, `j` equals `i + 4`. 

We should assume `curr_beauty` is being incremented here to avoid modifying `max_beauty` as no max beauty has been reported as found here so we will stick with `curr_beauty`.


Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 4`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations and is now `curr_beauty + 1`, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, `i` < `n - 3`, `j` equals `i + 4`**
