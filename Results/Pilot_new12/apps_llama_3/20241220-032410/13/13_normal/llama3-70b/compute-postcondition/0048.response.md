To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze the loop's condition and the changes it applies to the variables.

The loop's condition is `left < right and s[left]!= 'G'`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `left` is less than `right` and the character at the `left` index in string `s` is not 'G'.

1. **Termination Condition**: The loop will terminate when either `left` is no longer less than `right` or when it encounters a 'G' at the `left` index in `s`.

2. **Changes to Variables**:
   - `left` is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it either reaches or surpasses `right` or encounters a 'G' in `s`.
   - `right`, `n`, `s`, `golden`, `curr_beauty`, and `max_beauty` do not change within the loop. Their values remain constant throughout the loop's execution.

Given the information from the output states after executing the loop a few times, we can observe:

- The condition for the loop to execute at least once requires `left` to be less than `right` initially.
- For the loop to execute multiple times, it needs the character at the current `left` index to not be 'G', and `left` must be less than `right`.

Considering the termination conditions and the changes (or lack thereof) to the variables, we can deduce the final output state:

- `n`, `s`, `golden`, `curr_beauty`, and `max_beauty` will retain their initial values because they are not modified within the loop.
- `right` will also remain unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `left` will either reach or surpass `right` or will stop at an index where `s[left]` is 'G', whichever condition is met first.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is less than `n`, and either `left` is not less than `right` or `s[left]` is 'G', with `left` being the index where the loop terminated.**
