The code increments the value of `left` by 1. Given the initial state, `left` has already been incremented once to satisfy the conditions for the loop to potentially execute again. 

The impact of `left += 1` is that `left` increases by 1 from its current value. The previous values of the other variables do not change. `n` remains an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` and `max_beauty` are still 0, and `right` must continue to be greater than the new `left` value for the loop to potentially execute. The condition that `s[left]` must not be 'G' still applies after the increment.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `left` is incremented by 1 from its previous value, `right` must be greater than the new `left` value, and `s[left]` must not be 'G'**
