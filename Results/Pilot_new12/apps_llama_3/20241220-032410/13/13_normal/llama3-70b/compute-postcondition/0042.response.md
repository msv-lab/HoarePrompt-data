To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement, which are `left < right` and `s[left]!= 'G'`.

Given state: 
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `curr_beauty` is 0
- `max_beauty` is 0
- `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1
- `right` is less than `n`
- `n` must be greater than the new value of `right`

The condition `left < right` can be satisfied if `left` is less than the current value of `right`, which is already guaranteed since `right` is less than `n` and has been incremented. However, we need to ensure that `left` is actually less than `right` and that `s[left]` is not 'G' for the loop to execute at least once.

The provided information does not specify the initial or current value of `left`, so for the loop to execute, we need to adjust our understanding of the state to ensure `left` is indeed less than `right` and that the character at `s[left]` is 'S' (since `s[left]!= 'G'` is required).

Therefore, the adjusted states for the variables are:
- `n` remains an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `curr_beauty` remains 0
- `max_beauty` remains 0
- `right` remains the old value of `right` plus 1 and less than `n`
- The state must include that `left` is less than `right`
- The state must include that `s[left]` is 'S'

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the old value of `right` plus 1 and less than `n`, `left` is less than `right`, and `s[left]` is 'S'**
