The input consists of an integer `n` (2 <= `n` <= 10^5) and a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. The code `n = int(input())` assigns the input integer to the variable `n`. The string of length `n` is not used in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' exists but is not assigned to any variable**
