Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is at least `i - 1`, if `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` equals 2, otherwise `beauty` equals 1 and the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S', at which point we break out of the most internal loop.**
