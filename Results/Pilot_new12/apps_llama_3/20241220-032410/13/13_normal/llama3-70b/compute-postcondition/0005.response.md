The code introduces a new variable `left` and assigns it the value `0`. This does not affect the values of the existing variables `n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, and `curr_beauty`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `left` is 0**
