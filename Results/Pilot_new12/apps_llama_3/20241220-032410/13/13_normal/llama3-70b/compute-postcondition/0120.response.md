The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. The state of `n` as an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 4`, `s` as a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` as a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflecting the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflecting the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` pointing to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` determined based on the swap condition, `i` < `n - 3`, and `j` equals `i + 4` are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 4`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, `i` < `n - 3`, `j` equals `i + 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 4`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, `i` < `n - 3`, `j` equals `i + 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
