The code snippet is a break statement. The `break` statement in Python is used to terminate the loop or statement in which it is contained. When the `break` statement is encountered, the loop or statement is immediately terminated, and control passes to the statement that follows the loop or statement.

In this case, since there are no changes to any variables, the output state will remain the same as the initial state with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
