To solve this, let's consider the impact of the code on the variables and their initial states.

1. `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive). This value does not change.
2. `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. This value does not change.
3. `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`. This value does not change.
4. `max_beauty` is initially 0. It is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `curr_beauty`.
5. `curr_beauty` is initially 0. Its value does not change in this snippet.
6. `left` is 0. Its value does not change.
7. `right` is 0. Its value does not change.
8. The character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S'. This condition does not change.

Given that `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` are initially 0, `max_beauty` will remain 0 after the operation because the maximum of 0 and 0 is 0.

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S',
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `max_beauty` is 0,
- `curr_beauty` is 0,
- `left` is 0,
- `right` is 0, and
- the character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and the character at index `right` in string `s` is 'S'**
