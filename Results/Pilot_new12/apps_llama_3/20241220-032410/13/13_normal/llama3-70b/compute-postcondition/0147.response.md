Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found. If `s[j]` is 'G', then `j` is not -1, and `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters to the left of `i` in `s`, plus 2. If `s[j]` is not 'G' (or `j` is `-1` and no 'G' characters were found), then `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters to the left of `i` in `s`, plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop.***
