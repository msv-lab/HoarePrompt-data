The code increments the value of `beauty` by 1. The initial value of `beauty` is either 1 or 2, depending on the character at index `j` in `s`. 

So, if the character at index `j` in `s` is 'G', then the initial `beauty` equals 2 and after the increment, it becomes 3. Otherwise, `beauty` equals 1 and after the increment, it becomes 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` must be at least 1, `j` equals `i - 2`, the current value of `s` at index `i` is 'G' and at index `i + 1` is 'S', if the character at index `j` in `s` is 'G', then `beauty` equals 3, otherwise `beauty` equals 2.
