Postcondition: **`n` is at least 3, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 2`, `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i - 1` backwards plus 1 (for the 'G' at index `i`), or remains 1 if `i` is 0 or if an 'S' is immediately to the left of `i`. The current value of `s` at index `j` is 'G'.**
