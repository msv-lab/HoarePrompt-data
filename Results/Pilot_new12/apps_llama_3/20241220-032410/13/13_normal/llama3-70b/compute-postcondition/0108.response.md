To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement and the provided program state before the loop starts.


Given loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i + 2, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

The loop execution depends on the value of `i` and `n`. For the loop to execute, `i + 2` must be less than `n`. Since `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `i` has completed its iterations, we need to ensure that `i` is such that `i + 2` is less than `n` for the loop to start.


Program state before the loop starts:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `right` equals `n`
- `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found
- `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations
- `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition
- `i` has completed its iterations
- `j` is either `-1` or the index of the first 'S' encountered from `i - 1`
- `beauty` represents the count of consecutive 'G's from the last considered position


Adjusting the states for the loop to execute:
- For the loop to execute at least once, `i + 2` must be less than `n`. This implies that `i` should be less than `n - 2` for the loop to have at least one iteration.
- Since `i` has completed its iterations and `j` is either `-1` or the index of the first 'S' encountered from `i - 1`, we should ensure that `i` is in a state that allows `j` to start from `i + 2`.
- Given that `n` is between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), and considering the loop condition, we should adjust the state to reflect that `n` is greater than `i + 2`, ensuring the loop can execute.


State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 2`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, `i` has completed its iterations and `i` < `n - 2`, `j` is about to be initialized to `i + 2`, `beauty` represents the count of consecutive 'G's from the last considered position**
