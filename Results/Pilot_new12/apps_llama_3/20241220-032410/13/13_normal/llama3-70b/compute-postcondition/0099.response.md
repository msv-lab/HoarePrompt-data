To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions that allow the loop to execute again. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1)`, which means it will iterate over the range from `i - 1` down to `0` (since the stop value `-1` is exclusive).

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `right` equals `n`.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`.
- `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence.
- `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `beauty` if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S'.
- `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`.
- `j` is initialized to `i - 1` for the loop to start.
- If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is 2, otherwise, `beauty` is 1.
- If `s[j]` is 'S', we break out of the most internal loop.

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be greater than `-1` since the loop iterates from `i - 1` down to but not including `-1`. Given `j` starts at `i - 1`, for the loop to continue, `j` needs to be decremented, meaning we are looking at the next index in the reverse iteration.

Thus, when adjusting the state for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n`, `s`, `golden`, `right`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, and `max_beauty_one_swap` remain unchanged as their values do not affect the loop's iteration condition directly.
- `i` remains the same because the loop variable is `j`, and `i`'s value does not change within this loop.
- `j` needs to be decremented by 1 from its current value of `i - 1` to continue the loop, thus `j` becomes `i - 2`.
- The condition for `s[j]` being 'G' or 'S' and the associated `beauty` value will be re-evaluated based on the new `j`.

State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence, `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `beauty` if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `i` is at least 1 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i - 2`.**
