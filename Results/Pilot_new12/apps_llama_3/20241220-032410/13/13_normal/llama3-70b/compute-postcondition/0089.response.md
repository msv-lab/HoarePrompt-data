To determine the output state, we analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The code snippet is: `max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)`

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S',
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `right` equals `n`,
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`,
- `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence,
- `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string,
- `max_beauty_one_swap` equals 0,
- `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`,
- `j` is equal to the index where the loop last checked or `n` if it checked all the way to the end without finding an 'S',
- `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i + 1` to the index where the loop last checked (inclusive), or remains the same if the loop broke due to an 'S'.

The impact of the code on the program is that it updates the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`. Since `max_beauty_one_swap` initially equals 0, it will become equal to `beauty` because `beauty` is a non-negative value (as it represents the count of consecutive 'G's).

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state is:
- `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S',
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `right` equals `n`,
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`,
- `curr_beauty` reflects the state of the last character and sequence,
- `left` points to the last 'G' character or is at the end of the string,
- `max_beauty_one_swap` equals `beauty`,
- `i` is at least 0 and less than `n - 2`,
- `j` is equal to the index where the loop last checked or `n` if it checked all the way to the end without finding an 'S',
- `beauty` is equal to the number of consecutive 'G's from index `i + 1` to the index where the loop last checked (inclusive), or remains the same if the loop broke due to an 'S'.
