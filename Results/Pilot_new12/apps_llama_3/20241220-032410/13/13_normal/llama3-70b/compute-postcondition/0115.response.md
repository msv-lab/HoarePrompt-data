The code increments the `beauty` variable by 1. The initial state of `beauty` is not provided, but we can still express the output state in terms of the initial state. 
Given that `n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 3`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, `i` has completed its iterations and `i` < `n - 3`, `j` equals `i + 3`. 
The value of `beauty` is increased by 1, so `beauty` becomes `beauty + 1`. 
Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: 
`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 3`, 
`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', 
`golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, 
`right` equals `n`, 
`max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, 
`curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, 
`left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, 
`max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, 
`i` has completed its iterations and `i` < `n - 3`, 
`j` equals `i + 3`, 
`beauty` equals `beauty + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and `n` > `i + 3`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is determined based on the swap condition, `i` has completed its iterations and `i` < `n - 3`, `j` equals `i + 3`, `beauty` equals `beauty + 1`**
