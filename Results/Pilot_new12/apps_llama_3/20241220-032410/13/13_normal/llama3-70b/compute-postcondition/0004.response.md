The code introduces a new variable `curr_beauty` and assigns it the value 0. The initial state has `n` as an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` as a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` as a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, and `max_beauty` as 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `curr_beauty` is 0**
