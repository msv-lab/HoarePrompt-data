To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
    if s[j] == 'G':
        beauty += 1
    else:
        break
```
From the loop code, we can see that the loop iterates from `i - 1` to `-1` in reverse order. For each iteration, it checks if the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G'. If it is, it increments the `beauty` variable by 1. If it encounters a character that is not 'G', it breaks out of the loop.

From the output states for the first few iterations, we can see that:

* After 1 iteration, `beauty` equals 2 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise it equals 1 and the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S'.
* After 2 iterations, `beauty` equals 3 if `s[j]` is 'G', otherwise it equals 2 if the character at index `j` in `s` is not 'S' and we don't break out of the loop, or it equals 1 if we break out of the loop and the character at index `j` in `s` is 'S'.
* After 3 iterations, `beauty` is increased by 1 if `s[j]` equals 'G', otherwise the loop or if statement is terminated.

From this pattern, we can infer that the `beauty` variable will keep incrementing by 1 as long as the characters at the previous indices are 'G'. As soon as it encounters a character that is not 'G', it will break out of the loop.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, the `beauty` variable will be equal to the number of consecutive 'G' characters that are to the left of the current index `i` in the string `s`, plus 1 (because `beauty` is initialized to 1 before the loop starts).

The other variables will retain their original values or the values they had before the loop started, except for `j` which will be the index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S', `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty` reflects the maximum beauty found, `curr_beauty` reflects the final state of beauty after iterations, `left` points to the last considered 'G' character or the end of the string, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`, `i` is greater than or equal to 0, `j` is the index of the last 'G' character found or `-1` if no 'G' characters were found, and `beauty` equals the number of consecutive 'G' characters to the left of `i` in `s`, plus 1**
