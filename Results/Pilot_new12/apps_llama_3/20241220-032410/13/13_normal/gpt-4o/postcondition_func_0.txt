This function calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of 'G's in a given string `trophies`, considering sequences separated by a single 'S' character, and returns the minimum value between this calculated length plus one and the total length of the string `n`. The function handles edge cases where `trophies` contains no 'G's (returning 0), a single sequence of 'G's (returning the length of this sequence), or multiple sequences of 'G's (returning the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G's plus one and `n`). The function takes two parameters, `n` (the length of the string `trophies`) and `trophies` (the string itself), and returns an integer value based on the sequence of 'G's in `trophies`. The function does not modify the input variables `n` and `trophies`, and its return value is determined by the arrangement of 'G's and 'S's in `trophies`.
