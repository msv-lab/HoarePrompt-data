Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. In the problem description, it is mentioned that Vova can swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible. However, in the given program, it only checks for the case where two segments of golden trophies are separated by a single silver trophy.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when there are two or more silver trophies separating two segments of golden trophies. For example, if the input is "GGGSSGGG", the program should be able to swap two trophies to get the sequence "GGGSGGGSG", but the program does not handle this case.

The program only considers the case where two segments of golden trophies are separated by a single silver trophy, and it does not handle the general case where two trophies can be swapped to maximize the length of the subsegment of golden trophies. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible pairs of swaps and check if the resulting arrangement has a longer subsegment of golden trophies. 

Here's a possible correct solution:

```python
def func_1(n, trophies):
    def max_golden_subsegment(trophies):
        max_length = 0
        current_length = 0
        for trophy in trophies:
            if trophy == 'G':
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 0
        return max_length

    max_length = max_golden_subsegment(trophies)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            swapped_trophies = list(trophies)
            swapped_trophies[i], swapped_trophies[j] = swapped_trophies[j], swapped_trophies[i]
            max_length = max(max_length, max_golden_subsegment(swapped_trophies))
    return max_length
```

This solution checks all possible pairs of swaps and updates the maximum length of the subsegment of golden trophies if a longer subsegment is found.
