You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not handle all the cases as described in the problem statement. In the problem description, it is mentioned that Vova can swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible. However, in the given program, it only checks for the case where two segments of golden trophies are separated by a single silver trophy.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when there are two or more silver trophies separating two segments of golden trophies. For example, if the input is "GGGSSGGG", the program should be able to swap two trophies to get the sequence "GGGSGGGSG", but the program does not handle this case.

The program only considers the case where two segments of golden trophies are separated by a single silver trophy, and it does not handle the general case where two trophies can be swapped to maximize the length of the subsegment of golden trophies. 

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible pairs of swaps and check if the resulting arrangement has a longer subsegment of golden trophies. 

Here's a possible correct solution:

```python
def func_1(n, trophies):
    def max_golden_subsegment(trophies):
        max_length = 0
        current_length = 0
        for trophy in trophies:
            if trophy == 'G':
                current_length += 1
                max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            else:
                current_length = 0
        return max_length

    max_length = max_golden_subsegment(trophies)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            swapped_trophies = list(trophies)
            swapped_trophies[i], swapped_trophies[j] = swapped_trophies[j], swapped_trophies[i]
            max_length = max(max_length, max_golden_subsegment(swapped_trophies))
    return max_length
```

This solution checks all possible pairs of swaps and updates the maximum length of the subsegment of golden trophies if a longer subsegment is found.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` equals `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `n` is unchanged, and `trophies` remains the same as its original value.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` equals `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `n` is unchanged, and `trophies` remains the same as its original value, and `segments` is not empty
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns max_length which is the length of the sequence of 'G's in the string 'trophies', calculated as end - start + 1 where start and end are the elements of the single tuple in segments
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` equals `n`, `n` is unchanged, `trophies` remains the same as its original value, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `segments` is not empty, and `segments` has more than one element, `max_length` equals the maximum length of sequences of 'G's found in `trophies`, calculated as `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` equals `len(segments) - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `trophies` remains the same as its original value, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `max_length` is the maximum length of consecutive sequences of 'G's found in `trophies`.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` plus one, and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of 'G's in a given string `trophies`, considering sequences separated by a single 'S' character, and returns the minimum value between this calculated length plus one and the total length of the string `n`. The function handles edge cases where `trophies` contains no 'G's (returning 0), a single sequence of 'G's (returning the length of this sequence), or multiple sequences of 'G's (returning the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G's plus one and `n`). The function takes two parameters, `n` (the length of the string `trophies`) and `trophies` (the string itself), and returns an integer value based on the sequence of 'G's in `trophies`. The function does not modify the input variables `n` and `trophies`, and its return value is determined by the arrangement of 'G's and 'S's in `trophies`.
