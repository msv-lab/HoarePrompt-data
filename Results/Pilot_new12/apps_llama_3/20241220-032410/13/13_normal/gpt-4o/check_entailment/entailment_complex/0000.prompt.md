You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` equals `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `n` is unchanged, and `trophies` remains the same as its original value.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` equals `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `n` is unchanged, and `trophies` remains the same as its original value, and `segments` is not empty
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns max_length which is the length of the sequence of 'G's in the string 'trophies', calculated as end - start + 1 where start and end are the elements of the single tuple in segments
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` equals `n`, `n` is unchanged, `trophies` remains the same as its original value, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `segments` is not empty, and `segments` has more than one element, `max_length` equals the maximum length of sequences of 'G's found in `trophies`, calculated as `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` equals `len(segments) - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `trophies` remains the same as its original value, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `max_length` is the maximum length of consecutive sequences of 'G's found in `trophies`.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` plus one, and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of 'G's in a given string `trophies`, considering sequences separated by a single 'S' character, and returns the minimum value between this calculated length plus one and the total length of the string `n`. The function handles edge cases where `trophies` contains no 'G's (returning 0), a single sequence of 'G's (returning the length of this sequence), or multiple sequences of 'G's (returning the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G's plus one and `n`). The function takes two parameters, `n` (the length of the string `trophies`) and `trophies` (the string itself), and returns an integer value based on the sequence of 'G's in `trophies`. The function does not modify the input variables `n` and `trophies`, and its return value is determined by the arrangement of 'G's and 'S's in `trophies`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
