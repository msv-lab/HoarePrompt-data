You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
    if not segments:
        return 0
    max_length = max((end - start + 1 for (start, end) in segments))
    if len(segments) == 1:
        return max_length
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        (prev_start, prev_end) = segments[i - 1]
        (curr_start, curr_end) = segments[i]
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1)
    return min(max_length + 1, n)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle all potential cases correctly. It only checks for cases where two segments of golden trophies can be combined into one by swapping two trophies. However, it does not consider cases where there are more than two segments of golden trophies or where the swap can be done at the beginning or end of the string.

For example, consider the input "GGSSGGGG". The program does not correctly identify that the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement can be 6 by swapping the 'S' at the end of the first segment with the 'S' at the beginning of the last segment, resulting in the sequence "GGGGGGSS". However, this example is still not a convincing case since an optimal algorithm should still return the correct answer which is 5 in this case.

However, after deeper analysis we can see that the problem description requires us to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible by swapping two trophies to maximize the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies. In this case, for the given input, the optimal solution will be 5, and the program actually does return the correct answer in this case.

But let's consider another example: "GGGSSGGG". In this case, the program should return 6 but the actual result of the given function will be 6 as well. 

A more convincing counterexample can be constructed with the input "SGGGGGSSG". For this example, the optimal solution will be 7, which can be achieved by swapping the 'S' at the beginning of the string with the 'S' after the first segment of golden trophies, resulting in the sequence "GGGGGGSSG". However, this example is still not a convincing case since an optimal algorithm should still return the correct answer which is 7 in this case, but the provided function also returns the correct answer for this input.

However, after further testing and consideration, we can still find cases where the given function does not behave correctly. Let's consider the input string: "GGGGSSSGG". The longest segment in the original string is 4. We can achieve a longer segment by swapping the 'S' before the last segment with the first 'S' in the sequence of 'S'. This should give a result of 6, but the function in question might not return this result correctly in this case or similar edge cases, however after the test it seems the function is working correctly for this input. So this is not the example we are looking for.

However, after considering even more examples and edge cases we can conclude that the problem is harder than it seems at first and requires more careful consideration of edge cases and the actual problem description.

Let's consider a case when there are only two 'G's in the string and the rest are 'S's and the 'G's are at the start and at the end of the string. For instance: "GS...SG", where there are only 'S's between the two 'G's. The optimal solution in this case would be to swap one of the 'S's with one of the 'G's, which will result in the string: "GG...SS" and the result will be 2, which is a correct answer.

Now let's consider a more complex case, for example: "GGGSSSSG", and we can see that in this case the optimal solution is to swap the 'G' at the end of the string with one of the 'S's after the first segment of 'G's. So, after the swap, we will have: "GGGGSSSG", and the result will be 5, however this is still 1 less than the result that the given function will return for this input.

After all the above considerations, the most convincing counterexample is when we have an input string with several 'G's at the beginning, followed by several 'S's, and then several 'G's at the end. The optimal solution in this case would be to swap one of the 'S's with one of the 'G's to make the longest possible segment of 'G's. 

However, let's look at the problem from a different perspective and consider all possible cases more carefully.

1. If there are no 'G's, then the answer is 0.
2. If there is only one 'G', then the answer is 1.
3. If there are multiple 'G's and no 'S's, then the answer is the total number of 'G's.
4. If there are multiple 'G's and 'S's, then we need to find the longest segment of 'G's that can be formed by swapping at most one 'G' with one 'S'.

Considering these cases, we can see that the problem is not as simple as it seems at first, and the given function might actually be working correctly for all the considered cases.

So, it seems that the given function is actually correct and it correctly handles all the potential cases.

However, a better approach to solve this problem would be to first find the longest segment of 'G's, then try to extend this segment by swapping one 'G' with one 'S'. This can be done by iterating over the string and keeping track of the longest segment of 'G's found so far.

But, the given function seems to be working correctly for all the considered cases, and it's actually quite efficient. 

However, I must correct my previous assessment: after re-examining the problem, I found that I was overcomplicating things. The correct approach to this problem is indeed to iterate over the string, find all segments of 'G's, and then try to combine them by swapping one 'G' with one 'S'. 

And, the given function actually does this, although it's not immediately clear from the code.

So, my previous assessment was incorrect, and I should have said that the given function is actually correct.

Correctness: **False** 

However this is still incorrect, since the function given does return the correct result for the examples provided and all the other cases I've tried.

So the correct answer is actually: Correctness: **True**, since I was unable to find any case where the function does not behave as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
trophies = data[1]
print(func_1(n, trophies))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^5, and trophies is a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.
def func_1(n, trophies):
    segments = []
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        if trophies[i] == 'G':
            start = i
            while i < n and trophies[i] == 'G':
                i += 1
            segments.append((start, i - 1))
        else:
            i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `i` equals `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `n` is unchanged, and `trophies` remains the same as its original value.
    if (not segments) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` equals `n`, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `n` is unchanged, and `trophies` remains the same as its original value, and `segments` is not empty
    max_length = max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)
    if (len(segments) == 1) :
        return max_length
        #The program returns max_length which is the length of the sequence of 'G's in the string 'trophies', calculated as end - start + 1 where start and end are the elements of the single tuple in segments
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `i` equals `n`, `n` is unchanged, `trophies` remains the same as its original value, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `segments` is not empty, and `segments` has more than one element, `max_length` equals the maximum length of sequences of 'G's found in `trophies`, calculated as `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`
    for i in range(1, len(segments)):
        prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]
        
        curr_start, curr_end = segments[i]
        
        if curr_start - prev_end == 2:
            max_length = max(max_length, curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end -
                prev_start + 1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `i` equals `len(segments) - 1`, `n` is unchanged, `trophies` remains the same as its original value, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `max_length` is the maximum length of consecutive sequences of 'G's found in `trophies`.
    return min(max_length + 1, n)
    #The program returns the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` plus one, and `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:This function calculates the minimum length of consecutive sequences of 'G's in a given string `trophies`, considering sequences separated by a single 'S' character, and returns the minimum value between this calculated length plus one and the total length of the string `n`. The function handles edge cases where `trophies` contains no 'G's (returning 0), a single sequence of 'G's (returning the length of this sequence), or multiple sequences of 'G's (returning the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G's plus one and `n`). The function takes two parameters, `n` (the length of the string `trophies`) and `trophies` (the string itself), and returns an integer value based on the sequence of 'G's in `trophies`. The function does not modify the input variables `n` and `trophies`, and its return value is determined by the arrangement of 'G's and 'S's in `trophies`.
