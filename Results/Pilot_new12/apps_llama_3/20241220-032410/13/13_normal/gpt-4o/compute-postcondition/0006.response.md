The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` is 0, so after the increment, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of at least two leading 'G's, `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `start` is 0**
