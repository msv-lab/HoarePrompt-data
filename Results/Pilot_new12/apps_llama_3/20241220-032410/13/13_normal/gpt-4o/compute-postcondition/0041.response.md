Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's. If `trophies[i]` equals 'G', then `i` is the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` after the initial `i` or equals `n` if all remaining characters are 'G', `start` equals the initial value of `i`, and `segments` is a list containing a tuple `(start, i - 1)`. If `trophies[i]` does not equal 'G', then `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and there must be at least one 'S' in `trophies` from index `i` to the end.***
