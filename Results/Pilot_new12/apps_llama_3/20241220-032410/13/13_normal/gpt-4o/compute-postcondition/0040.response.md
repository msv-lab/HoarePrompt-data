The code increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial state specifies that `i` is less than `n`, so after incrementing `i`, it is still less than or equal to `n`. The character at index `i` in `trophies` was 'S' before the increment, but after the increment, the character at the new index `i` is unknown. However, since there must be at least one 'S' in `trophies` from the old index `i` to the end, and the old index `i` has been moved past, there must still be at least one 'S' in `trophies` from the new index `i` to the end. The value of `n` and the string `trophies` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, there must be at least one 'S' in `trophies` from index `i` to the end**
