The value of `max_length` is calculated as `end - start + 1` where `start` and `end` are the elements of the single tuple in `segments`. Since `segments` contains exactly one tuple representing a sequence of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `max_length` equals the length of this sequence found in `trophies`. 
Output State: **The program returns max_length which is the length of the sequence of 'G's in the string 'trophies', calculated as end - start + 1 where start and end are the elements of the single tuple in segments**
