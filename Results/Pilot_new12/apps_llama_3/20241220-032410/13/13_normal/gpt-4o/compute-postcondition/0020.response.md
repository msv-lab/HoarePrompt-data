According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on two conditions: `i` must be less than `n`, and `trophies[i]` must be equal to 'G'. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than or equal to `n` and equal to `start + 1`, and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be strictly less than `n` (because the loop condition is `i < n`), and `trophies[i]` must be 'G'. 

Given that `i` is equal to `start + 1`, for `i` to be strictly less than `n`, `start` must be less than `n - 1`. 

Since `trophies` is not all 'G's, but `trophies[i]` must be 'G' for the loop to execute again, no additional constraints are needed on `trophies` beyond what is already given.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's, `i` is less than `n` and equal to `start + 1`, `start` is less than `n - 1` and `trophies[i]` is 'G'**
