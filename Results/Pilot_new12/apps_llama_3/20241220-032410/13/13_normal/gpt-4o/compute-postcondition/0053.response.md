Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has more than one element, `max_length` is calculated based on `segments` and is not empty, `prev_start` is the start of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end of the first segment, `curr_start` is the start of the second segment, `curr_end` is the end of the second segment. The current value of `curr_start` and `prev_end` are such that `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, meaning there is a difference of 2 units between the start of the second segment and the end of the first segment.**
