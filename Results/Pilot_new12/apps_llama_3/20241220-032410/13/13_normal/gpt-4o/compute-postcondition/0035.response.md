To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions of the `while` loop:

1. `i < n`: This condition requires that `i` is less than `n`. Since at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is already less than `n` but incremented by 1 from its previous value, for the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than `n`. This implies that `i` should not have reached `n` yet.

2. `trophies[i] == 'G'`: This condition requires that the character at index `i` in the `trophies` string is 'G'. For the loop to execute again, this condition must hold true after incrementing `i`. Therefore, the next character in the sequence (at index `i+1`) must also be 'G'.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5.
- `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's.
- `i` is greater than its initial value, less than `n`, and incremented by 1 from its previous value.
- `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`.
- There is at least one 'S' in `trophies` from index `i+1` to the end.

Adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` must still be less than `n`, which means `i` should be incremented but not reach `n`.
- `trophies[i]` after incrementing `i` must be 'G', meaning the next character in `trophies` must be 'G'.
- The condition that there is at least one 'S' in `trophies` from index `i+1` to the end remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop's ability to execute one more time based on the current conditions.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's with `trophies[i+1]` being 'G', `i` is greater than its initial value, less than `n`, and incremented by 1 from its previous value, `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, and there is at least one 'S' in `trophies` from index `i+2` to the end**
