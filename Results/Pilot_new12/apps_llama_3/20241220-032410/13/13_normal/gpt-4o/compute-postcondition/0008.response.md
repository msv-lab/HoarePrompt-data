The code increments the value of `i` by 1. The initial value of `i` is 1, so the new value of `i` is 2. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of at least three leading 'G's, `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 2, `start` is 0**
