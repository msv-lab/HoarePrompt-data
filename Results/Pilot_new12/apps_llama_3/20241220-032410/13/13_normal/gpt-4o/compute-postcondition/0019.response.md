The code increments `i` by 1. Since `i` is initially less than `n`, after the increment, `i` will be equal to `i + 1`, which is still less than or equal to `n`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's, `i` is less than or equal to `n` and equal to `start + 1`, `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`**
