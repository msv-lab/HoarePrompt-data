The given Python code changes the values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` based on the current value of `i` and the elements of `segments`. 

Given the initial state: `i` is 3, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has at least 4 elements, `prev_start` is the start of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end of the first segment, `curr_start` equals `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[3][1]`.

The code `prev_start, prev_end = segments[i - 1]` assigns `prev_start` and `prev_end` the start and end of the segment at index `i - 1`. Given `i` is 3, `i - 1` equals 2. Therefore, `prev_start` and `prev_end` are assigned the start and end of the segment at index 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has at least 4 elements, `prev_start` equals `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` equals `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[3][1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has at least 4 elements, `prev_start` equals `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` equals `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[3][1]`.**
