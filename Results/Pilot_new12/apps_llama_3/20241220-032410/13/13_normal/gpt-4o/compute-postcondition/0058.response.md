The given code updates the values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` based on the `i`-th index of the `segments` list. 
Since `i` is 2, `curr_start` and `curr_end` will be updated to the start and end of the third segment, which they already are. 
However, the values are explicitly reassigned based on `segments[2]`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has at least 3 elements, `prev_start` is the start of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end of the first segment, `curr_start` is the start of the third segment which equals `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` is the end of the third segment which equals `segments[2][1]`**
