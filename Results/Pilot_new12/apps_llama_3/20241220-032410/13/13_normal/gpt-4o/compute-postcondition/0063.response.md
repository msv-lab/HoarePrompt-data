The code updates the values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` based on the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 3, `curr_start` and `curr_end` will be assigned the values of `segments[3][0]` and `segments[3][1]`, respectively.

However, since `curr_start` already equals `segments[3][0]` and `curr_end` already equals `segments[3][1]`, their values remain unchanged.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has at least 4 elements, `prev_start` equals `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` equals `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[3][1]`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has at least 4 elements, `prev_start` equals `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` equals `segments[2][1]`, `curr_start` equals `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[3][1]`.**
