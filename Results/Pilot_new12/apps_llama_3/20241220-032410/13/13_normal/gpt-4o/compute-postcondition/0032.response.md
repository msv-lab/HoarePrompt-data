The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains the same, which is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5. The string `trophies` also remains the same, with a length of `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's. The value of `start` remains equal to the initial value of `i`. Since `i` was incremented, it is now less than or equal to `n`, but still greater than its initial value. There must still be at least one 'S' in `trophies` from the new index `i` to the end, because `i` was initially at a 'G' and there was at least one 'S' after it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's, `i` is greater than its initial value and less than or equal to `n`, `start` is equal to the initial value of `i`, and there is at least one 'S' in `trophies` from index `i` to the end**
