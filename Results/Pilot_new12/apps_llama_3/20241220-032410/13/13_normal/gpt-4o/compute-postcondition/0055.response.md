Postcondition: **`i` is 1, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has more than one element, `prev_start` is the start of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end of the first segment, `curr_start` is the start of the second segment, `curr_end` is the end of the second segment, and if `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` is the maximum of its previous value and `curr_end - prev_start + 1`, otherwise `max_length` remains unchanged**
