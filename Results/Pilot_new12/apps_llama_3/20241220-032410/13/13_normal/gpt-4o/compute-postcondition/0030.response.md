The value of `start` is assigned the value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's, `i` must be less than `n`, `start` is equal to `i`, and there must be at least one 'S' in `trophies` from index `i` to the end.
