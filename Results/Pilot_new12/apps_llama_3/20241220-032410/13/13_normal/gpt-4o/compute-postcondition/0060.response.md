Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has at least 3 elements, `prev_start` is the start of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end of the first segment, `curr_start` equals `segments[2][0]`, `curr_end` equals `segments[2][1]`. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, then `max_length` equals the maximum of its previous value and `(curr_end - curr_start + 1) + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`. If `curr_start - prev_end` is not equal to 2, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
