Postcondition: **`i` equals `n`, `n` is unchanged, `trophies` remains the same as its original value, `segments` contains tuples representing all sequences of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, `segments` is not empty, and `segments` has more than one element, `max_length` equals the maximum length of sequences of 'G's found in `trophies`, calculated as `max(end - start + 1 for start, end in segments)`**
