Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. If the string `trophies` starts with one or more 'G's, `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(0, i - 1)`, where `i` is the number of leading 'G's in `trophies`, or `n` if all characters in `trophies` are 'G's, and `i` is equal to the number of leading 'G's. If the string `trophies` starts with 'S', `segments` is an empty list and `i` is 1.***
