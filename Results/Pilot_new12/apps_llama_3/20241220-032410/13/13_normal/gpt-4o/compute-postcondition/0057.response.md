The code reassigns the values of `prev_start` and `prev_end` based on the current value of `i` and the elements of `segments`. Given that `i` is 2, we are looking at the third segment (since indexing starts at 0), and we are updating `prev_start` and `prev_end` to the start and end of the segment before the current one, which is the second segment.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has at least 3 elements, `prev_start` is the start of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end of the first segment, `curr_start` is the start of the third segment, `curr_end` is the end of the third segment**
