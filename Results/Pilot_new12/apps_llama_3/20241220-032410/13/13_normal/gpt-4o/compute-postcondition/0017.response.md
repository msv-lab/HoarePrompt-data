The code assigns the value of `i` to a new variable `start`. The previous values of `n` and `trophies` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's, or if `trophies` starts with 'S' then `i` is less than `n`, `start` is equal to `i`**
