Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's. If `trophies[i]` is 'G', then `i` is equal to the index of the first 'S' in `trophies` starting from the initial `i`, or `n` if all characters from the initial `i` to the end are 'G', `start` remains equal to the initial value of `i`, `n` remains unchanged, and `segments` contains a tuple `(start, i - 1)`. If `trophies[i]` is 'S', then `i` is incremented, `trophies[i-1]` was 'S' before increment, and the other variables remain as initially described, with `n` unchanged and `trophies` having the same properties as initially stated.***
