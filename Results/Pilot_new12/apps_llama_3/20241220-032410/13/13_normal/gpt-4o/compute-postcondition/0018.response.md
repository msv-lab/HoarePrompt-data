To ensure the loop can execute at least one time, we need to consider the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `i < n` and `trophies[i] == 'G'`.

1. **Condition `i < n`:** For this condition to be true, since `n` is already given as an integer such that `2 <= n <= 10^5`, we don't need to adjust `n`. However, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `n`. The initial state mentions `start` is equal to `i`, but it doesn't specify the value of `i` relative to `n`. Thus, we need `i` to be less than `n`.

2. **Condition `trophies[i] == 'G'`:** The string `trophies` consists of characters 'G' and 'S' and is not all 'G's, or if `trophies` starts with 'S' then `i` is less than `n`. For the loop to execute, the character at index `i` in `trophies` must be 'G'. Given that not all characters in `trophies` are 'G', we need to ensure that the character at the starting index `i` is 'G'.

Considering both conditions, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` must be less than `n`.
- The character at index `i` in `trophies` must be 'G'.

Thus, the adjusted state is:
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's, `i` is less than `n`, and `trophies[i]` is 'G', `start` is equal to `i`**
