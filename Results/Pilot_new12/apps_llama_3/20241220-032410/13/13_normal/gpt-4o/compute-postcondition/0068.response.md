The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following conditions: 
Case_1: The program returns 0; 
Case_2: The program returns `max_length` which is the length of the sequence of 'G's in the string `trophies`; 
Case_3: The program returns the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G's in `trophies` plus one, and `n`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S', and return a value based on the sequence of 'G's in `trophies`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and trophies, returns a value based on the sequence of 'G's in trophies, which can be 0, the length of the sequence of 'G's, or the minimum value between the maximum length of consecutive 'G's plus one and n.**
