The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was less than `n`, so the new value of `i` is `i + 1` which is less than or equal to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's, or if `trophies` starts with 'S' then `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `trophies[i-1]` was 'S' before increment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^5, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S' and not all 'G's, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, and `trophies[i-1]` was 'S' before increment**
