Postcondition: **`i` equals `n`, `n` is unchanged, `trophies` remains the same as its original value, `segments` contains exactly one tuple representing a sequence of 'G's in the original string `trophies`, and `max_length` equals the length of this sequence found in `trophies`, calculated as `end - start + 1` where `start` and `end` are the elements of the single tuple in `segments`.**
