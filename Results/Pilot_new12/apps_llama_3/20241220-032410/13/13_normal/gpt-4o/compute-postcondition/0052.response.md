The given code assigns the start and end of the second segment (`segments[i]` where `i` is 1) to `curr_start` and `curr_end` respectively. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 1, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has more than one element, `max_length` is calculated based on `segments` and is not empty, `prev_start` is the start of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end of the first segment, `curr_start` is the start of the second segment, `curr_end` is the end of the second segment.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` equals 1, `trophies` remains unchanged, `segments` has more than one element, `max_length` is calculated based on `segments` and is not empty, `prev_start` is the start of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end of the first segment, `curr_start` is the start of the second segment, `curr_end` is the end of the second segment**
