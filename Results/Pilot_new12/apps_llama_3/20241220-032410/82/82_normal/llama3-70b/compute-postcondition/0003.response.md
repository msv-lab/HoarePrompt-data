The given code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, and then updates `b` to be the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`. 

Since `a` is the original `b`, and `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, after the code is executed, `a` becomes the original `b`, and `b` becomes the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`. 

Given that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a >= b`, and `b` must be greater than 0, the new `a` (which is the original `b`) is still a positive integer such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, and the new `b` (which is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`) is still a non-negative integer less than the original `b`. 

Also, note that since `b` is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, `b` is less than `a` if `b` is not zero. 

So the new `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= b <= a <= 10^9`, and `b` must be greater than or equal to 0, but since `b` is the remainder, `b` can be 0. 

But we also know `a >= b`, and since we swapped `a` and `b`, `b` becomes the new `a` and the remainder becomes the new `b`, which still holds `a >= b` because `b` is the remainder and will be less than or equal to `a`. 

However, the condition `b > 0` must hold for the original `b`, and since `a` becomes `b` and `b` becomes the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, we must ensure that `b` is not zero for the original `a` and `b`. 

So after the code is executed, `a` is the original `b`, `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, both are integers such that `1 <= a <= 10^9`, `a >= b`, and `b` is less than the original `b` but can be zero.

However, in the context of the Euclidean algorithm that this code seems to be a part of, `b` will not be zero because the algorithm stops when `b` is zero, and this step is part of the reduction of `a` and `b` towards that end.

Therefore, considering the operation performed, the output state is: `a` is the original `b`, `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, both are positive integers such that `1 <= b <= a <= 10^9`, `a >= b`, and `b` is less than the original `b` but greater than or equal to 0. However, for this specific operation `b` is greater than 0 because `b` was the remainder of `a` divided by `b` which means the original `b` was not zero.

Output State: **`a` is the original `b`, `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, both are positive integers such that `1 <= b <= a <= 10^9`, `a >= b`, and `b` is greater than 0**
