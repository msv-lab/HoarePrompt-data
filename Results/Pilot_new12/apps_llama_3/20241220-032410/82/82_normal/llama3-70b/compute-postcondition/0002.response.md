Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers, and returns the floor division of their product by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` does not return zero, as division by zero would result in an error. The result is an integer, truncated towards zero, representing the quotient of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. Note that the function does not perform any error checking on the inputs `a` and `b` to verify they are indeed positive integers, nor does it handle the potential case where `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-integer or zero. The final state of the program after execution will be the return value, which is the calculated floor division result.**
