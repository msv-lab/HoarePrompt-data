According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must not be 0. 

Since `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, and both `a` and `b` are positive integers, `b` will be 0 if and only if the original `a` is exactly divisible by the original `b`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the original `a` must not be exactly divisible by the original `b`, meaning `b` must not be equal to 0 after the previous iteration.

State: **`a` is the original `b`, `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b` and `b` must not be 0**
