To calculate the output state, we need to understand the return statement. The return statement is `return a * b // func_1(a, b)`. Here, `a` and `b` are positive integers. The function `func_1(a, b)` is not defined in the given problem, so we will consider it as a function that takes two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns a value.

The `//` operator in Python performs floor division, which means it divides the number before it by the number after it and returns the largest possible integer.

Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, `a * b` will also be a positive integer. However, without knowing the exact nature or return value of `func_1(a, b)`, we cannot determine the exact result of `a * b // func_1(a, b)`.

But we can say that the program returns the result of the floor division of the product of `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`, where `a` and `b` are positive integers.

Output State: **The program returns the floor division of the product of two positive integers `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`**
