To calculate the output state, let's analyze the information provided. 

Given that `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0, we need to understand what happens when `b` is 0 in the context of GCD.

The GCD of two numbers is the largest positive integer that divides both numbers without leaving a remainder. However, when one of the numbers is 0, the GCD is defined as the absolute value of the other number. This is because any number is a divisor of 0, but by convention, the GCD is taken to be the absolute value of the non-zero number.

Since `b` is 0, `a` would be the GCD of the original `a` and 0, which means `a` is the absolute value of the original `a`.

Therefore, the program returns `a`, which is the absolute value of the original `a`.

Output State: **The program returns the absolute value of the original 'a'**
