Correctness: **False**

The code is attempting to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is minimized. However, the code has a flaw in its approach. 

The code starts with `k=0` and increments `k` until the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` is no longer decreasing. It then prints `k-1` as the solution. 

However, this approach does not guarantee the optimal solution. The code does not consider the case where the LCM might decrease again after increasing for some values of `k`. 

For example, consider the case where `a=6` and `b=15`. The correct answer is `k=3` because the LCM of `6+3=9` and `15+3=18` is `18`, which is smaller than the LCM of `6` and `15` which is `30`. However, the code will start with `k=0` and find that the LCM of `6` and `15` is `30`, then it will increment `k` to `1` and find that the LCM of `7` and `16` is `112`, which is larger than `30`, so it will stop and print `k-1=0`, which is incorrect.

The annotations of the functions `func_1` and `func_2` describe the correct behavior of these functions, but they do not help in identifying the flaw in the main algorithm.

To solve this problem correctly, we need to find the correct approach, which is to calculate the LCM for all possible values of `k` and find the minimum one. This could be achieved by iterating over all possible values of `k` and calculating the LCM for each one, or by using a more clever approach to find the optimal value of `k` directly.
