You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it does not actually calculate the smallest non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple of a+k and b+k is the smallest possible.

In the provided code, there are two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers respectively. However, there is no function or logic that attempts to find the smallest non-negative integer k that minimizes the least common multiple of a+k and b+k.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should iterate over possible values of k, calculate the least common multiple of a+k and b+k for each k, and return the smallest k that results in the smallest least common multiple. The provided code does not perform this calculation, so it is incorrect.

For example, if we input a = 6 and b = 10, the code should return k = 2 because the least common multiple of 6+2 and 10+2 is 24, which is the smallest possible. However, the provided code does not have the logic to calculate this result, so it will not produce the correct answer for this example.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers, and returns the floor division of their product by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` does not return zero, as division by zero would result in an error. The result is an integer, truncated towards zero, representing the quotient of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. Note that the function does not perform any error checking on the inputs `a` and `b` to verify they are indeed positive integers, nor does it handle the potential case where `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-integer or zero. The final state of the program after execution will be the return value, which is the calculated floor division result.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
