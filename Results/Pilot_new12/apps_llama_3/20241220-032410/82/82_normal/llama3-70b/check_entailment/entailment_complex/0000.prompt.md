You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Annotated Functions:
import math

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
k = 0
min_lcm = func_2(a, b)
while True:
    if func_2(a + k, b + k) < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    else:
        break
    k += 1
print(k - 1)

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns the absolute value of the original 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD), not the absolute value of the original `a` as stated in the annotations. The function does not return the absolute value of `a` as the annotations suggest, but rather it calculates and returns the GCD of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. The state of the program after it concludes is that `a` has been overwritten with the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0. The function handles all positive integer inputs correctly, including edge cases where `a` or `b` is 1, or where `a` equals `b`. There is no handling for cases where `a` or `b` is not a positive integer, which could potentially lead to incorrect results or errors.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers.
def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)
    #The program returns the floor division of the product of two positive integers `a` and `b` by the result of `func_1(a, b)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers, and returns the floor division of their product by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. The function assumes that `func_1(a, b)` does not return zero, as division by zero would result in an error. The result is an integer, truncated towards zero, representing the quotient of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. Note that the function does not perform any error checking on the inputs `a` and `b` to verify they are indeed positive integers, nor does it handle the potential case where `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-integer or zero. The final state of the program after execution will be the return value, which is the calculated floor division result.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
