Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the solution to the problem described. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The program starts by reading two integers `a` and `b` from the input.
2. It initializes `k` to 0 and calculates the initial least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b` using the `func_2` function, which correctly implements the formula for LCM: `lcm(a, b) = a * b / gcd(a, b)`.
3. The program then enters a loop where it increments `k` by 1 and calculates the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k`. If the new LCM is less than the current minimum LCM, it updates the minimum LCM.
4. The loop continues until the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k` is not less than the current minimum LCM, at which point the program breaks out of the loop.
5. Finally, the program prints the value of `k - 1`, which is the smallest non-negative integer `k` that results in the smallest possible LCM of `a + k` and `b + k`.

The program works correctly for several reasons:

* The `func_1` function correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.
* The `func_2` function correctly calculates the LCM of two numbers using the formula `lcm(a, b) = a * b / gcd(a, b)`.
* The loop in the main program correctly finds the smallest non-negative integer `k` that results in the smallest possible LCM of `a + k` and `b + k`.
* The program prints the correct value of `k` by subtracting 1 from the final value of `k`, which is the smallest non-negative integer that results in the smallest possible LCM.

Overall, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem described, and it should produce the correct output for all valid inputs.
