Correctness: **True**

The code provided is designed to solve the problem of finding the smallest non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple (LCM) of a+k and b+k is the smallest possible. 

Function `func_1(a, b)` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. This GCD is then used in function `func_2(a, b)` to calculate the LCM of a and b by dividing the product of a and b by their GCD.

The main part of the program iterates over possible values of k, starting from 0, and stops when adding k no longer decreases the LCM of a+k and b+k. It then prints the last k that resulted in the smallest LCM.

This approach is correct because the LCM of two numbers is minimized when their difference is minimized, which happens when their GCD is maximized. By iterating over k and checking the LCM, the program effectively finds the smallest k that maximizes the GCD of a+k and b+k, thus minimizing their LCM.

Given that the input will always be valid (two positive integers), and the functions `func_1` and `func_2` correctly calculate the GCD and LCM respectively, the program will always find the correct smallest k that minimizes the LCM of a+k and b+k. The provided examples also demonstrate that the program works correctly for different test cases.
