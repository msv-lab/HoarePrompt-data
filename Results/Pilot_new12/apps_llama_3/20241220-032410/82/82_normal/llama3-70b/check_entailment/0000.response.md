Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it does not actually calculate the smallest non-negative integer k such that the least common multiple of a+k and b+k is the smallest possible.

In the provided code, there are two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which calculate the greatest common divisor and the least common multiple of two numbers respectively. However, there is no function or logic that attempts to find the smallest non-negative integer k that minimizes the least common multiple of a+k and b+k.

To correctly solve the problem, the code should iterate over possible values of k, calculate the least common multiple of a+k and b+k for each k, and return the smallest k that results in the smallest least common multiple. The provided code does not perform this calculation, so it is incorrect.

For example, if we input a = 6 and b = 10, the code should return k = 2 because the least common multiple of 6+2 and 10+2 is 24, which is the smallest possible. However, the provided code does not have the logic to calculate this result, so it will not produce the correct answer for this example.
