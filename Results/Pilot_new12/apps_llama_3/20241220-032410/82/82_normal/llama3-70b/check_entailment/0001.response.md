Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` seem to be implementations of the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of two numbers, respectively. However, the program does not actually use these functions to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` is the smallest possible.

The problem requires a program that can iterate through possible values of `k` and calculate the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` for each `k`, then return the smallest `k` that results in the smallest LCM. The provided program does not perform this task.

For example, given the input `6 10`, the program does not calculate the LCM of `6+k` and `10+k` for different values of `k` to find the smallest `k` that results in the smallest LCM. As a result, it will not return the correct answer `2` for this input.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to iterate through possible values of `k`, calculate the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` for each `k`, and return the smallest `k` that results in the smallest LCM. 

Here's a corrected version of the program:
```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_k(a, b):
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1000000): # you can adjust this range based on your requirements
        new_a = a + k
        new_b = b + k
        new_lcm = lcm(new_a, new_b)
        if new_lcm < min_lcm:
            min_lcm = new_lcm
            min_k = k
    return min_k

a, b = map(int, input().split())
print(find_k(a, b))
```
