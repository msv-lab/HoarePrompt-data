The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, both of which are expected to be positive integers, and returns the result of the floor division of their product by the result of `func_1(x, y)`. The function does not modify the input variables `x` and `y`. However, the code does not include any error handling for cases where `x` or `y` are not positive integers, or where `func_1(x, y)` returns zero, which would result in a ZeroDivisionError. The function assumes that `func_1(x, y)` will always return a non-zero value. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns an integer value representing the floor division result, without alteringing the original state of `x` and `y`.
