Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_3` attempts to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` is the smallest possible. However, the function only checks for values of `k` that are factors of the difference between `a` and `b`, and rounds up both `a` and `b` to the nearest multiple of `k`.

The code does not consider the case where the smallest LCM is achieved by a value of `k` that is not a factor of the difference between `a` and `b`. For example, if `a = 8` and `b = 12`, the smallest LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` is achieved when `k = 4`, because `8+4 = 12` and `12+4 = 16`, and the LCM of `12` and `16` is `48`, which is smaller than the LCM of `8` and `12` which is `24`. However, `4` is not a factor of the difference between `8` and `12`, which is `4`, so `func_3` will not consider this case.

Additionally, the function `func_3` does not check if the found `k` is indeed the smallest non-negative integer that achieves the smallest LCM. The function only checks if the current LCM is smaller than the minimum LCM found so far, but it does not check if the current `k` is smaller than the minimum `k` found so far that achieves the same LCM. 

Therefore, the code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case.
