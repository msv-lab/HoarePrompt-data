Correctness: **False**

The given Python code attempts to solve the problem by iterating over the factors of the difference between the two input integers `a` and `b`. However, it does not correctly find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is the smallest possible.

One potential issue is that the code only checks the factors of the difference between `a` and `b`, but it does not consider all possible values of `k`. The code should iterate over all values of `k` up to the point where the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` is guaranteed to be larger than the smallest possible LCM found so far.

Another issue is that the code does not correctly calculate the smallest possible LCM for each factor. It uses the `func_2` function to calculate the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` after rounding them up to the nearest multiple of the factor, but it does not consider the fact that `k` itself can be adjusted to achieve a smaller LCM.

For example, if `a = 6` and `b = 10`, the code returns `2`, which is correct. However, if `a = 7` and `b = 10`, the code may not return the correct result because it only checks the factors of the difference between `a` and `b`, which is `3`. The correct result for this case is `k = 1`, which the code may not find.

To fix these issues, the code should be modified to iterate over all possible values of `k` and to correctly calculate the smallest possible LCM for each value of `k`. This can be done by iterating over all values of `k` up to the maximum of `a` and `b`, and by using a more efficient algorithm to calculate the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k`.
