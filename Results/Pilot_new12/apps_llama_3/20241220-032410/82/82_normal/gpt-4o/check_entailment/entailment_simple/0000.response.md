Correctness: **False**

The program does not always do what the problem description says. The problem description asks to find the smallest non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. However, the program only checks factors of the absolute difference between $a$ and $b$, and does not consider all possible non-negative integers $k$.

In the function `func_3`, the program only iterates over the factors of the absolute difference between $a$ and $b`, and checks if adding these factors to $a$ and $b$ results in a smaller LCM. However, this does not guarantee that the program will find the smallest $k$ that achieves the smallest LCM.

For example, consider the case where $a=6$ and $b=10$. The program will check the factors of the absolute difference $|a-b|=4$, which are $1, 2, 4$. However, the smallest $k$ that achieves the smallest LCM is actually $k=2$, but the program may not necessarily return this value.

A correct program would need to iterate over all possible non-negative integers $k$, and check if adding $k$ to $a$ and $b$ results in a smaller LCM. This can be done using a separate function to calculate the LCM of two numbers, and then iterating over all possible $k$ to find the smallest one that achieves the smallest LCM.

Here is an example of a correct program:
```python
import math

def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def lcm(a, b):
    return a * b // gcd(a, b)

def find_smallest_k(a, b):
    min_lcm = float('inf')
    min_k = 0
    for k in range(1000000):  # iterate over a large range of k
        new_a = a + k
        new_b = b + k
        current_lcm = lcm(new_a, new_b)
        if current_lcm < min_lcm:
            min_lcm = current_lcm
            min_k = k
        elif current_lcm == min_lcm:
            min_k = min(min_k, k)
    return min_k

# read input
a, b = map(int, input().split())

# print result
print(find_smallest_k(a, b))
```
This program correctly finds the smallest non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible, by iterating over a large range of $k$ and checking if adding $k$ to $a$ and $b$ results in a smaller LCM.
