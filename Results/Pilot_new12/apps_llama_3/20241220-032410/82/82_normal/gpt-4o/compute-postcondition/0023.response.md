To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for candidate in [k, diff // k]:`. This means that the loop will iterate over the list `[k, diff // k]`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `k` is 2, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. 

For the loop to execute again, `candidate` must take the next value in the list `[k, diff // k]`. 

Since `candidate` has already taken the value of `k` (which is 2) in the previous iteration, in the next iteration, it will take the value of `diff // k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `k` is 2, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` is `(b + diff // k - 1) // (diff // k) * (diff // k)`, `candidate` is `diff // k`**
