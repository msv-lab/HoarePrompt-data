According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `diff`. If `k` is less than the square root of `diff`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` has iterated over a factor of `diff`, so for the loop to execute again `k` must be increased by 1. 
Since `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, and `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `diff` remains unchanged.
Also, the state of `min_lcm` and `min_k` depends on whether `diff` is divisible by `k` or not, but in the given loop, the states of `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be adjusted in the loop body which is omitted.
So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is the previous value of `k` plus 1, if `diff` is divisible by `k`, then the state of `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be updated in the loop body, otherwise the state of `min_lcm` and `min_k` remains unchanged**
