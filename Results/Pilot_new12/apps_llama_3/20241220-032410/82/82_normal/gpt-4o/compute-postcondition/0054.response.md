Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. If the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` is less than `min_lcm` or if the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` is equal to `min_lcm` but `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` and `min_k` is updated to `diff // k`.***
