Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, the current value of `current_lcm` is less than the current value of `min_lcm`, or the current value of `current_lcm` is equal to the current value of `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than the current value of `min_k`, and `min_lcm` and `min_k` are in their updated states based on these conditions**
