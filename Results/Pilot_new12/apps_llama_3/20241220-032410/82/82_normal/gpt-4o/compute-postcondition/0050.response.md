To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is at least `k`.
- `k` is at least 2.
- `candidate` is `diff // k`.
- `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

The code provided is:
```python
new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

This line of code calculates `new_b` by first adding `candidate - 1` to `b`, then performing integer division by `candidate`, and finally multiplying the result by `candidate`. The effect of this operation is to round `b` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

Given that `candidate` is `diff // k`, and knowing that `diff` is at least `k` (which is at least 2), `candidate` is a positive integer because both `diff` and `k` are integers and `k` is non-zero.

Since `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and now `new_b` is calculated as the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, we can infer that both `new_a` and `new_b` are multiples of `candidate`.

The value of `new_b` will be the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, which means it rounds `b` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate` if `b` is not already a multiple of `candidate`.

The output state, considering the initial conditions and the effect of the code, is:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is at least `k`.
- `k` is at least 2.
- `candidate` is `diff // k`.
- `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
