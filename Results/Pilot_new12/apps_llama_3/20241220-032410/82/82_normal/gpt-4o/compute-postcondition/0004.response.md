The code sets `min_lcm` to positive infinity. The initial state's conditions on `a` and `b` and the definition of `diff` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, and `min_lcm` is positive infinity.**
