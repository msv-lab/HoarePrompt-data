To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop statement and the current state.

Given loop statement:
```python
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```
Current state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0.
- `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.
- `candidate` is `diff // k`.
- `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.
- `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated based on the comparison with `current_lcm` and `candidate`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next possible value of `candidate`. Since the loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`, if the previous iteration was for `k`, the next iteration should be for `diff // k`, and vice versa.

Assuming the previous iteration was for `candidate = k`, we adjust the states as follows:
- `candidate` should now be `diff // k`.
- Since `candidate` changes, `new_a` and `new_b` should be recalculated based on the new `candidate`.
- `current_lcm` will be updated once the loop body is executed with the new `candidate`.

If the previous iteration was for `candidate = diff // k`, the loop would actually terminate because there are no more values to iterate over in the list `[k, diff // k]`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, assuming it hasn't terminated yet, we are considering the scenario where the first iteration was for `k`, and we are now moving to the second iteration for `diff // k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is `k` and then `diff // k`, `new_a` and `new_b` are to be recalculated based on `diff // k`, `current_lcm` is to be updated based on new `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be updated according to the comparison rules**
