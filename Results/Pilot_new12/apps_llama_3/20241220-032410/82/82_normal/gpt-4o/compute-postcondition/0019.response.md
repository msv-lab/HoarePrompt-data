To calculate the output state, we first need to understand what `func_2(new_a, new_b)` does, but since its implementation is not provided, we will assume it calculates the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`. Given the initial state:

- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is `abs(a - b)`.
- `min_lcm` is either positive infinity or the minimum LCM found so far.
- `min_k` is either 0 or the `candidate` resulting in the minimum `min_lcm`.
- `k` is 2.
- `diff` is divisible by `k`.
- `new_a` is `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`.
- `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

The impact of this code on the program is the calculation and assignment of the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` to `current_lcm`. The states of other variables are not directly affected by this operation. 

Given that `new_a = (a + 1) // 2 * 2` and `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and assuming `func_2` calculates the LCM, `current_lcm` will be the LCM of these two values. The exact value of `current_lcm` depends on the values of `a`, `b`, and `candidate`, but it will be the LCM of `(a + 1) // 2 * 2` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is `abs(a - b)`.
- `min_lcm` is either positive infinity or the minimum LCM found so far.
- `min_k` is either 0 or the `candidate` resulting in the minimum `min_lcm`.
- `k` is 2.
- `diff` is divisible by `k`.
- `new_a` is `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`.
- `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, which equals the LCM of `(a + 1) // 2 * 2` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is either positive infinity or the minimum LCM found so far, `min_k` is either 0 or the `candidate` resulting in the minimum `min_lcm`, `k` is 2, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `(a + 1) // 2 * 2` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
