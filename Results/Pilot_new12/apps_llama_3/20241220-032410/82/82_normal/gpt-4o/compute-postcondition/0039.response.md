The code `min_k = candidate` updates the value of `min_k` to be equal to `candidate`. The value of `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`a` and `b` are still positive integers between 1 and 10^9, and `a` is not equal to `b`. `diff` is still at least 1, and it is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`. `k` is still at least 2. `new_a` is still `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `new_b` is still `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. `current_lcm` is still the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is still equal to `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is equal to `candidate`**
