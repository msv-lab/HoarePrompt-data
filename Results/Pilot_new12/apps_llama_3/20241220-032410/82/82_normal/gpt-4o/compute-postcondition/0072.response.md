Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than the previous `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals the previous `min_lcm` but `candidate` is less than the previous `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, otherwise the values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged.***
