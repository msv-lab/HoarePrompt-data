Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, if `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to be the LCM of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `min_k` is updated to be either `k` or `diff // k`, where `candidate` is one of `k` or `diff // k`.***
