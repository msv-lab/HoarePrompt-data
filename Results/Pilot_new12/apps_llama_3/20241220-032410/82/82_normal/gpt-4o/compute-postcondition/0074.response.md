To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9.
   - `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0.
   - `k` is a factor of `diff`.
   - `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.
   - `candidate` is initially `k` and then `diff // k`.
   - `new_a` and `new_b` are to be recalculated based on `diff // k`.
   - `current_lcm` is to be updated based on new `new_a` and `new_b`.
   - `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be updated according to the comparison rules.

2. **Given Code**:
   ```
   new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
   ```
   This line of code calculates `new_a` by first finding the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This is achieved by the expression `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate`, which effectively rounds up `a` to the nearest multiple of `candidate`. The result is then multiplied by `candidate` to get `new_a`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `new_a` is updated based on `a` and `candidate`.
   - The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, and `candidate` remain unchanged by this operation.
   - `new_b` has not been calculated in this step, so its value remains to be determined based on `diff // k` and possibly `new_a`.
   - `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` are not directly affected by this operation but may be updated later based on `new_a` and `new_b`.

4. **Output State**:
   Given the initial conditions and the changes made by the code, the output state is as follows:
   - `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`.
   - `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0.
   - `k` is a factor of `diff` and is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.
   - `candidate` is `k` or `diff // k`.
   - `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
   - `new_b` is to be recalculated based on `diff // k`.
   - `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` are to be updated according to the comparison rules and the new values of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` are pending update based on `diff // k` and the comparison rules.**
