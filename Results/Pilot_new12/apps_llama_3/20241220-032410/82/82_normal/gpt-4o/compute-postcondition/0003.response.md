To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, and `a` is not equal to `b`.

The code calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and assigns it to the variable `diff`.

Given that `a` and `b` are positive integers and `a` is not equal to `b`, the absolute difference `diff = abs(a - b)` will always be a positive integer greater than 0.

The values of `a` and `b` do not change; only a new variable `diff` is introduced.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, and `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`**
