To calculate the output state, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The code assigns the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)` to `current_lcm`. 

Given that `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, we can infer that `new_a` and `new_b` are multiples of `candidate`.

The function `func_2` is not defined in the given problem, but based on its name and the context, it is likely that `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers. 

Therefore, `current_lcm` is assigned the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. Since `new_a` and `new_b` are multiples of `candidate`, their LCM is also a multiple of `candidate`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
