Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is incremented by 1. If `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `min_lcm` is the minimum LCM of the smallest multiples of factors of `diff` (or their corresponding `diff // k`) that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, and `min_k` is the factor that achieves this minimum LCM, otherwise the values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged, and this process continues until `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.**
