The value of `min_lcm` is updated to be equal to the value of `current_lcm`. The states of the other variables are not affected. The conditions that led to this update are still valid: `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is one of `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `min_lcm` is equal to the LCM of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `min_k` retains its initial value, `candidate` is one of `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm`**
