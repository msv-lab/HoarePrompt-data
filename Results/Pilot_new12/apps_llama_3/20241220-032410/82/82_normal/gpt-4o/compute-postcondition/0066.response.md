According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `k` and `diff // k`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a factor of `diff` and is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. The loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`. 

Since `k` is not equal to `diff // k` (because `a` is not equal to `b` and `diff` is greater than 0), for the loop to execute one more time, it must be the case that the first iteration was for `k` and the next iteration should be for `diff // k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is `diff // k`**
