Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is the current minimum positive infinity or a value that has been updated, `min_k` is the current minimum value of 0 or a value that has been updated, `k` is 1, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. The current value of `current_lcm` is less than the current value of `min_lcm`, or the current value of `current_lcm` is equal to the current value of `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than the current value of `min_k`.**
