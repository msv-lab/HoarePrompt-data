Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is either positive infinity or the minimum LCM found so far of `new_a` and `new_b` where `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, `min_k` is either 0 or the `candidate` that resulted in the minimum `min_lcm` found so far, `k` is 1, and `diff` is divisible by `k`. The `min_lcm` and `min_k` are updated if a smaller LCM is found or if the same LCM is found with a smaller `candidate`.***
