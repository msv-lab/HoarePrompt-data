The value of `new_b` is updated to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. Given that `candidate` is `diff // k` and `diff` is `abs(a - b)` and `k` is 2, `candidate` is `abs(a - b) // 2`. Substituting this into the formula for `new_b`, we get `new_b = (b + abs(a - b) // 2 - 1) // (abs(a - b) // 2) * (abs(a - b) // 2)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `k` is 2, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `abs(a - b) / 2` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + abs(a - b) // 2 - 1) // (abs(a - b) // 2) * (abs(a - b) // 2)`, `candidate` is `abs(a - b) // 2`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `k` is 2, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `abs(a - b) / 2` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + abs(a - b) // 2 - 1) // (abs(a - b) // 2) * (abs(a - b) // 2)`, `candidate` is `abs(a - b) // 2`**
