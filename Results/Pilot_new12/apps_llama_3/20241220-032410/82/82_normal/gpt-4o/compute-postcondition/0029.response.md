Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `k` is 2, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `abs(a - b) / 2` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + abs(a - b) // 2 - 1) // (abs(a - b) // 2) * (abs(a - b) // 2)`, `candidate` is `abs(a - b) // 2`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` as calculated by `func_2`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is `abs(a - b) // 2`.**
