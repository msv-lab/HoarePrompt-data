The given code updates the value of `new_b` based on the values of `b` and `candidate`. The expression `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` calculates the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is the other value from the list `[k, diff // k]` that hasn't been evaluated yet, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` and `min_lcm` and `min_k` will be updated according to their respective conditions**.
