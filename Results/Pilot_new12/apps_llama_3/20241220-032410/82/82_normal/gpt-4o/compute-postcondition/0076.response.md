To calculate the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given Python code on the program. The code defines a new variable `current_lcm` and assigns it the result of the function `func_2` applied to `new_a` and `new_b`. Given the initial state and this operation, we can deduce the following:

- `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, and `a` is not equal to `b`. This condition remains unchanged.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, which also remains unchanged.
- `k` is a factor of `diff` and is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. This condition remains unchanged.
- `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, which remains unchanged.
- `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. These values also remain unchanged as they are based on previous calculations and not directly affected by the assignment of `current_lcm`.
- `current_lcm` is assigned the value of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. Since `func_2` is not defined in the problem statement, we assume it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b` based on its name and common mathematical operations. Thus, `current_lcm` will be the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Given these considerations, the output state remains largely the same as the initial state, with the addition of `current_lcm` being the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
