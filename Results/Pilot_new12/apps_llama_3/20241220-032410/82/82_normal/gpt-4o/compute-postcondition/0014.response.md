The variable `min_k` is updated to be equal to `candidate`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`, `k` is 1, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`, `k` is 1, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
