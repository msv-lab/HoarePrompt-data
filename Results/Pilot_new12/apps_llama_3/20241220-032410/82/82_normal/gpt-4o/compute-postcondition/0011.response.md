The code defines a new variable `current_lcm` and assigns it the value returned by the function `func_2` when called with the arguments `new_a` and `new_b`. 

Since `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, and `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, then `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively.

The function `func_2` is not defined in the given code, so we assume it calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Therefore, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, which are the smallest multiples of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`**
