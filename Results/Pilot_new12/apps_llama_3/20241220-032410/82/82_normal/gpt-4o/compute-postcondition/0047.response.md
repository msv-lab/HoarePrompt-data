Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` but `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their original values, with `new_a` being `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` being `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` being the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` as calculated by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.***
