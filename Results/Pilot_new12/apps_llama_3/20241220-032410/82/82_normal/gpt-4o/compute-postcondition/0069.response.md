The value of `current_lcm` is assigned the result of the function `func_2` applied to `new_a` and `new_b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, and `new_b` are not affected, as they are not changed by the code. Since `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, and `candidate` is `diff // k`, then `new_a` and `new_b` are multiples of `candidate` and thus are also multiples of `k` (as `k` is a factor of `diff` and `candidate = diff // k`).

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
