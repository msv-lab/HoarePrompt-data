To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables. The code snippet provided is:

```python
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is at least `k`.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`.
- `k` is at least 2.
- `candidate` is the other value from the list `[k, diff // k]` that hasn't been evaluated yet.
- `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` will be updated according to their respective conditions.

The function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` is not defined in the provided snippet, but based on its name and the context, it seems to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b`. 

The code only updates the value of `current_lcm`. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in `current_lcm` while keeping all other conditions unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is the other value from the list `[k, diff // k]` that hasn't been evaluated yet, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` as calculated by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
