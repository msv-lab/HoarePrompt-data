The value of `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is the other value from the list `[k, diff // k]` that hasn't been evaluated yet, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` as calculated by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.
