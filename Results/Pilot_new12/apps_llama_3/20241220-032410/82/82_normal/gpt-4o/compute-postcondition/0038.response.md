The code `min_lcm = current_lcm` assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` are not affected. 

The value of `min_lcm` is updated to be equal to `current_lcm`. The value of `min_k` remains unchanged, as the code does not modify it. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` remains in its previous state.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` remains in its previous state**
