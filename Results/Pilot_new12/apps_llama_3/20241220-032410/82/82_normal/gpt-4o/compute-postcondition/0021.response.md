The code `min_k = candidate` assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this update. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is the LCM of `(a + 1) // 2 * 2` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `min_k` is `candidate`, `k` is 2, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `(a + 1) // 2 * 2` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
