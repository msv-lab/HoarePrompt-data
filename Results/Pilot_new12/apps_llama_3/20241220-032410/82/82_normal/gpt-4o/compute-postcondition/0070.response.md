The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, `new_b` are not affected by this code, and `current_lcm` has been assigned to `min_lcm`. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`**
