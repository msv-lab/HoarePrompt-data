To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program and calculate the results step by step.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0.
- `k` is a factor of `diff`.
- `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their values.
- `candidate` is one of `k` or `diff // k`.
- `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.
- `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

The code to be executed is:
```python
current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)
```

This line of code calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of `new_a` and `new_b` using a function named `func_2` and assigns this value to `current_lcm`.

After executing this code:
- The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, and `new_b` do not change.
- A new variable `current_lcm` is introduced and assigned the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Therefore, the output state includes all the initial conditions plus the new variable `current_lcm`, which equals the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their values, `candidate` is one of `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
