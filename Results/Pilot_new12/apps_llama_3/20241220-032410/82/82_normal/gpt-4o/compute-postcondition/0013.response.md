To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`.
- `min_lcm` is the current minimum positive infinity or a value that has been updated.
- `min_k` is the current minimum value of 0 or a value that has been updated.
- `k` is 1, and `diff` is divisible by `k`.
- `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`.
- `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`.
- `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
- The current value of `current_lcm` is less than the current value of `min_lcm`, or the current value of `current_lcm` is equal to the current value of `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than the current value of `min_k`.

The code snippet is:
```python
min_lcm = current_lcm
```
This line of code updates the value of `min_lcm` to be equal to `current_lcm`.

Since `min_lcm` is updated to be equal to `current_lcm`, we need to consider the conditions under which this update happens:
- The current value of `current_lcm` is less than the current value of `min_lcm`.
- The current value of `current_lcm` is equal to the current value of `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than the current value of `min_k`.

Given these conditions, we can infer that `min_lcm` will be updated to a value that is either less than its previous value or equal to its previous value if `candidate` is less than `min_k`.

However, since the code only updates `min_lcm` without modifying any other variables, the output state will reflect this change while keeping all other initial state conditions valid.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is the current minimum value of 0 or a value that has been updated, `k` is 1, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
