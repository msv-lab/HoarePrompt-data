The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. The value of `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, which is calculated by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is the other value from the list `[k, diff // k]` that hasn't been evaluated yet, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` as calculated by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`**
