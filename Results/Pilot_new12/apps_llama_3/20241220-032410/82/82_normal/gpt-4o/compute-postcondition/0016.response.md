According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `diff`. The loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is 1 and `diff` is divisible by `k`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased to the next possible value.

Since the loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]`, it will first iterate over `k` and then over `diff // k`. After the first iteration, `k` is 1, so the next iteration will be over `diff // k`. After that, `k` should be increased to 2, so the next iteration can start.

However, the loop will only execute again if `k` is less than or equal to the square root of `diff`, because after that, `diff // k` will be less than `k`, and the same pair of candidates will be repeated in reverse order.

So, for the loop to execute one more time, `k` should be increased by 1, and `diff` should still be divisible by `k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is either positive infinity or the minimum LCM found so far of `new_a` and `new_b` where `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` for `candidate` in `[1, diff]`, `min_k` is either 0 or the `candidate` that resulted in the minimum `min_lcm` found so far, `k` is 2, and `diff` is divisible by `k`.**
