Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their initial values, `candidate` is one of `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. The current value of `current_lcm` is less than the current value of `min_lcm`, or the current value of `current_lcm` is equal to the current value of `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than the current value of `min_k`.**
