The code assigns `candidate` to `min_k`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, and `min_lcm` are not affected by this operation. 

The value of `min_k` is now equal to `candidate`, which is `diff // k`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is equal to `candidate` which is `diff // k`**
