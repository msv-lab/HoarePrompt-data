According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `k` and `diff`. If `diff` is at least 1, the loop can execute, but the upper limit of the loop is determined by the square root of `diff`. Before the loop starts, the state is defined by `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k`. To ensure the loop can execute, `diff` must be greater than 0, and since `diff` is calculated as `abs(a - b)`, this is guaranteed by the condition that `a` is not equal to `b`. The variable `k` starts at 1.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)` and thus greater than 0, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, and `k` is 1**
