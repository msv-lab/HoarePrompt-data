According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list of candidates. The list of candidates is defined as `[k, diff // k]`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute again, the list of candidates must have at least two elements. Since the list of candidates is `[k, diff // k]`, this condition is met if `k` and `diff // k` are not the same. 

If `k` equals `diff // k`, then the list of candidates has only one unique element, and the loop will not execute again. However, if `k` is not equal to `diff // k`, then the loop will execute again with the next candidate in the list.

In the given list of candidates `[k, diff // k]`, the first candidate is `k`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the candidate must be `diff // k`. 

The other variables `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` may or may not change during the loop iteration. However, their current values are not relevant to determining whether the loop will execute again.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2, candidate is `diff // k`**
