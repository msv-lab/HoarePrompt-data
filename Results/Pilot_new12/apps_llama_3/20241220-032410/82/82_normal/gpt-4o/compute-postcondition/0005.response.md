The code introduces a new variable `min_k` and assigns it the value `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9`, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, and `min_k` is 0**
