The code assigns `min_k` the value of `candidate`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, and `min_lcm` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, and `min_k` is `diff // k`.**
