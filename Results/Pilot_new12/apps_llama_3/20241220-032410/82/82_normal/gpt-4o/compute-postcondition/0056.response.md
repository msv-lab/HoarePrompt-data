Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`. If `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `k` is the final value of `k`, `min_lcm` is the smallest LCM found during the iterations, and `min_k` is the corresponding candidate. If the loop does not execute or `diff` is not divisible by `k`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their original values.***
