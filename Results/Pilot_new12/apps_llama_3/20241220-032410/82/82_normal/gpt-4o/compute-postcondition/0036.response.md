The value of `current_lcm` is assigned the result of the function `func_2` applied to `new_a` and `new_b`. The function `func_2` is not specified, but based on its name and the context of `lcm` (least common multiple), it likely calculates the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`. 

Given that `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, both `new_a` and `new_b` are multiples of `candidate`. The states of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, and `new_b` are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are in their initial states, and `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` as calculated by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are in their initial states, and `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
