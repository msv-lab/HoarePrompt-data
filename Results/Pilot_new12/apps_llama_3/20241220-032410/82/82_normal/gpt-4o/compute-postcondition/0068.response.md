The new variable `new_b` is assigned the value of the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`. The values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `candidate`, and `new_a` are not affected by this operation. 

The expression `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` calculates this smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`**
