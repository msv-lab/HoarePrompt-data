The code calculates `new_b` based on `b` and `candidate`. Given that `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_b` becomes `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. This operation effectively rounds `b` up to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` are in their initial states, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`**
