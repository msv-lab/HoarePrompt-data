The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. The value of `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`a` and `b` are still positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. 
`min_lcm` is now equal to the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, which is `current_lcm`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least `k`, `k` is at least 2, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`, and `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, which is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
