Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `k` is 2, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`. Otherwise, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their previous values.**
