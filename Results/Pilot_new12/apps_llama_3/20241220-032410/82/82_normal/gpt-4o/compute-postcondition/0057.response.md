To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for k in range(1, int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`.
- If `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `k` is the final value of `k`, `min_lcm` is the smallest LCM found during the iterations, and `min_k` is the corresponding candidate.
- If the loop does not execute or `diff` is not divisible by `k`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their original values.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Given that `k` ranges from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, for the next iteration to occur, the current value of `k` must be less than `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `k` should be incremented by 1.
- The condition for the loop to continue executing is that `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.

Other states like `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, and `min_k` do not directly influence whether the loop can execute again but are relevant for the operations within the loop body, which is not detailed here.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, `k` is incremented by 1, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their values unless updated within the loop, and `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`**
