Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, if `diff` is divisible by 1, then `min_lcm` is the smallest least common multiple of the rounded up values of `a` and `b` to the nearest multiple of any factor of `diff`, `min_k` is the factor that resulted in the smallest least common multiple, `k` has iterated over all possible factors of `diff`, otherwise the state of `min_lcm` and `min_k` remains unchanged as `min_lcm` is positive infinity and `min_k` is 0***
