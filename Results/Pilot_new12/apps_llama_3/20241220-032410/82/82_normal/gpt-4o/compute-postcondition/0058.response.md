To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and initial states.

Given the for loop:
```python
for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
    # the loop body is omitted
```
The initial states are:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9.
- `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`.
- `k` is incremented by 1.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their values unless updated within the loop.
- `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that the list `[k, diff // k]` is not empty and that `k` and `diff // k` are valid candidates.

Step-by-step analysis:
1. The loop iterates over two candidates: `k` and `diff // k`. For these candidates to be valid, `k` must be a factor of `diff`.
2. Since `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, and both `a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `diff` is also a positive integer.
3. The condition `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))` ensures that `k` is within a reasonable range for the loop to execute.
4. For `diff // k` to be a valid candidate, `diff` must be divisible by `k`, meaning `k` is a factor of `diff`.

To adjust the initial states for the loop to execute:
- `a` and `b` must be positive integers between 1 and 10^9.
- `a` must not be equal to `b` to ensure `diff` is greater than 0.
- `diff` must be the absolute difference between the original values of `a` and `b`, and it must be greater than 0.
- `k` must be incremented by 1 and be a factor of `diff`.
- `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.
- `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their values unless updated within the loop.
- `candidate` will initially be `k`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers between 1 and 10^9, `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and is greater than 0, `k` is a factor of `diff`, `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `min_lcm` and `min_k` retain their values, and `candidate` is one of `k` or `diff // k`**
