`min_lcm` is assigned the value of `current_lcm`. The values of the other variables are not affected, so `a` and `b` are still positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is still `abs(a - b)`, `min_k` is either 0 or the `candidate` resulting in the minimum `min_lcm` before this update, `k` is still 2, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is still `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` is still `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is still the LCM of `(a + 1) // 2 * 2` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that `1 <= a, b <= 10^9` and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is the LCM of `(a + 1) // 2 * 2` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `min_k` is either 0 or the `candidate` resulting in the minimum `min_lcm` before this update, `k` is 2, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` is `(a + 1) // 2 * 2`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `(a + 1) // 2 * 2` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`**
