The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `mex` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is still a sorted list of at least 3 positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `num` is still the third element in the list `a`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of at least 3 positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `num` is the third element in the list `a`, `mex` is increased by 1**
