The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in-place, meaning it modifies the original list. The list `a` contains `n` positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive). 

After sorting, the list `a` will still contain the same `n` positive integers, but they will be in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive)**
