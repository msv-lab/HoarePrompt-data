The code simply prints the value of `mex`. This operation does not change the values of any variables, but it does return/output the value of `mex`, which is the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a` or is greater than the maximum value in `a` if all smaller positive integers are present in `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `num` is the last element in the list `a`, `mex` is the smallest positive integer that is not in the list `a` or is greater than the maximum value in `a` if all smaller positive integers are present in `a`, and `mex` has been returned as output**
