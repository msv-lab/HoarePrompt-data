The code `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. 

Since the initial state specifies that the input is an array of n positive integers, the value of `n` will be the number of integers in the array. 

The value of `n` can be any positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), because the problem statement says that n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100,000.

Output State: **The input is an array of n positive integers, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) such that n = int(input()), and each integer in the array is between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive).**
