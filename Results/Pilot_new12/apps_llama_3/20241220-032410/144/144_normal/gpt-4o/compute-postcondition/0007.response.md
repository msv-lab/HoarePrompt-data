Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) that is not empty, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, if `num` is greater than or equal to 1, then `mex` is 2, otherwise there is no change in the state of the variables.***
