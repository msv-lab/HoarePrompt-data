The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `mex` is 1, so the new value of `mex` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) that is not empty, `mex` is 2, and the current value of `mex` is used to compare with `num`, `num` is the first element in the list `a`, and the current value of `num` is greater than or equal to the previous value of `mex` but its comparison with the new value of `mex` is unknown.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) that is not empty, `mex` is 2, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**
