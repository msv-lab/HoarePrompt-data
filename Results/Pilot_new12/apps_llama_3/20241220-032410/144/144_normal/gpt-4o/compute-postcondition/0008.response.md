To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive).
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) that is not empty.
- `num` is the first element in the list `a`.
- If `num` is greater than or equal to 1, then `mex` is 2, otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

The loop statement is `for num in a:`. This means that in each iteration, `num` takes the value of the next element in the list `a`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` was the first element of `a`.
- Since `a` is sorted and `num` is the first element, for the loop to execute again, `a` must have at least two elements.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `num` needs to be the second element of `a` (since the loop iterates over each element in `a`).
- Since `a` is sorted and we are moving to the second element, `a` must have at least two elements.
- The state of `n` does not change because it represents the total number of elements in `a`, and we're not modifying `a` by adding or removing elements, just iterating over it.
- The condition about `mex` being 2 if `num` is greater than or equal to 1 applies to the current state of `num`. For the next iteration, `num` will take the value of the second element in `a`. If this second element is also greater than or equal to 1 (which is likely given that all elements in `a` are positive integers), then `mex` would still be relevant but its value would depend on the new value of `num`.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `num` is the second element in the list `a`, and if the new `num` is greater than or equal to 1, then `mex` is potentially updated based on the new `num`.**
