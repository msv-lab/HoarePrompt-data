According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `num` is the second element in the list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `a` must have at least 3 elements and `num` is the third element in the list `a`.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of at least 3 positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `num` is the third element in the list `a`**
