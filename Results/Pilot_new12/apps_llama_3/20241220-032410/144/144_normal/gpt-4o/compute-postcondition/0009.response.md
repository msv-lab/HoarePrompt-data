The code increments `mex` by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive). The list `a` remains a sorted list of at least 2 positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), and `num` remains the second element in the list `a`. The new value of `mex` is `mex + 1`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of at least 2 positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `num` is the second element in the list `a`, and `mex` is `mex + 1`.**
