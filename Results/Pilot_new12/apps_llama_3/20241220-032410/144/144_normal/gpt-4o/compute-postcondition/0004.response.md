According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list `a` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive) and `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers, we can conclude that `a` is not empty. Therefore, the loop will execute.

Before the loop starts, `mex` is 1. At the start of the loop, `num` will be the first element in the list `a`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000 (inclusive), `a` is a sorted list of `n` positive integers between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive) that is not empty, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in the list `a`**
