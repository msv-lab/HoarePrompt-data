Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly: It reads an integer `n` and then `n` positive integers, which are stored in the list `a`.
2. The program sorts the list `a` in ascending order, which is necessary to find the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in the array.
3. The program initializes `mex` to 1 and then iterates over the sorted list `a`. If the current number `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1. This effectively finds the smallest positive integer that doesn't appear in the array or is greater than the maximum value in `a` if all smaller positive integers are present in `a`.
4. The program prints the final value of `mex`, which represents the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some (possibly none) operations.

The program works correctly because it takes into account the fact that Alyona can decrease any element of the array to a smaller positive integer. By sorting the array and iterating over it, the program effectively finds the smallest positive integer that doesn't appear in the array, which is the maximum possible value of mex.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* When the array contains all positive integers from 1 to `n`, in which case the maximum possible value of mex is `n+1`.
* When the array contains duplicates, in which case the program ignores the duplicates and finds the smallest positive integer that doesn't appear in the array.
* When the array contains large integers, in which case the program correctly handles them and finds the smallest positive integer that doesn't appear in the array.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and finds the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some (possibly none) operations.
