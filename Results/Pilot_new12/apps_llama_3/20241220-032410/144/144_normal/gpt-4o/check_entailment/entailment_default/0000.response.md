Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to correctly implement the solution to the problem. The problem asks to determine the maximum possible value of MEX (the minimum positive integer that doesn't appear in the array) after Alyona can decrease any element in the array to a smaller positive integer. The code sorts the array in ascending order and then iterates through the sorted array, incrementing the MEX value until it finds a number in the array that is greater than or equal to the current MEX value.

The code correctly handles edge cases such as arrays with duplicate numbers, arrays with numbers greater than the MEX value, and arrays with all numbers from 1 to `n` present. The code also does not modify the original input array beyond sorting it, and the program's state after execution reflects the input array being sorted and the MEX value being printed.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For instance, when given the input `[1, 3, 3, 3, 6]`, the code correctly outputs `5`, which is the maximum possible value of MEX after decreasing some elements in the array. Similarly, when given the input `[2, 1]`, the code correctly outputs `3`.

The output hints provided also agree with the code and do not indicate any issues with the code's logic or handling of edge cases. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, it appears that the code is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
