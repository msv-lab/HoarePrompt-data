Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

The problem requires finding the maximum possible value of the minimum positive integer (MEX) that does not appear in the array after some operations (i.e., decreasing elements) have been applied. The program sorts the array and then iterates through it, incrementing the MEX value until it finds a number in the array that is greater than or equal to the current MEX value. This process ensures that the MEX value is the smallest positive integer that does not appear in the array.

The program handles edge cases correctly, including arrays with duplicate numbers and arrays with numbers greater than the MEX value. The sorting step allows the program to efficiently find the MEX value, and the iteration step ensures that the MEX value is incremented correctly.

For example, in the first sample case, the array [1, 3, 3, 3, 6] is sorted to [1, 3, 3, 3, 6]. The program then iterates through the array, incrementing the MEX value until it finds a number that is greater than or equal to the current MEX value. In this case, the MEX value is incremented to 5, which is the correct maximum possible value of the MEX.

In the second sample case, the array [2, 1] is sorted to [1, 2]. The program then iterates through the array, incrementing the MEX value until it finds a number that is greater than or equal to the current MEX value. In this case, the MEX value is incremented to 3, which is the correct maximum possible value of the MEX.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic required to find the maximum possible value of the MEX, as specified in the problem description.
