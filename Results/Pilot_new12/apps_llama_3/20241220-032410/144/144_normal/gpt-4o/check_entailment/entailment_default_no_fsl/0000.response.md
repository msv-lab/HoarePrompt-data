Correctness: **True**

The code is correct and works as expected for every potential case. It correctly calculates the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some (possibly none) operations.

Here's why:

1. The code first sorts the input array in ascending order. This is done to simplify the process of finding the mex value.

2. It then initializes the mex value to 1, which is the smallest positive integer.

3. The code then iterates through the sorted array. If the current number is greater than or equal to the current mex value, it increments the mex value by 1. This process continues until all numbers in the array have been processed.

4. The final mex value is then printed as output.

The code correctly handles edge cases such as arrays with duplicate numbers, arrays with numbers greater than the mex value, and arrays with all numbers from 1 to `n` present.

For example, if the input array is `[1, 3, 3, 3, 6]`, the code will correctly output `5`, which is the maximum possible value of mex after decreasing some numbers in the array. If the input array is `[2, 1]`, the code will correctly output `3`, which is the maximum possible value of mex without decreasing any numbers in the array.

The code assumes that the input will always be valid (i.e., a list of positive integers), and it handles all possible cases for valid inputs. Therefore, the code is correct.
