Correctness: **False**.

The given code is intended to find the maximum possible value of mex of an array after applying operations (decreasing elements) to the array. However, the provided code simply calculates the smallest positive integer missing from the sorted array.

The issue with the code lies in its inability to consider the optimal strategy for maximizing the mex value. The code does not properly account for cases where decreasing an element to a smaller value would increase the mex value.

For example, consider the input array [2, 2, 2]. The code calculates the mex value as 1 because it only checks for the smallest missing positive integer in the sorted array. However, the optimal strategy would be to decrease one of the 2s to 1, resulting in the array [1, 2, 2], which has a mex value of 3. Therefore, the code does not work correctly for every potential case, particularly when there are duplicate elements that can be decreased to increase the mex value.

To fix this issue, the code needs to consider a strategy that involves decreasing elements to create a contiguous sequence of positive integers, which would maximize the mex value. However, the provided code does not implement this strategy, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
