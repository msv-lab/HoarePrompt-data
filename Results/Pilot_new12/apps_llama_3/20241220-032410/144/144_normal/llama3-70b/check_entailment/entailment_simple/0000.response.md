Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input correctly, taking the number of elements `n` and the array of positive integers `arr`.
2. It sorts the array `arr` in ascending order, which is necessary to find the maximum possible value of mex.
3. The program initializes `mex` to 1, which is the smallest positive integer.
4. It then iterates through the sorted array. If the current number `num` is equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1. This is because if `num` is equal to `mex`, it means that `mex` is present in the array, so we need to find the next smallest positive integer that is not present.
5. If `num` is greater than `mex`, it breaks the loop because any further iterations will not affect the value of `mex`. This is because all numbers greater than `mex` do not affect the mex value of the array.
6. Finally, it prints the value of `mex`, which is the maximum possible value of mex that can be achieved by decreasing some elements of the array.

The program works correctly because it takes into account the fact that Alyona can decrease any element of the array to a smaller positive integer. By sorting the array and iterating through it, the program effectively finds the maximum possible value of mex by "filling in" any gaps in the array.

The time complexity of the program is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation, and the space complexity is O(n) for storing the input array. However, the correctness of the program is not affected by these complexities, as the program still produces the correct output for all valid inputs.
