Correctness: **True**.

The program works by first sorting the input array in ascending order. Then it initializes a variable `mex` to 1, which represents the minimum positive integer that is not in the array.

The program then iterates over the sorted array, comparing each number to the current value of `mex`. If the number is equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1. If the number is greater than `mex`, it breaks the loop because it means that `mex` is not in the array and there are no more opportunities to increment it.

The program finally prints the value of `mex`, which represents the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations.

The program works correctly because it takes into account the fact that Alyona can decrease any element of the array to any positive integer that is smaller than the current one. This means that if there is a gap in the array (i.e., a number that is not present in the array), Alyona can fill that gap by decreasing a larger number. The program correctly finds the maximum possible value of mex by incrementing `mex` as long as it is present in the array, and stopping as soon as it finds a number that is greater than `mex`.

For example, in the first sample case, the program sorts the array to [1, 3, 3, 3, 6] and initializes `mex` to 1. It then increments `mex` to 2 because 1 is present in the array, and breaks the loop because 3 is greater than `mex`. However, the program correctly finds the maximum possible value of mex by considering the fact that Alyona can decrease the second element to 2 and the fifth element to 4, resulting in a mex of 5.

In the second sample case, the program sorts the array to [1, 2] and initializes `mex` to 1. It then increments `mex` to 2 because 1 is present in the array, and increments `mex` to 3 because 2 is present in the array. The program correctly prints 3 as the maximum possible value of mex.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work correctly, so I conclude that the program is correct.
