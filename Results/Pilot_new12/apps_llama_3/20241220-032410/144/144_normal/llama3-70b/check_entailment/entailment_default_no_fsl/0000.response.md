Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly determine the maximum possible value of mex of the array after Alyona applies some operations. 

The issue with the code is that it does not consider the case where Alyona can decrease the values of elements in the array to achieve a higher mex value. The code simply checks if the mex value is present in the array and increments it if it is. However, this approach does not guarantee that the maximum possible mex value is achieved.

For example, consider the input array [1, 3, 3, 3, 6]. The code will output 3, which is incorrect because Alyona can decrease the values of the second and fifth elements to 2 and 4, respectively, resulting in an array with a mex value of 5.

To correctly solve this problem, the code needs to consider all possible ways that Alyona can decrease the values of elements in the array to achieve a higher mex value. This can be done by iterating over all possible mex values and checking if it is possible to achieve that mex value by decreasing the values of elements in the array. 

Here's a correct approach:

1. Sort the array in ascending order.
2. Initialize the mex value to 1.
3. Iterate over the sorted array. For each element, if it is greater than the current mex value, break the loop.
4. If the loop completes without finding an element that is greater than the current mex value, it means that the array does not contain any element that is greater than the current mex value. In this case, the maximum possible mex value is the length of the array plus one.
5. Otherwise, the maximum possible mex value is the smallest index that has an element greater than its index plus one.

Here is a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    used = [0] * (n + 1)
    for num in arr:
        if num <= n:
            used[num] = 1
    mex = 1
    while mex <= n and used[mex]:
        mex += 1
    print(mex)
```
