The given code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into parts, converts each part into an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to the variable `arr`. 

Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive) inputted by the user, it's not directly affected by this line of code. However, the code is attempting to create a list of integers (`arr`) from a new input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a list of integers inputted by the user**
