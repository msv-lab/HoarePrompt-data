The given code is a break statement. This statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. 

The break statement does not change the values of the variables. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
