The `break` statement terminates the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. In this case, since there's no loop or conditional statement provided in the code snippet, we will focus on the initial state and the fact that the `break` statement itself does not alter the values of variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive),
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements,
- `num` is the second element in the list `arr`.

The `break` statement does not modify the values of `n`, `arr`, or `num`. Therefore, after executing the `break` statement, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `arr`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
