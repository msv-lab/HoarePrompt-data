The given code is a `break` statement. This statement is used to terminate the loop or conditional statements that it is a part of. However, in this case, since there is no loop or conditional statement provided in the given code snippet, we can only consider its effect in a general sense.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive)
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element
- `mex` is 1
- The initial value of `num` is the first element in `arr`, which is not equal to `mex` and is greater than `mex`

The `break` statement does not modify any variables directly. It simply exits the nearest loop (if we were inside one) or the nearest conditional block that it's directly part of. Since the code snippet doesn't specify being inside any loop or conditional block that could be exited, we consider the `break` statement's primary effect as ending a block of code it might be part of, which isn't explicitly shown here.

Therefore, the values of `n`, `arr`, `mex`, and `num` remain unchanged by the execution of the `break` statement itself, as `break` does not inherently modify variables or their values. 

The Output State, considering the provided initial state and the effect of the `break` statement (which doesn't alter variable values), is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in `arr` (not equal to `mex` and greater than `mex`), and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
