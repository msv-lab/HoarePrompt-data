The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. Initially, `mex` was 1, so now it becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 2, the current value of `num` is still the first element in `arr` and equals to 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 2, `num` is 1**
