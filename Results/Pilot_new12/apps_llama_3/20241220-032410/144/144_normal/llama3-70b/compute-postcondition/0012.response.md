According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `num` is the first element in the list. 

Since the loop iterates over the elements of `arr`, for the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 2 elements and `num` is the second element in the list.

If `num` is equal to `mex`, then `mex` is 2 and `num` is 1. But `num` is the first element in the list. So if the first element of `arr` is 1, then `mex` is 2.

If `num` is not equal to `mex`, then `mex` remains 1 and since `num` is not equal to `mex`, it implies `num` is greater than `mex`, in this case `mex` is 1.

However since `arr` is a sorted list, if `num` is the first element in `arr` and is greater than 1, it is still possible for the second element to be equal to `mex` which is 1 if it exists.

But if the first element is 1, then `mex` must be 2 for `num` to be equal to `mex` to be false. But we are considering the case when `num` is the first element in `arr` which is equal to 1. So `mex` cannot be 2.

So if `num` is the first element in `arr` which is equal to 1, `mex` must be 1 for `num` not equal to `mex` to be false, otherwise `mex` is 1.

So we conclude, if `arr` has at least two elements, and if the first element of `arr` is 1, `mex` is 1, otherwise, we do not have enough information about `mex`. Since `num` is the first element of the list, for the loop to execute again, `num` must be the second element of the list.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list**
