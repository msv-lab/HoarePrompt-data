The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `mex` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is still a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, and `num` is still the third element in the list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list, and `mex` is increased by 1**
