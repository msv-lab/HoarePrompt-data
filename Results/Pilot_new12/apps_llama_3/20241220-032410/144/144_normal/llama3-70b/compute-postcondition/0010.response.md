Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in `arr` and not equal to `mex`. If `num` is greater than `mex`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, no additional actions are taken when `num` is less than or equal to `mex`, thus the condition `num` > `mex` dictates the only outcome, but `num` is given as not equal to `mex` in the precondition, implying that the num is indeed greater than mex as the else condition is not specified and it was given that `num` is not equal to `mex`.**
