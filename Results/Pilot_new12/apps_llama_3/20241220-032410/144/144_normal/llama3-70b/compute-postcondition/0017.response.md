According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 elements and the `num` is the third element in the list. The value of `n` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop. 
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list**
