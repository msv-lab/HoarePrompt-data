To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers inputted by the user, `mex` is 1.

The loop statement is `for num in arr`, which means the loop will iterate over each element in the `arr` list.

For this loop to execute, the following conditions must be met:
- `arr` must not be empty, as the loop needs elements to iterate over.
- Since `arr` is a sorted list, it implies that the list has at least one element for it to be considered sorted.

Therefore, the adjusted state should ensure that `arr` has at least one element. The value of `n` and `mex` does not directly affect the execution of the loop over `arr`, but their initial state should still be considered as part of the overall program state.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in `arr`**
