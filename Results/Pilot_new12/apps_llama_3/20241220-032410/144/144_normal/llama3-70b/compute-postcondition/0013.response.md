The value of `mex` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `mex` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list, `mex` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list, `mex` is increased by 1**
