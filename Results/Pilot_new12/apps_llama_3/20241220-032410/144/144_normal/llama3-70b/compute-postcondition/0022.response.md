To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the given code and the output states after a few iterations.

The loop iterates over each number `num` in the sorted list `arr`. It checks if `num` is equal to `mex`. If they are equal, `mex` is incremented by 1. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the loop breaks. There's no action specified if `num` is less than `mex`, implying the loop will continue to the next iteration.

Given that `mex` starts at 1 and is incremented only when it matches a number in the list, and the loop breaks as soon as it encounters a number greater than `mex`, `mex` will be the smallest positive integer not present in the list `arr` after the loop finishes.

If the list `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute at all, and `mex` will remain 1 because there are no numbers to compare against.

The output state after the loop executes should reflect the final value of `mex`, which is the smallest positive integer missing from the list `arr`, the unchanged value of `n`, and the fact that `arr` is a sorted list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`.**
