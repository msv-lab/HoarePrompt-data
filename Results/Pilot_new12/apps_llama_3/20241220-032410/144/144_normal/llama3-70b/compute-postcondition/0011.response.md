Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element. If `num` is equal to `mex`, then `mex` is 2 and `num` is 1. If `num` is not equal to `mex`, then `mex` remains 1 and since `num` is not equal to `mex`, it implies `num` is greater than `mex`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
