The code prints the value of `mex`, which is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`. This operation does not change the values of `n`, `arr`, or `mex`. It simply outputs the current value of `mex` to the console. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`, and the value of `mex` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `arr`, and the value of `mex` has been printed.**
