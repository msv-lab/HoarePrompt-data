The input is a list of n positive integers, where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100000, and each integer a_i in the list is such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9. The code snippet `n = int(input())` reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `n`. 

Since we know that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive) and `int(input())` will also be an integer, we can directly use `n` as an integer between 1 and 100000. The list of integers is waiting to be inputted but has not been inputted or processed yet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive) inputted by the user.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive) inputted by the user.**
