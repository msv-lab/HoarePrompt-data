Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list. If `num` equals `mex`, then `mex` is increased by 1. If `num` is greater than `mex`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `num` is less than `mex`, no action is specified.***
