The function calculates the maximum volume that can be stacked by a series of cakes of different sizes, where each cake is defined by its radius and height, and can only be placed on top of a cake with a larger radius and height. The function reads the number of cakes and their dimensions from standard input, calculates the volume of each cake using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, sorts the cakes in descending order of volume, and then uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum volume that can be stacked. The function prints the maximum volume that can be stacked, handling edge cases where there are no cakes (in which case it will print 0) or where cakes cannot be stacked (in which case it will print the volume of the largest cake). The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not handle cases where the input is invalid.
