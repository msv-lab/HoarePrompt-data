#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is provided through standard input where the first line contains an integer n, representing the number of cakes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The following n lines contain two integers r_i and h_i, representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, where 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10 000. The volume of the cake i can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder (πr_i^2h_i).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains the calculated volume (`math.pi * r * r * h`), `r`, and `h` for each cake, or `cakes` is an empty list if `n` is 0
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order, and for each `i`, `dp[i]` is the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and the sum of `cakes[i][0]` and the maximum `dp[j]` value for all `j` less than `i` that satisfy `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the maximum volume that can be stacked by a series of cakes of different sizes, where each cake is defined by its radius and height, and can only be placed on top of a cake with a larger radius and height. The function reads the number of cakes and their dimensions from standard input, calculates the volume of each cake using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, sorts the cakes in descending order of volume, and then uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum volume that can be stacked. The function prints the maximum volume that can be stacked, handling edge cases where there are no cakes (in which case it will print 0) or where cakes cannot be stacked (in which case it will print the volume of the largest cake). The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not handle cases where the input is invalid.
