You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (r, h) = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    print(dp[-1])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. The condition for placing a cake on top of another cake is that the volume of the cake being placed must be strictly greater than the volume of the cake it is being placed on. However, in the code, the condition to place a cake on top of another cake is that both the radius and height of the cake being placed must be less than those of the cake it is being placed on. This is incorrect because it does not consider the volume of the cakes.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input:
3
1 10
1 1
10 1

In this case, the code will not correctly calculate the maximum volume of the cake that can be made. The correct condition for placing a cake on top of another cake should be based on the volume of the cakes, not their radius and height. 

The correct code should compare the volumes of the cakes, not their radii and heights. The correct code should be modified to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach based on the volume of the cakes. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
import math

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (r, h) = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
    cakes.sort()
    dp = [0.0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][0] > cakes[j][0] and cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
    print(max(dp))
```
This code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to find the maximum volume of the cake that can be made by considering the volumes of the cakes.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is provided through standard input where the first line contains an integer n, representing the number of cakes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The following n lines contain two integers r_i and h_i, representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, where 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10 000. The volume of the cake i can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder (πr_i^2h_i).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        
        cakes.append((math.pi * r * r * h, r, h))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains the calculated volume (`math.pi * r * r * h`), `r`, and `h` for each cake, or `cakes` is an empty list if `n` is 0
    cakes.sort(reverse=True)
    dp = [0.0] * n
    dp[0] = cakes[0][0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp[i] = cakes[i][0]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1] and cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order, and for each `i`, `dp[i]` is the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and the sum of `cakes[i][0]` and the maximum `dp[j]` value for all `j` less than `i` that satisfy `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`.
    print(dp[-1])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the maximum volume that can be stacked by a series of cakes of different sizes, where each cake is defined by its radius and height, and can only be placed on top of a cake with a larger radius and height. The function reads the number of cakes and their dimensions from standard input, calculates the volume of each cake using the formula for the volume of a cylinder, sorts the cakes in descending order of volume, and then uses dynamic programming to determine the maximum volume that can be stacked. The function prints the maximum volume that can be stacked, handling edge cases where there are no cakes (in which case it will print 0) or where cakes cannot be stacked (in which case it will print the volume of the largest cake). The function assumes that the input is well-formed and does not handle cases where the input is invalid.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
