The values of `r` and `h` are updated to the input integers. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a list containing a tuple (`math.pi * r * r * h`, `r`, `h`), `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, where `r` and `h` have the new input values.
Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a list containing a tuple (`math.pi * r * r * h`, `r`, `h`), `r` and `h` are the input integers**
