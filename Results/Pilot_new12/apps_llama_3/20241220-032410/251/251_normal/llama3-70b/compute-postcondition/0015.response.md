According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `i`. If `n` is at least 2, the loop can execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer, which means `n` is greater than 0, but we need `n` to be greater than 1 for the loop to execute. `cakes` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order, and `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]` and the rest are zeros (0.0). For the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]` and the rest are zeros (0.0), `i` is 1**
