The value of `dp[i]` is updated to `cakes[i][0]`. Given that `i` is 1, `dp[1]` is assigned the value of `cakes[1][0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order, `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` equals `cakes[1][0]`, and the rest are zeros (0.0), `i` is 1**
