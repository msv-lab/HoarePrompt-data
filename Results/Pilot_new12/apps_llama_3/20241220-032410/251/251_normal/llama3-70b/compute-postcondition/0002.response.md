According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer representing the number of cakes, which is already within the range of 1 to 100,000, and `cakes` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, which is already satisfied by the given condition. 

State: **`n` is an integer and must be greater than 0, `cakes` is an empty list**
