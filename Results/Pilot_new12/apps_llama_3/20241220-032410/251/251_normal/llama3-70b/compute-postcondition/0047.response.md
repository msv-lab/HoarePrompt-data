According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is in the range [2, n]. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. So, `j` becomes 1. 

The other states remain unchanged because they do not depend on the loop variable `j`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `i`, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n+1` tuples in descending order, `i` is in the range [2, n], `j` is 1, if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is `max(cakes[i][0], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])`**
