Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `i`, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n+1` tuples in descending order, `i` is in the range [2, n], `j` is 1, if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to `max(previous dp[i], dp[j] + cakes[i][0])`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged**
