The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The input is an integer representing the number of cakes, such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. The number of cakes `n` is now known and equals the provided input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cakes, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 000, and the next `n` lines of input are expected to contain two integers each, representing the radius and height of each cake.**
