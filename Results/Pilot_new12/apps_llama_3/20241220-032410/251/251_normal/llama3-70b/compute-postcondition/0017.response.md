To determine the necessary state adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(i):`, which means it will iterate over a range from 0 up to, but not including, the value of `i`.

2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `cakes` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order.
   - `dp` is a list where `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` equals `cakes[1][0]`, and the rest are zeros (0.0).
   - `i` is 1.

3. **Conditions for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0 because `range(i)` needs to have at least one element to iterate over. Since `i` is initially 1, this condition is met.

4. **State Adjustments**: Given that `i` is 1, the loop will execute once, with `j` taking the value of 0 during this execution. Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute are inherently met by the initial conditions, except we need to explicitly state the implication of `i` being 1 on the loop variable `j`.

5. **Explicit States**: 
   - `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1.
   - `cakes` remains a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order.
   - `dp` remains as initially described.
   - `i` is 1, which means the loop will only iterate once.
   - `j` will be 0 during the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order, `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` equals `cakes[1][0]`, the rest of `dp` are zeros (0.0), `i` is 1, `j` will be 0 during the loop's execution**
