Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order, `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` equals either `cakes[0][0] + cakes[1][0]` or `cakes[1][0]`, if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[2]` equals the maximum of its initial value and `dp[1] + cakes[2][0]`, otherwise `dp[2]` remains its initial value, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
