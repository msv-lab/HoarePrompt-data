Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `i`, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n+1` tuples in descending order, `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, `i` is in the range [2, n], `j` is 0. The current value of `cakes[i][1]` is less than the current value of `cakes[j][1]` and the current value of `cakes[i][2]` is less than the current value of `cakes[j][2]`**
