According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. However, since `j` is iterating over the range of `i`, and `j` has already reached the last possible value in the range (i.e., `i-1`), for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order, `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[1]` equals `cakes[0][0] + cakes[1][0]`, otherwise `dp[1]` equals `cakes[1][0]`, the rest of `dp` are zeros (0.0), `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
