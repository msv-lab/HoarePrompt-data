To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `cakes` is a sorted list of `n+1` tuples in descending order.
- `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`.
- For each `j` from 1 to `n-1`, `dp[j]` is the maximum of `cakes[j][0]` and the sum of `cakes[j][0]` and the maximum `dp[k]` value for all `k` less than `j` that satisfy `cakes[j][1] < cakes[k][1]` and `cakes[j][2] < cakes[k][2]`.
- If `cakes[n][1] < cakes[0][1]` and `cakes[n][2] < cakes[0][2]`, then `dp[n]` equals `max(cakes[n][0], cakes[0][0] + cakes[n][0])`, otherwise `dp[n]` equals `cakes[n][0]`.
- The current value of `i` is `n`.
- The current value of `j` is 0.

The loop condition is `for j in range(i)`. For this loop to execute one more time, we need to consider what happens when `i` changes, since `j` is directly dependent on the range defined by `i`.

When `i` is `n`, the loop `for j in range(i)` will iterate from 0 to `n-1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must decrease by 1, because the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1`. Thus, if `i` becomes `n-1`, the loop will execute one more time, starting from `j=0` up to `j=n-2`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` must decrease by 1, so `i` becomes `n-1`.
- `j` resets to 0 because it is the starting point of the range defined by `i`.
- The rest of the states (`n`, `cakes`, `dp`) do not need to change for the loop condition itself to be satisfied. However, the nature of `dp` and its calculation might imply further adjustments based on the loop body, but that information is not provided.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n+1` tuples in descending order, `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`, `dp[j]` is the maximum of `cakes[j][0]` and the sum of `cakes[j][0]` and the maximum `dp[k]` value for all `k` less than `j` that satisfy `cakes[j][1] < cakes[k][1]` and `cakes[j][2] < cakes[k][2]`, if `cakes[n][1] < cakes[0][1]` and `cakes[n][2] < cakes[0][2]`, then `dp[n]` equals `max(cakes[n][0], cakes[0][0] + cakes[n][0])`, otherwise `dp[n]` equals `cakes[n][0]`, the current value of `i` is `n-1`, the current value of `j` is 0**
