According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is in the range [2, n], `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `i`, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n+1` tuples in descending order, `i` is in the range [2, n], `j` is 2**
