According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and `i` is `n`, it is guaranteed that `i` is at least 1. For the loop to execute, `j` should be less than `i`, so `j` is less than `n`. At the start of the loop, `j` is 0 because the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n+1` tuples in descending order, `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`, `dp[j]` is the maximum of `cakes[j][0]` and the sum of `cakes[j][0]` and the maximum `dp[k]` value for all `k` less than `j` that satisfy `cakes[j][1] < cakes[k][1]` and `cakes[j][2] < cakes[k][2]`, `dp[n]` equals `cakes[n][0]`, `i` is `n`, `j` is 0**
