According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is not specified but since it's a for loop that starts at 1 and goes up to `n`, we can assume `i` is the current iteration number. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1 and `n` must be greater than the new `i` value. 

So, if `i` was `x` at the end of the last iteration, now `i` should be `x + 1`, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `x + 1`. Since `n` is greater than 1 and `i` ranges from 1 to `n`, at the start of the next iteration `i` will be `x + 1` which is at least 2 and at most `n`. Since `n` must be greater than `i` for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `x + 1` which is at least 3 and at most `n + 1` but since `n` is fixed `n` is still greater than `x + 1` which can be at most `n`. So the adjusted state for `n` is `n` is a positive integer greater than `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `i`, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n+1` tuples in descending order, for each `i`, `dp[i]` is the maximum of `cakes[i][0]` and the sum of `cakes[i][0]` and the maximum `dp[j]` value for all `j` less than `i` that satisfy `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, `i` is in the range [2, n]**
