Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order, `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, `dp[1]` equals `cakes[1][0]`, the rest of `dp` are zeros (0.0), `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the current value of `cakes[i][1]` is less than the current value of `cakes[j][1]`, and the current value of `cakes[i][2]` is less than the current value of `cakes[j][2]`.**
