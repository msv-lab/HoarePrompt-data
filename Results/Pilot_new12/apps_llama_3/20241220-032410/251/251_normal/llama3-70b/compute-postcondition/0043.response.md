According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Given that `i` is in the range [2, n] and `n` is a positive integer greater than `i`, it ensures that `i` is at least 1. However, for the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` must be initialized. 

At the start of the loop, `j` is 0, because the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1`. The state of `cakes` and `dp[i]` does not affect the execution of the loop, but their initial states should be maintained.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than `i`, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n+1` tuples in descending order, `dp[i]` is equal to `cakes[i][0]`, `i` is in the range [2, n], `j` is 0**
