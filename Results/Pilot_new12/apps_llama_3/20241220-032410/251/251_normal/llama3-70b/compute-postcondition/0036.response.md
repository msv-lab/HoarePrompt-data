Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a sorted list of `n+1` tuples in descending order, `dp[0]` equals `cakes[0][0]`, for each `j` from 1 to `n-1`, `dp[j]` is the maximum of `cakes[j][0]` and the sum of `cakes[j][0]` and the maximum `dp[k]` value for all `k` less than `j` that satisfy `cakes[j][1] < cakes[k][1]` and `cakes[j][2] < cakes[k][2]`, if `cakes[n][1] < cakes[0][1]` and `cakes[n][2] < cakes[0][2]`, then `dp[n]` equals `max(cakes[n][0], cakes[0][0] + cakes[n][0])`, otherwise `dp[n]` equals `cakes[n][0]`, if `cakes[i][1] < cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2] < cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[n-1]` equals `max(dp[n-1]` before update, `cakes[0][0] + cakes[n-1][0])`, the current value of `i` is `n-1`, the current value of `j` is 0**
