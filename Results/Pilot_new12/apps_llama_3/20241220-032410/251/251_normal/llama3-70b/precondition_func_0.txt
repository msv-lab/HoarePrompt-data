The input is provided through standard input where the first line contains an integer n, representing the number of cakes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The following n lines contain two integers r_i and h_i, representing the radius and height of the i-th cake, where 1 ≤ r_i, h_i ≤ 10 000. The volume of the cake i can be calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder (πr_i^2h_i).
