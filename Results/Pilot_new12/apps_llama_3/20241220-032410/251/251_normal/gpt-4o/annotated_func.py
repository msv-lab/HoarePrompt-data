    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, and `dp` contains the maximum achievable volumes at each index, considering all previous indices with smaller volumes.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum achievable volume, which is the maximum value in the `dp` list, considering all previous indices with smaller volumes in the list of `n` volumes.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the maximum achievable volume of a list of cakes with varying radii and heights, considering the constraint that a cake can only be stacked on top of another cake if its volume is greater than the volume of the cake below it. The function takes two parameters, a positive integer `n` representing the number of cakes and a list `cakes` of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake. The function returns the maximum achievable volume, which is the maximum value in the list of volumes considering all previous indices with smaller volumes. The function can handle any number of cakes and can calculate the maximum achievable volume for various combinations of cake radii and heights. The function assumes that the input list `cakes` is not empty and that `n` is equal to the length of `cakes`. If the input list is empty or `n` is not equal to the length of `cakes`, the function may not behave as expected.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, and cakes is a list of n tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts parameters n and cakes through user input, where n is a positive integer, and cakes is a list of n tuples, each containing two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake. It then processes this data by calling another function, func_1, with the provided n and cakes, and finally prints the result of func_1 as a floating-point number with six decimal places. The final state of the program includes the printed result, and the input variables n and cakes are stored in memory as part of the function's execution. Note that the function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer or negative inputs, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function's reliance on func_1 implies that the actual calculation or processing of the cakes data is performed outside of this function, and its result is simply printed.
