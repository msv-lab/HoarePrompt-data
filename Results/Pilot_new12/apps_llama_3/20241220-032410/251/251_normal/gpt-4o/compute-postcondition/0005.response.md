The function `func_2` does not seem to accept any parameters, as it is defined with no arguments. However, based on the given parameter constraints, I will assume the function should be defined as follows:


```python
def func_2(n, cakes):
```

The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cakes`. `n` is a positive integer, and `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake. 

Since there are no details about the output of the function, I will wait for further information to provide the full functionality description.


Please provide more details about the output of the function. 


If there are specific return cases (like Case_1, Case_2, etc.), please provide them so I can assist you further.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and cakes, where n is a positive integer, and cakes is a list of n tuples, each containing two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake.**
