According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. So, `j` is now 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 1**
