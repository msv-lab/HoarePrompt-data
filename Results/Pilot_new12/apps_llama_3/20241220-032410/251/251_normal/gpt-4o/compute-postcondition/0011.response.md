According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again because `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be greater than its current value by 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` starts from 0**
