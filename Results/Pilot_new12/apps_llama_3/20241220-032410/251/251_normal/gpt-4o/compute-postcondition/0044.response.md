Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the maximum achievable volume of a list of cakes with varying radii and heights, considering the constraint that a cake can only be stacked on top of another cake if its volume is greater than the volume of the cake below it. The function takes two parameters, a positive integer `n` representing the number of cakes and a list `cakes` of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake. The function returns the maximum achievable volume, which is the maximum value in the list of volumes considering all previous indices with smaller volumes. The function can handle any number of cakes and can calculate the maximum achievable volume for various combinations of cake radii and heights. The function assumes that the input list `cakes` is not empty and that `n` is equal to the length of `cakes`. If the input list is empty or `n` is not equal to the length of `cakes`, the function may not behave as expected.**
