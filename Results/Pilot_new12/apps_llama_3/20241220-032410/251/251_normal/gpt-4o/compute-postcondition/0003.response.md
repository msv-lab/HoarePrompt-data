To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program. The given code snippet calls a function `func_1` with arguments `n` and `cakes`, and assigns the return value to the variable `result`. 

Since the definition of `func_1` is not provided, we can only state that `result` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(n, cakes)`. The previous values of `n`, `cakes`, and `data` are not changed by this code snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is `[(int(data[1]), int(data[2])), (int(data[3]), int(data[4])),..., (int(data[2 * n - 1]), int(data[2 * n]))]`, `data` is a list of input strings, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to `int(data[0])`, `cakes` is `[(int(data[1]), int(data[2])), (int(data[3]), int(data[4])),..., (int(data[2 * n - 1]), int(data[2 * n]))]`, `data` is a list of input strings, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, cakes)`**
