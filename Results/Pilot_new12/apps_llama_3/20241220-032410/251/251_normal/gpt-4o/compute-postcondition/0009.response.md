The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])` updates the value of `dp[i]`. The value of `dp[i]` becomes the maximum of its current value and `dp[j]` plus `volumes[i]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` starts from 0, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j]` plus `volumes[i]`**
