Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 0. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of `volumes[i]` and the sum of `volumes[0]` and `volumes[i]`; otherwise, the state of `dp[i]` remains unchanged as `volumes[i]`.***
