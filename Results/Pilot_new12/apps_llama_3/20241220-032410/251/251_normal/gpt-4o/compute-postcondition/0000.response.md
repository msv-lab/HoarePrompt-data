The code takes an input, splits it into a list of substrings separated by spaces, and assigns this list to the variable `data`. The initial state of `n` and `cakes` is not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake, `data` is a list of input strings**
