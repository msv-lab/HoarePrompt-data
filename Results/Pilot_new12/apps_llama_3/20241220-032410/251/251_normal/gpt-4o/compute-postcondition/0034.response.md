According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 so that `j` can iterate over a new range. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than the current index `i`, increasing `i` by 1 will still be less than `n`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the current index + 1, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, `i` is greater than 1**
