Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, `dp` is a list where each `dp[i]` represents the maximum achievable volume up to index `i` and `dp[i]` is equal to `volumes[i]`, `i` is at least 1 and less than `n`, `j` is 0, and the current value of `volumes[j]` is less than the current value of `volumes[i]`**
