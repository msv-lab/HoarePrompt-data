The `dp` list contains the maximum achievable volumes at each index, considering all previous indices with smaller volumes. Since `dp` is based on the list of `n` volumes and the list of `n` tuples in `cakes`, the maximum value in `dp` would represent the maximum achievable volume considering all previous indices with smaller volumes in the list of `n` volumes.

Output State: **The program returns the maximum achievable volume, which is the maximum value in the `dp` list, considering all previous indices with smaller volumes in the list of `n` volumes.**
