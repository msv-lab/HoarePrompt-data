Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, `dp[0]` equals `volumes[0]`. If there exists a `j` such that `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`.***
