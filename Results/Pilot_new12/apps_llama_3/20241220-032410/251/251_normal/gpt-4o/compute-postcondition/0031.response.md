Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the current index, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, `dp` where each `dp[i]` is the volume at index `i`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` will take values from 0 to `i-1`. The current value of `volumes` at index `j` is less than the current value of `volumes` at index `i`.**
