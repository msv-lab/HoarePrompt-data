Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than the current index, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, `i` is greater than 0. For all `j` less than `i`, if `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`***
