Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, `i` is at least 2 and less than `n`, `j` is 2. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[2] + volumes[i]`. If `volumes[j]` is not less than `volumes[i]`, then no changes are made.***
