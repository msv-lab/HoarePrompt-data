According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` has reached `i-1`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be `i` and `i` must be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cakes` is a list of `n` tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` volumes, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` starts from 0**
