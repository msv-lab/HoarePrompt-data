You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: As you know, every birthday party has a cake! This time, Babaei is going to prepare the very special birthday party's cake.

Simple cake is a cylinder of some radius and height. The volume of the simple cake is equal to the volume of corresponding cylinder. Babaei has n simple cakes and he is going to make a special cake placing some cylinders on each other.

However, there are some additional culinary restrictions. The cakes are numbered in such a way that the cake number i can be placed only on the table or on some cake number j where j < i. Moreover, in order to impress friends Babaei will put the cake i on top of the cake j only if the volume of the cake i is strictly greater than the volume of the cake j.

Babaei wants to prepare a birthday cake that has a maximum possible total volume. Help him find this value.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000) — the number of simple cakes Babaei has.

Each of the following n lines contains two integers r_{i} and h_{i} (1 ≤ r_{i}, h_{i} ≤ 10 000), giving the radius and height of the i-th cake.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum volume of the cake that Babaei can make. Your answer will be considered correct if its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 6}.

Namely: let's assume that your answer is a, and the answer of the jury is b. The checker program will consider your answer correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1, b)} \leq 10^{-6}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
100 30
40 10

Output
942477.796077000

Input
4
1 1
9 7
1 4
10 7

Output
3983.539484752



-----Note-----

In first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1.

In second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2 and 4.
Functions with output description for each function:
import sys
import math

input = sys.stdin.read
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function calculates and returns the maximum achievable volume of a list of cakes with varying radii and heights, considering the constraint that a cake can only be stacked on top of another cake if its volume is greater than the volume of the cake below it. The function takes two parameters, a positive integer `n` representing the number of cakes and a list `cakes` of `n` tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake. The function returns the maximum achievable volume, which is the maximum value in the list of volumes considering all previous indices with smaller volumes. The function can handle any number of cakes and can calculate the maximum achievable volume for various combinations of cake radii and heights. The function assumes that the input list `cakes` is not empty and that `n` is equal to the length of `cakes`. If the input list is empty or `n` is not equal to the length of `cakes`, the function may not behave as expected.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts parameters n and cakes through user input, where n is a positive integer, and cakes is a list of n tuples, each containing two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake. It then processes this data by calling another function, func_1, with the provided n and cakes, and finally prints the result of func_1 as a floating-point number with six decimal places. The final state of the program includes the printed result, and the input variables n and cakes are stored in memory as part of the function's execution. Note that the function does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer or negative inputs, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function's reliance on func_1 implies that the actual calculation or processing of the cakes data is performed outside of this function, and its result is simply printed.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
