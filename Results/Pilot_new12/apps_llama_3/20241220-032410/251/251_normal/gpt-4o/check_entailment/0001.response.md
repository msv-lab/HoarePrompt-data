Correctness: **False**

The issue with the given program lies in the way it reads the input for the cakes' radii and heights. In the `func_2` function, it attempts to parse the input as if all the numbers are provided on the same line, separated by spaces. However, according to the problem description, each cake's radius and height are provided on separate lines. 

For example, given the following input:
```
2
100 30
40 10
```
The program should read the `100 30` and `40 10` as separate lines, but instead, it tries to read all the numbers from a single line which does not match the actual input format provided in the problem description.

To correct this, the program should read each cake's radius and height from separate lines. Here's an example of how it could be corrected:
```python
import sys
import math

# Function 1:
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [math.pi * r * r * h for (r, h) in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
    return max(dp)

# Function 2:
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((r, h))
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')

func_2()
```
This version of the program correctly reads the input for each cake from separate lines.
