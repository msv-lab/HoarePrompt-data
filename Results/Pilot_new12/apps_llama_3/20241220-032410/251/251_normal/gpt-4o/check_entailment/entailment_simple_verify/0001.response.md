Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment does not make sense. The original assessment claims that the program reads the input for the cakes' radii and heights incorrectly, but the annotated version of the code does not support this claim. In fact, the annotated version of the code does not provide any information about how the input is read.

However, after carefully examining the code, I found that the issue with the code is actually in the way it reads the input. The code reads the entire input at once and then tries to parse it, which is not correct according to the problem description. The problem description states that the first line of the input contains a single integer n, and then each of the following n lines contains two integers r_i and h_i.

The correct way to read the input is to read the first line to get the value of n, and then read the next n lines to get the values of r_i and h_i.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate, and the program is indeed incorrect.

The correct implementation of the func_2 function should be:

```python
# Function 2:
def func_2():
    n = int(input())
    cakes = []
    for _ in range(n):
        r, h = map(int, input().split())
        cakes.append((r, h))
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
```

Final: **False**
