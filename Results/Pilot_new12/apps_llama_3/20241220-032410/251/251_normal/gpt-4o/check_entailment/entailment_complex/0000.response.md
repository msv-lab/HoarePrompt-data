Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. It calculates the maximum achievable volume of a list of cakes with varying radii and heights, considering the constraint that a cake can only be stacked on top of another cake if its volume is greater than the volume of the cake below it.

The `func_1` function uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum achievable volume for each cake, considering all previous cakes with smaller volumes. The `func_2` function reads the input data, calls `func_1` with the provided data, and prints the result.

The code annotations agree with the code and provide additional insight into its functionality. The annotations mention that the function can handle any number of cakes and can calculate the maximum achievable volume for various combinations of cake radii and heights.

The examples provided in the problem description also work correctly with the given code. For instance, in the first sample, the optimal way is to choose the cake number 1, which has a volume of 942477.796077, and in the second sample, the way to get the maximum volume is to use cakes with indices 1, 2, and 4, resulting in a volume of 3983.539484752.

Since the code correctly implements the problem description and the examples work as expected, the program is considered correct. 

Note that we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, as stated in the problem description. Therefore, we do not consider cases where the input may be invalid, such as non-integer or negative inputs.
