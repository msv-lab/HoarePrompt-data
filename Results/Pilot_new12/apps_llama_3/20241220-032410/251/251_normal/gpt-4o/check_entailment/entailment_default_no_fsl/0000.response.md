Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to correctly solve the problem of finding the maximum achievable volume of a list of cakes with varying radii and heights, considering the constraint that a cake can only be stacked on top of another cake if its volume is greater than the volume of the cake below it.

The `func_1` function calculates the maximum achievable volume by iterating through the list of cakes and for each cake, it checks all previous cakes with smaller volumes. If a smaller cake is found, the function updates the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking the current cake on top of the smaller cake.

The `func_2` function reads the input data, calls `func_1` with the provided data, and prints the result.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The examples provided in the problem description also match the expected output of the code.

The code does not have any obvious errors or missing logic, and it appears to correctly handle all possible inputs. The assumption that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program is also reasonable.

Therefore, based on the provided code and problem description, the code appears to be correct for every potential case.
