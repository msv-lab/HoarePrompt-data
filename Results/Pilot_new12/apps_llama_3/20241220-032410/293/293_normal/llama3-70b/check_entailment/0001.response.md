Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program seems to correctly solve the problem based on the given description. The algorithm it uses to calculate the number of visited nodes before reaching the exit node is consistent with the rules outlined in the problem.

The key insight here is the way the algorithm handles the movement through the tree based on the command string "LRLRLRLRL...". When a command would lead to a node that has already been visited, it is skipped, and if two consecutive commands are skipped, the player moves back to the parent node. This behavior is implicitly handled by the mathematical relationships used in the program.

The program works by iteratively dividing the target exit node `n` by 2 and adjusting the count of visited nodes `ans` based on whether `n` is even or odd. This process mimics the traversal of the binary tree from the root towards the exit node, taking into account the movement rules and the structure of the tree.

Given the constraints that `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`, the program should handle all possible cases correctly, as it does not rely on any assumptions that would be violated within these bounds. The examples provided in the problem statement also support the correctness of the program, as the outputs match the expected results for the given inputs.

Without being able to find a counterexample where the program fails to produce the correct output according to the problem description, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
