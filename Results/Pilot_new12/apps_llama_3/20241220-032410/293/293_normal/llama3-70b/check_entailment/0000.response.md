Correctness: **True**.

The provided program appears to correctly calculate the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit node in a perfect binary tree of height h, following the specified algorithm. 

The program works by iteratively dividing the target node number n by 2 and adding the number of nodes that would be visited at each level. If n is even, it means the exit node is on the right side of the tree at the current level, so the program adds n // 2 - 1 to the answer (since the left child of the current node has been visited before moving to the right child). If n is odd, it means the exit node is on the left side, so the program adds n // 2 to the answer (since no nodes have been skipped at the current level).

The while loop continues until n becomes 1, which means the algorithm has reached the root node of the tree. At this point, the program has correctly calculated the total number of nodes visited before reaching the exit node.

The given examples also validate the correctness of the program. For instance, when h = 1 and n = 2, the program correctly outputs 2, and when h = 2 and n = 3, it correctly outputs 5. 

Without being able to find any case where the program does not work as expected, the program is considered correct.
