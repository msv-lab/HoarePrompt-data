To determine the output state after the loop has finished executing, we need to analyze the given code and the output states after the loop executes some number of times.

The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than 1. In each iteration, `n` is divided by 2, and `ans` is updated based on whether `n` is even or odd.

After the loop finishes executing, `n` will be 1, because the loop condition is `n > 1`, and `n` is divided by 2 in each iteration.

Now, let's analyze the update of `ans`. If `n` is even, `ans` is incremented by `n // 2 - 1`. If `n` is odd, `ans` is incremented by `n // 2`.

We can observe that `ans` is calculated based on the binary representation of the original value of `n`. The number of iterations is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n` minus 1 (because `n` starts at 1 after the first division).

After the loop finishes executing, `ans` will be the sum of the increments calculated in each iteration. This sum can be expressed as the sum of the integer divisions of `n` by powers of 2, minus the number of times `n` is even in the iterations.

Since `n` is divided by 2 in each iteration, the value of `n` after the loop finishes executing will be 1.

Therefore, the output state after the loop has finished executing is:

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is 1, and `ans` is the sum of the increments calculated based on the original value of `n`, which is the sum of the integer divisions of the original `n` by powers of 2, minus the number of times the original `n` is even in the iterations.**
