The code `n //= 2` updates the value of `n` by performing integer division by 2. Given the initial state, `h` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, and `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2^(h-2). After the update, `n` becomes `n // 2`. 

The condition for `ans` depends on the original parity of `n` and the current parity of `n`. Since `n` is updated to `n // 2`, we need to consider how this update affects the parity of `n`. 

If the original `n` is even, `n // 2` will also be even if `n` is divisible by 4, and odd if `n` is not divisible by 4. 
If the original `n` is odd, `n // 2` will always be integer division, resulting in an integer (since this is integer division), and this result will always be rounded down, hence it will always be the integer part of `(n-1)/2`, and hence it will be even if `n` equals 2*k +1 where k is an integer and (2*k +1) mod 4 equals 1 or 3 (i.e., `n` mod 4 equals 1 or 3), and will be odd if `n` equals 2*k +1 and (2*k +1) mod 4 equals 2*k +1 mod 4 which is not possible since 2*k +1 mod 4 can be 1 or 3.

However, given that we just need to consider the new value `n // 2` in place of `n`, and that `ans` depends on the original parity of `n`, which does not change, we get:
- if the original `n` is even: 
    - if the new `n` (`n // 2`) is even, `ans` is `n // 2 - 1 + n // 4 - 1` 
    - if the new `n` (`n // 2`) is odd, `ans` is `(n // 2 - 1) + n // 4` 
- if the original `n` is odd: 
    - if the new `n` (`n // 2`) is even, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + n // 4 - 1` 
    - if the new `n` (`n // 2`) is odd, `ans` is `((n - 1) // 2) + n // 4` 

Given the integer division by 2, the parity of the new `n` (`n // 2`) is determined by whether `n` is divisible by 4 or not (for even `n`), and for odd `n`, `n // 2` is always even (integer division of odd number by 2, i.e., (2*k+1)/2 gives k which is an integer and hence is even).

The value of `h` remains an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, and `n` is updated to `n // 2`, which means it is now an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2^(h-3) (since the maximum value of `n` before the update was 2^(h-2)).

The states of `h` and the conditions determining `ans` remain the same, but `n` is updated. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2^(h-3), and `ans` is updated based on the original parity of `n`: if the original `n` is even, `ans` is `n // 2 - 1 + n // 4 - 1` if the current `n` is even, or `(n // 2 - 1) + n // 4` if the current `n` is odd; if the original `n` is odd, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + n // 4 - 1` if the current `n` is even, or `((n - 1) // 2) + n // 4` if the current `n` is odd, where `n` refers to the updated value `n // 2`.
Output State: **`h` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 2^(h-3), and `ans` is updated based on the original parity of `n`: if the original `n` is even, `ans` is `n // 2 - 1 + n // 4 - 1` if the current `n` is even, or `(n // 2 - 1) + n // 4` if the current `n` is odd; if the original `n` is odd, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + n // 4 - 1` if the current `n` is even, or `((n - 1) // 2) + n // 4` if the current `n` is odd, where `n` refers to the updated value `n // 2`.**
