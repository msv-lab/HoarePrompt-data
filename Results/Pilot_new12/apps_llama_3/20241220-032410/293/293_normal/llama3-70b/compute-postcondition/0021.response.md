The function `func` accepts two parameters `h` and `n`. `h` and `n` are integers where `h` is between 1 and 50 (inclusive) and `n` is between 1 and 2 to the power of `h` (inclusive). However, the provided output information is empty. Given the typical structure of such problems and without specific output details, I can only describe the input parameters.


Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters h and n, where h and n are integers, 1 ≤ h ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h.**
