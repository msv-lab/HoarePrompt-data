To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `h` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` is greater than 2.
- `ans` is updated based on the original parity of `n`. If `n` is even, `ans` equals its original value plus `n // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `ans` equals its original value plus `n // 2`.

The code provided is `n //= 2`, which means `n` is divided by 2 and the result is assigned back to `n`. This operation effectively halves the value of `n` and discards any remainder, since it's an integer division.

After executing `n //= 2`, the value of `n` will be half of its original value. Since `n` was greater than 2, after division by 2, `n` will be greater than 1.

The values of `h` and `ans` are not directly affected by the operation `n //= 2`. However, it's essential to note that the update of `ans` mentioned in the initial state has already occurred based on the original parity of `n`, and the current operation does not change `ans` or `h`.

Thus, after the execution, the state of the variables is as follows:
- `h` is still an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` is now greater than 1, as it has been halved from its original value greater than 2.
- The parity of the original `n` has already determined the update to `ans`, which does not change with the new value of `n`. However, since `n` has changed, if we were to consider the update rule for `ans` based on the new `n`, it would be according to the parity of this new `n`. But based on the provided initial state, `ans` has already been updated according to the original `n`, and no further update rule is applied based on the new value of `n`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` retains its updated value based on the original parity of `n`.**
