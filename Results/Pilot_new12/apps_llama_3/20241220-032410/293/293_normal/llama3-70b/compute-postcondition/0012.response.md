Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2^(h-2), and `ans` is updated based on the original parity of `n`: if the original `n` is even, `ans` is `n // 2 - 1 + n // 4 - 1` if the current `n` is even, or `(n // 2 - 1) + n // 4` if the current `n` is odd; if the original `n` is odd, `ans` is `(n - 1) // 2 + n // 4 - 1` if the current `n` is even, or `((n - 1) // 2) + n // 4` if the current `n` is odd, where `n` refers to the updated value `n // 2`.***
