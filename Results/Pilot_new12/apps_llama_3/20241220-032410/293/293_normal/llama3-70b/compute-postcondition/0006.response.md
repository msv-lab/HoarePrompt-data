The value of `ans` is updated by adding `n // 2` to it. Since `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be the integer part of `n` divided by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given that `n` is odd, we can express `n` as `n = 2k + 1`, where `k` is an integer. Therefore, `n // 2` would be equal to `k`.

So, the new value of `ans` will be `0 + k`, which simplifies to `k`. Since `n = 2k + 1`, we can also express `k` as `k = (n - 1) // 2` or simply `(n - 1) / 2` because `n` is odd and the division of an odd number minus one by 2 will always yield an integer.

Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2^h, `ans` is `(n - 1) / 2` or `n // 2`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an odd integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2^h, `ans` is `(n - 1) / 2` or `n // 2`.**
