The code `ans += n // 2` updates the value of `ans` by adding the integer division of `n` by 2 to it. 

Given that `n` must be greater than 2 and `h` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, the integer division `n // 2` will result in the largest integer less than or equal to `n/2`. 

Since `ans` is updated based on the original parity of `n` and considering the integer division `n // 2`, the new value of `ans` will be the old value of `ans` plus `n // 2`. The parity of `n` (whether `n` is even or odd) affects the integer division `n // 2`, but the exact impact depends on the specific value of `n`. If `n` is even, `n // 2` will be exactly half of `n`. If `n` is odd, `n // 2` will be the integer part of `n/2`, effectively rounding down.

Therefore, considering the initial conditions and the code's effect, the output state is: `h` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is greater than 2, and `ans` is updated to its original value plus `n // 2`, where `n // 2` represents the integer division of `n` by 2.

Output State: **`h` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is greater than 2, and `ans` equals its original value plus `n // 2**
