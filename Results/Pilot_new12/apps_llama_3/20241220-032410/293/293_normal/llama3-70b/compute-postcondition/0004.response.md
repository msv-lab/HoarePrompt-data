To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive).
2. `n` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2^h.
3. The current value of `n` is even.
4. `ans` is 0.

The code to execute is:
```python
ans += n // 2 - 1
```

Given that `n` is even, `n // 2` will be an integer (since integer division in Python rounds down to the nearest whole number). 

Let's break down the operation:

- `n // 2` calculates the integer part of `n` divided by 2.
- Subtracting 1 from this result gives `n // 2 - 1`.
- This result is then added to `ans`.

So, `ans` becomes `ans + (n // 2 - 1)`, which simplifies to `ans + n // 2 - 1`. Given `ans` was initially 0, this further simplifies to `n // 2 - 1`.

The states of `h` and `n` do not change because of this operation. The only change is in `ans`, which now holds the value `n // 2 - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an even integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2^h, and `ans` is `n // 2 - 1`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an even integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 2^h, and `ans` is `n // 2 - 1`.**
