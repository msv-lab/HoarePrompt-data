The code maps the input into two integers, `h` and `n`, using the `map` function in combination with `int` and `input().split()`. This means `h` and `n` are now assigned the values of the two integers provided as input.

Given the initial state that `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`, and considering the code, the output state will reflect the values assigned to `h` and `n` from the input.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^h (inclusive), where `h` and `n` are the values provided by the user input, split into two integers.**
