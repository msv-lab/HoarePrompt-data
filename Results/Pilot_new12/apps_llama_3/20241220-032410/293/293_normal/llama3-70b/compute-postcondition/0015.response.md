To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `h` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` must be greater than 2, and `ans` is updated based on the original parity of `n`.

The code is: `ans += n // 2 - 1`.

Here, `n // 2` calculates the integer division of `n` by 2, which returns the largest whole number less than or equal to the result of the division. The `- 1` then subtracts 1 from this result.

Since `n` is greater than 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1 (when `n` is 2 or 3), and `n // 2 - 1` will be at least 0.

However, because the initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 2, the smallest value for `n` is 3, making `n // 2 - 1 = 0` (for `n = 3` or `n = 4`), but for any `n > 4`, `n // 2 - 1` will be greater than 0.

Given that `ans` is updated based on the original parity of `n`, but the specific update rule before this line is not provided, we can only consider the effect of `ans += n // 2 - 1`. This line increments `ans` by the result of `n // 2 - 1`, which means `ans` will increase by a non-negative integer value that depends on `n`.

Thus, the output state, considering all information:

- `h` remains an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50.
- `n` remains greater than 2.
- `ans` is updated to `ans + n // 2 - 1`, which means its new value depends on its previous value and the current value of `n`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer greater than 1 and less than or equal to 50, `n` is greater than 2, and `ans` is equal to its original value plus `n // 2 - 1`.**
