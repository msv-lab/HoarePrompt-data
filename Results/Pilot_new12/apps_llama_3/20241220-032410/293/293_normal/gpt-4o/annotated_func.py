#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but it is implied that there are two integers h and n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}) that are used to calculate the number of nodes Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit in a perfect binary tree of height h.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    h, n = map(int, input().split())
    total_leaves = 2 ** h
    visited_count = 0
    path = bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)
    current_level = 0
    current_node = 0
    for direction in path:
        visited_count += 1
        
        if direction == '0':
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 1
        else:
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` equals `h`, `current_level` is 0, `path` is the binary string representation of `n-1` padded with zeros to a length of `h` bits, `current_node` equals `n`.
    print(visited_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the number of nodes to visit before reaching the exit in a perfect binary tree of height `h`, where `h` and the target node `n` are input parameters. The function accepts two integers `h` and `n` (1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`) as input from the standard input, calculates the binary path to the target node `n`, and then prints the total number of nodes visited, which is equal to the height `h` of the tree. After execution, the state of the program is such that it has printed the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit, and all variables (including `h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `current_level`, `path`, and `current_node`) are determined based on the input values. Note that the function does not handle cases where the input values of `h` and `n` are outside the specified ranges, which could potentially lead to incorrect results or errors. Additionally, the function does not provide any explicit error handling or input validation.
