Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately simulate Amr's algorithm for finding the exit in the perfect binary tree. It simply calculates the binary path to the target node `n` and prints the height `h` of the tree, which is not equivalent to the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit.

The problem description states that Amr follows a specific algorithm, where he executes characters from the infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL...", and the program does not account for this. The program also does not handle cases where Amr skips two consecutive commands and goes back to the parent node, or when he reaches a leaf node that is not the exit and returns to the parent node.

To correctly solve the problem, the program should simulate Amr's algorithm step by step, taking into account the rules for executing commands, skipping commands, and moving back to the parent node. The provided code does not do this and therefore does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

For example, if we consider the input `2 3`, the correct output should be `5` because Amr will visit the root node, the left child of the root, the right child of the root, the left child of the right child of the root, and the right child of the right child of the root before reaching the exit. However, the provided code simply prints `2`, which is the height of the tree, not the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit.
