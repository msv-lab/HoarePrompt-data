Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem description. The problem description states that Amr follows a simple algorithm to choose the path, which involves sequentially executing the characters of the string "LRLRLRLRL..." using specific rules. However, the provided program does not implement this algorithm.

Instead, the program calculates the binary path to the target node `n` and then prints the height `h` of the tree, which is not equivalent to the algorithm described in the problem description. The program does not take into account the rules for skipping commands, going back to the parent node, or returning to the parent node if a leaf node is not the exit.

To correctly implement the algorithm, the program should simulate the execution of the string "LRLRLRLRL..." and count the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit, taking into account the specific rules described in the problem description. The provided program does not do this, and therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

For example, if the input is `h = 1` and `n = 2`, the program will output `1`, but the correct output should be `2` because Amr will visit the root node and then the right child node (which is the exit). The program does not correctly simulate the algorithm, and therefore, it produces an incorrect result.
