You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out!". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2

Output
2
Input
2 3

Output

Input
3 6

Output
10
Input
10 1024

Output
2046


-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    total_leaves = 2 ** h
    visited_count = 0
    path = bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)
    current_level = 0
    current_node = 0
    for direction in path:
        visited_count += 1
        if direction == '0':
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 1
        else:
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
    print(visited_count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not correctly implement the algorithm described in the problem. The problem describes an algorithm where Amr moves through the tree based on a sequence of 'L's and 'R's, skipping commands if the destination node has already been visited, moving back to the parent node if two consecutive commands are skipped, and returning to the parent node if a leaf node that is not the exit is reached. However, the provided program simply calculates the path to the exit node without considering these rules.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the exit node is not the first leaf node at a given level. In this case, Amr would need to visit nodes that are not on the path to the exit, including nodes that have already been visited, and move back to the parent node if necessary. The provided program does not account for these additional visits.

For example, if we consider a tree of height 2 with 4 leaf nodes, and the exit node is the third leaf node, the program would simply calculate the path to the exit node as '10', resulting in a visited count of 2. However, the correct algorithm would involve visiting additional nodes, resulting in a higher visited count. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function calculates and prints the number of nodes to visit before reaching the exit in a perfect binary tree of height `h`, where `h` and the target node `n` are input parameters. The function accepts two integers `h` and `n` (1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`) as input from the standard input, calculates the binary path to the target node `n`, and then prints the total number of nodes visited, which is equal to the height `h` of the tree. After execution, the state of the program is such that it has printed the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit, and all variables (including `h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `current_level`, `path`, and `current_node`) are determined based on the input values. Note that the function does not handle cases where the input values of `h` and `n` are outside the specified ranges, which could potentially lead to incorrect results or errors. Additionally, the function does not provide any explicit error handling or input validation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
