Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements in the problem description. The problem asks for the number of nodes Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit in a perfect binary tree of height h, excluding the exit node. However, the program only calculates the number of nodes on the path from the root to the exit, which is equal to the height of the tree (h).

The problem description provides an algorithm for Amr to follow, which involves executing characters from the string "LRLRLRLRL..." and skipping commands if they lead to a node that has already been visited. The program does not implement this algorithm correctly.

For example, if the input is h = 2 and n = 3, the program will return 2, which is the number of nodes on the path from the root to the exit. However, according to the problem description, Amr will visit the following nodes in the order: root, left child, right child, left grandchild, right grandchild (exit). Therefore, the correct answer is 5.

To fix this, the program would need to implement the algorithm described in the problem description, which would involve simulating Amr's movements through the tree and counting the number of nodes visited. The provided program only calculates the path length from the root to the exit, which is not sufficient to solve the problem. 

Here is a revised version of the code that implements the algorithm correctly:
```python
import sys

def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    h, n = map(int, input().split())
    visited_count = 0
    current_node = 1
    command_index = 0
    visited_nodes = set()

    while True:
        command = "LR"[command_index % 2]
        command_index += 1

        if command == 'L':
            next_node = current_node * 2
        else:
            next_node = current_node * 2 + 1

        if next_node > 2**h:
            # Reach a leaf node, go back to the parent
            current_node = current_node // 2
            continue

        if next_node in visited_nodes:
            # Skip the command if the destination node is already visited
            if command_index % 2 == 1:
                # If two consecutive commands are skipped, go back to the parent
                current_node = current_node // 2
            continue

        visited_nodes.add(next_node)
        visited_count += 1
        current_node = next_node

        if next_node == n:
            # Reach the exit, stop the simulation
            break

    print(visited_count)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()
```
