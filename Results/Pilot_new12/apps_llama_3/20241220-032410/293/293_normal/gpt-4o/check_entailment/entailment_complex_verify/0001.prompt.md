You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Amr bought a new video game "Guess Your Way Out!". The goal of the game is to find an exit from the maze that looks like a perfect binary tree of height h. The player is initially standing at the root of the tree and the exit from the tree is located at some leaf node. 

Let's index all the leaf nodes from the left to the right from 1 to 2^{h}. The exit is located at some node n where 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}, the player doesn't know where the exit is so he has to guess his way out!

Amr follows simple algorithm to choose the path. Let's consider infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL..." (consisting of alternating characters 'L' and 'R'). Amr sequentially executes the characters of the string using following rules:  Character 'L' means "go to the left child of the current node";  Character 'R' means "go to the right child of the current node";  If the destination node is already visited, Amr skips current command, otherwise he moves to the destination node;  If Amr skipped two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent of the current node before executing next command;  If he reached a leaf node that is not the exit, he returns to the parent of the current node;  If he reaches an exit, the game is finished. 

Now Amr wonders, if he follows this algorithm, how many nodes he is going to visit before reaching the exit?


-----Input-----

Input consists of two integers h, n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}).


-----Output-----

Output a single integer representing the number of nodes (excluding the exit node) Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit by following this algorithm.


-----Examples-----
Input
1 2

Output
2
Input
2 3

Output
5
Input
3 6

Output
10
Input
10 1024

Output
2046


-----Note-----

A perfect binary tree of height h is a binary tree consisting of h + 1 levels. Level 0 consists of a single node called root, level h consists of 2^{h} nodes called leaves. Each node that is not a leaf has exactly two children, left and right one. 

Following picture illustrates the sample test number 3. Nodes are labeled according to the order of visit.

Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    (h, n) = map(int, input().split())
    total_leaves = 2 ** h
    visited_count = 0
    path = bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)
    current_level = 0
    current_node = 0
    for direction in path:
        visited_count += 1
        if direction == '0':
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 1
        else:
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
    print(visited_count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Amr follows a specific algorithm to choose the path, which involves sequentially executing characters from an infinite command string "LRLRLRLRL...". However, the provided program does not implement this algorithm correctly.

The program simply calculates the binary representation of the exit node's index and uses it to traverse the tree. This approach does not account for the rules specified in the problem description, such as skipping commands when the destination node is already visited, going back to the parent node when two consecutive commands are skipped, and returning to the parent node when a non-exit leaf node is reached.

For example, consider the case where h = 2 and n = 3. The program outputs 3, but according to the problem description, Amr should visit nodes in the following order: root, left child, right child, root, right child, left child, right child (exit). The correct output should be 5, not 3.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should be modified to implement the specified algorithm and account for all the rules mentioned in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_1()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no arguments, but it is implied that there are two integers h and n (1 ≤ h ≤ 50, 1 ≤ n ≤ 2^{h}) that are used to calculate the number of nodes Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit in a perfect binary tree of height h.
def func_1():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    h, n = map(int, input().split())
    total_leaves = 2 ** h
    visited_count = 0
    path = bin(n - 1)[2:].zfill(h)
    current_level = 0
    current_node = 0
    for direction in path:
        visited_count += 1
        
        if direction == '0':
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 1
        else:
            current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` equals `h`, `current_level` is 0, `path` is the binary string representation of `n-1` padded with zeros to a length of `h` bits, `current_node` equals `n`.
    print(visited_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and prints the number of nodes to visit before reaching the exit in a perfect binary tree of height `h`, where `h` and the target node `n` are input parameters. The function accepts two integers `h` and `n` (1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`) as input from the standard input, calculates the binary path to the target node `n`, and then prints the total number of nodes visited, which is equal to the height `h` of the tree. After execution, the state of the program is such that it has printed the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit, and all variables (including `h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `current_level`, `path`, and `current_node`) are determined based on the input values. Note that the function does not handle cases where the input values of `h` and `n` are outside the specified ranges, which could potentially lead to incorrect results or errors. Additionally, the function does not provide any explicit error handling or input validation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
