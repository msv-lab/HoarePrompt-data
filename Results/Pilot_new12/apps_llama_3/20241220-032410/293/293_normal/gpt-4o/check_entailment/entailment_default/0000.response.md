Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not accurately implement the algorithm described in the problem. The problem describes Amr navigating a binary tree by following a sequence of 'L' and 'R' commands, where 'L' means go to the left child and 'R' means go to the right child. If Amr reaches a node that has already been visited, he skips the command. If he skips two consecutive commands, he goes back to the parent node.

However, the code simply calculates the binary path to the target node `n` and prints the number of nodes in this path, which is equal to the height `h` of the tree. This does not take into account the fact that Amr may visit the same node multiple times or go back to the parent node if he skips two consecutive commands.

For example, consider the case where `h = 2` and `n = 3`. The correct output should be `5`, but the code will output `2` because it only considers the number of nodes in the binary path to the target node.

To correctly implement the algorithm, the code should simulate Amr's navigation through the tree, keeping track of the current node and the number of nodes visited, and handling the cases where Amr reaches a node that has already been visited or skips two consecutive commands. 

The provided code does not handle these cases correctly and therefore does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
