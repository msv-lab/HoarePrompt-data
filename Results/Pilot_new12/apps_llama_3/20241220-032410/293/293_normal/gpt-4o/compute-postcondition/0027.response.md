Functionality: **The function calculates and prints the number of nodes to visit before reaching the exit in a perfect binary tree of height `h`, where `h` and the target node `n` are input parameters. The function accepts two integers `h` and `n` (1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`) as input from the standard input, calculates the binary path to the target node `n`, and then prints the total number of nodes visited, which is equal to the height `h` of the tree. After execution, the state of the program is such that it has printed the number of nodes visited before reaching the exit, and all variables (including `h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `current_level`, `path`, and `current_node`) are determined based on the input values. Note that the function does not handle cases where the input values of `h` and `n` are outside the specified ranges, which could potentially lead to incorrect results or errors. Additionally, the function does not provide any explicit error handling or input validation.**
