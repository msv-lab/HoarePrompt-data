The code line calculates the value of `total_leaves` as 2 raised to the power of `h`, where `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive). Given that `h` equals the first integer from the input and `n` equals the second integer from the input, and considering the constraints 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50 and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, the variable `total_leaves` is now equal to 2^`h`. 

The states of `h` and `n` are not affected by the code. Therefore, `h` remains an integer equal to the first integer from the input, and `n` remains an integer equal to the second integer from the input, with `n` being within the range 1 to 2^`h`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, where 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, and `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`**
