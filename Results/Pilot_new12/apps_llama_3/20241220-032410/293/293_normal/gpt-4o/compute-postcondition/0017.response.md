The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` updates the value of `current_node`. Given the initial state, `current_node` is either `2 * 1` (if the next `direction` in `path` is '0') or `2 * 2` (if the next `direction` in `path` is '1'). 

Let's calculate the new value of `current_node` in both cases:
- If `current_node` is `2 * 1`, then the new value of `current_node` is `2 * (2 * 1) + 2 = 4 + 2 = 6`.
- If `current_node` is `2 * 2`, then the new value of `current_node` is `2 * (2 * 2) + 2 = 8 + 2 = 10`.

However, these specific calculations assume `current_node` is initially set to either `2` (for '0') or `4` (for '1'), which doesn't align with the given initial conditions that directly describe `current_node` based on the next direction in `path`. Given `current_node` equals `2 * 1` if the direction is '0' and `2 * 2` if the direction is '1', we need to directly apply the formula to these possible initial values of `current_node`.

Thus, `current_node` becomes `2 * current_node + 2`. If the next direction in `path` is '0', making `current_node` initially `2`, it becomes `2 * 2 + 2 = 6`. If the next direction is '1', making `current_node` initially `4`, it becomes `2 * 4 + 2 = 10`.

The other variables (`h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, `current_level`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by the given code.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character, `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is either 6 if the next direction in `path` is '0', otherwise it is 10**.
