The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 2` updates the value of `current_node`. Initially, if the next `direction` in `path` is '0', then `current_node` is 5, otherwise `current_node` is 10.

Let's calculate the new value of `current_node` for both cases:

- If the next `direction` in `path` is '0', then the initial `current_node` is 5. So, `current_node` becomes `2 * 5 + 2 = 12`.
- If the next `direction` in `path` is not '0', then the initial `current_node` is 10. So, `current_node` becomes `2 * 10 + 2 = 22`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty binary string with at least two characters, `current_level` is 1, and `current_node` is either 12 if the next `direction` in `path` is '0', otherwise it is 22.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty binary string with at least two characters, `current_level` is 1, if the next `direction` in `path` is '0', then `current_node` is 12, otherwise `current_node` is 22**
