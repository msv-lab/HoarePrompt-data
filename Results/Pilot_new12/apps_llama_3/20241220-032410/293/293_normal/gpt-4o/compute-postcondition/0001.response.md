The code `h, n = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `h` and `n` by reading two integers from standard input, splitting them, and then assigning them to `h` and `n`, respectively. 

The range of `h` and `n` is still limited by the condition (1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`), but the actual values of `h` and `n` are now determined by the input.

Output State: **`h` and `n` are integers, where `h` equals the first integer from the input and `n` equals the second integer from the input, and the function still takes no arguments, 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, and 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h` if the input is within the specified range**
