The value of `visited_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `visited_count` is 3, so the new value of `visited_count` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty binary string with at least two characters, `current_level` is 1, if the next `direction` in `path` is '0', then `current_node` is 5, otherwise `current_node` is 10.
