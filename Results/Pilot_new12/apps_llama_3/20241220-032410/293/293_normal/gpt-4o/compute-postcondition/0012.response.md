To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and its impact on the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `h` is an integer between 1 and 50
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`
- `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`
- `visited_count` is 1
- `path` is a non-empty binary string
- `current_level` is 0
- `current_node` is 0
- `direction` is the first character of `path`, and the direction is '1'

The code is:
```python
current_node = 2 * current_node + 2
```

Let's calculate the new value of `current_node` based on its previous value. 

Since `current_node` was 0, 
`current_node` becomes `2 * 0 + 2 = 2`.

Therefore, after executing the code:
- The value of `current_node` changes to 2.
- The values of `h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, `current_level`, and `direction` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a non-empty binary string, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 2, and `direction` is '1'**
