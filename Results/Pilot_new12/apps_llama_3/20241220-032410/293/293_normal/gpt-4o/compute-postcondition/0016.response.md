The code `current_node = 2 * current_node + 1` updates the value of `current_node`. Initially, if the next `direction` in `path` is '0', then `current_node` is 2 * 1 = 2, otherwise `current_node` is 2 * 2 = 4. 

After executing the code, `current_node` becomes `2 * current_node + 1`. So, if `current_node` was 2, it becomes `2 * 2 + 1` = 5. If `current_node` was 4, it becomes `2 * 4 + 1` = 9.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character, `current_level` is 1, if the next `direction` in `path` was '0', then `current_node` is 5, otherwise `current_node` is 9.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character, `current_level` is 1, `current_node` is either 5 if the next `direction` in `path` is '0', otherwise `current_node` is 9**
