The print statement only outputs the value of `visited_count` to the console, but does not modify any variables. The value of `visited_count` is equal to `h`. 

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` equals `h`, `current_level` is 0, `path` is the binary string representation of `n-1` padded with zeros to a length of `h` bits, `current_node` equals `n`, and `visited_count` (which equals `h`) has been printed.**
