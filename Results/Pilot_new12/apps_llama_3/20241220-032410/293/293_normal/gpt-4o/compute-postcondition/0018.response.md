Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character, `current_level` is 1, if the next `direction` in `path` is '0', then `current_node` is 5, otherwise `current_node` is 9 if the direction is '1' and the else part is not executed or `current_node` is 10 if the direction is '1' and the else part is executed. However, considering that either the if part or the else part will be executed depending on the `direction`, a more accurate representation of the postcondition would be: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character, `current_level` is 1, if the next `direction` in `path` is '0', then `current_node` is 5, otherwise `current_node` is 10***
