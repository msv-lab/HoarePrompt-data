The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters, but it is implied that the function is related to two integers `h` and `n`, where `h` is the height of a perfect binary tree and `n` is a node in that tree. `h` is an integer between 1 and 50 (1 ≤ h ≤ 50), and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2 raised to the power of `h` (1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h). The return value of the function is not explicitly provided, so we will denote it as a calculation based on `h` and `n`, which is the number of nodes Amr is going to visit before reaching the exit in the perfect binary tree of height `h`.

Functionality: **The function calculates the number of nodes to visit before reaching the exit in a perfect binary tree, based on implied parameters h and n, where h is between 1 and 50 and n is between 1 and 2^h.**
