The value of `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 1`. Given that the initial value of `current_node` is 0, the new value of `current_node` is calculated as `2 * 0 + 1 = 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a non-empty binary string, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 1, the direction is the first character of `path` and the current value of the `direction` is '0'.

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a non-empty binary string, `current_level` is 0, `current_node` is 1, the direction is '0'**
