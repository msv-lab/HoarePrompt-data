Postcondition: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty binary string with at least two characters, `current_level` is 1, if the next `direction` in `path` is '0', then `current_node` is 11, otherwise `current_node` is 21 if the condition is false then `current_node` is 12 if the next direction is '0' otherwise `current_node` is 22**
