The code introduces a new variable `current_level` and assigns it the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`h` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, where 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 0, `path` is the binary string representation of `n-1` padded with zeros to a length of `h` bits, `current_level` is 0**
