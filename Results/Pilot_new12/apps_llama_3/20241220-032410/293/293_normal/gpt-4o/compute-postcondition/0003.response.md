The code introduces a new variable `visited_count` and assigns it the value 0. The values of `h`, `n`, and `total_leaves` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`h` is an integer equal to the first integer from the input, where 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is an integer equal to the second integer from the input, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is equal to 2^`h`, and `visited_count` is 0**
