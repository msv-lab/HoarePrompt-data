The value of `visited_count` is incremented by 1, so `visited_count` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a non-empty binary string with at least one character, `current_level` is 1, if the next `direction` in `path` is '0', then `current_node` is 2 * 1, otherwise `current_node` is 2 * 2.
