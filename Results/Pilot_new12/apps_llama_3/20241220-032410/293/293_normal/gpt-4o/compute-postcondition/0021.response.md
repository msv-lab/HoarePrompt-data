The value of `current_node` is updated by multiplying its current value by 2 and adding 1. The initial value of `current_node` depends on the next direction in `path`. If the next direction is '0', `current_node` is 5; otherwise, it is 10.

So, if the next direction is '0', `current_node` becomes 2 * 5 + 1 = 11. If the next direction is not '0', `current_node` becomes 2 * 10 + 1 = 21.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`h` is an integer between 1 and 50, `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h`, `total_leaves` equals 2^`h`, `visited_count` is 4, `path` is a non-empty binary string with at least two characters, `current_level` is 1, if the next `direction` in `path` is '0', then `current_node` is 11, otherwise `current_node` is 21**
