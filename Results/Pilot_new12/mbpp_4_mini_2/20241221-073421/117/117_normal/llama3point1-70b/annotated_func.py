#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list containing various elements. It counts and returns the number of elements in the list that are instances of `int`. If `lst` is empty or contains no integers, the function returns 0, and it does not handle cases of `None` or non-list inputs explicitly. Furthermore, the function only counts integers, ignoring other numeric types such as floats or complex numbers, which may be an important edge case depending on the use case.
