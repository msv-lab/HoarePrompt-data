Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the solution required by the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input, which is stated to be a list of integers, as per the initial annotation. This aligns with the problem requirement to count integer elements.

2. **Counting Logic**: The main operation of the function counts the number of integer elements in the list using the expression `sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)`. This expression iterates through each element `x` in the list `lst` and checks if `x` is an instance of `int`. The `isinstance` function will return `True` for integers and `False` otherwise. The sum of this boolean expression effectively counts the number of `True` values (i.e., the integer elements).

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the count of integers, which directly meets the requirement to return the number of integer elements in the input list. In cases where there are no integer elements or the list is empty, the sum will correctly evaluate to 0.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program does not explicitly handle cases of `None` or non-list inputs and only counts instances of `int`, which was an important clarification noted in the annotations. However, the problem description does not require handling these cases, thus the function will behave correctly under the assumption of valid input as stated.

In conclusion, given the assumptions about input validity and the clear alignment of function behavior with the problem description, the program can be regarded as correct.
