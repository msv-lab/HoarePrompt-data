Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement of counting the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression that checks if each element in the list is an instance of `int`, and it sums up the instances where this condition is true. 

Here are a few considerations to support the correctness:

1. **Empty List**: For an empty list `[]`, the function will return `0`, which is the expected result since there are no elements to count.

2. **Mixed Types**: For a list with mixed types, such as `[1, 2.5, 'text', 3]`, the function will correctly identify `1` and `3` as integers and return `2`.

3. **Negative and Positive Integers**: The function counts both negative and positive integers. For example, `[-1, 0, 1]` would return `3`.

4. **Non-integer Types**: The function accurately ignores any non-integer types, such as floats or strings.

Overall, the function meets the problem description's requirements, and I cannot find an example where it would fail to work as expected.
