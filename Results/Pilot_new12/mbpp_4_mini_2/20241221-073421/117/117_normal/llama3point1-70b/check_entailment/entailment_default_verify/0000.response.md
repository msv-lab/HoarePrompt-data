Final: **True**

The original assessment states that the function correctly implements the requirement of counting the number of integer elements in a given list, and this conclusion aligns with both the problem description and the output hints. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression to identify instances of `int`, which is the correct approach as per the problem. 

The details provided in the output hints clarify that the function can handle an empty list by returning 0, which is also expected behavior and does not contradict the problem's requirements. While the hints mention that the function does not handle `None` or non-list inputs explicitly, it is given that valid input will be provided according to the assumptions. Since the function performs accurately within the defined scope of the problem and meets all stated requirements, the original assessment remains valid.
