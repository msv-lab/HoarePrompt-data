Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of counting the number of integer elements in a given list. The annotated code confirms that, right before the function call, `lst` is indeed a list of integers, and the return statement appropriately counts how many of those elements are integers using the generator expression `isinstance(x, int)`. 

Since the function works as intended for the expected input and meets the problem description, the assessment of correctness as **True** remains valid. The annotations support this conclusion by explicitly confirming the state of `lst` and what the function returns at the end. Therefore, the implementation is sound and adheres to the specified requirements.
