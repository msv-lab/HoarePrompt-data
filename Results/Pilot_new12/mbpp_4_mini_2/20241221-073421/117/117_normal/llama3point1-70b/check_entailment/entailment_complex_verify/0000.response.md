Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of counting the number of integer elements in a provided list `lst`. The annotated code reinforces this assessment by confirming that the function counts the instances of integers in `lst`, returning the correct count or 0 for an empty list.

The code specifically utilizes a generator expression to check if each element in `lst` is an instance of `int`, aligning perfectly with the problem description's requirement. The function is also silent on handling non-list or invalid inputs, which is acceptable under the assumption that valid input is guaranteed. Thus, both the original assessment and the annotations support the correctness of the program.
