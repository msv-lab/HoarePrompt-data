Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the number of elements in the list that are integers.

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program assumes that the input is a valid list as per the problem description.
2. **Correct Logic**: The expression `isinstance(x, int)` checks whether each element `x` in the list is an integer. This check evaluates to `True` (1) or `False` (0), and using `sum` on these boolean values effectively counts the number of integer elements in the list.
3. **Output**: The function returns the count of integers, which matches the requirement to return the number of integer elements in the given list.

Thus, the program fulfills the problem statement's requirements for all valid inputs.
