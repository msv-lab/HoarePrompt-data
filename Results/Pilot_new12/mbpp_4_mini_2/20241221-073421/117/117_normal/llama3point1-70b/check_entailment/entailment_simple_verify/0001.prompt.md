You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((isinstance(x, int) for x in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement of counting the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression that checks if each element in the list is an instance of `int`, and it sums up the instances where this condition is true. 

Here are a few considerations to support the correctness:

1. **Empty List**: For an empty list `[]`, the function will return `0`, which is the expected result since there are no elements to count.

2. **Mixed Types**: For a list with mixed types, such as `[1, 2.5, 'text', 3]`, the function will correctly identify `1` and `3` as integers and return `2`.

3. **Negative and Positive Integers**: The function counts both negative and positive integers. For example, `[-1, 0, 1]` would return `3`.

4. **Non-integer Types**: The function accurately ignores any non-integer types, such as floats or strings.

Overall, the function meets the problem description's requirements, and I cannot find an example where it would fail to work as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list 'lst'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
