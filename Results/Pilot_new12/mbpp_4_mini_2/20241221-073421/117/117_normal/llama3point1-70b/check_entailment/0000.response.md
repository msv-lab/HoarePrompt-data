Correctness: **True**. 

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of counting the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression to check if each element in the list is an instance of `int`, which is the right approach for identifying integers. 

The function will return the correct count of integers regardless of the input list's contents, including cases with mixed types (e.g., strings, floats, or other data types) or even an empty list. Since I cannot identify any potential edge cases where the function fails to meet the requirements stated in the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
