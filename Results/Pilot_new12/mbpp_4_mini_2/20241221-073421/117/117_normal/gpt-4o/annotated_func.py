#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list containing elements of various types. It counts and returns the number of elements in `lst` that are of type `int`. If `lst` contains non-integer types, they are ignored in the count. The function does not handle edge cases such as the scenario where the input `lst` is not a list or is empty, but it correctly identifies and counts integers in the provided list.
