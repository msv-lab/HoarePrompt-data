Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list containing elements of various types. It counts and returns the number of elements in `lst` that are of type `int`. If `lst` contains non-integer types, they are ignored in the count. The function does not handle edge cases such as the scenario where the input `lst` is not a list or is empty, but it correctly identifies and counts integers in the provided list.**
