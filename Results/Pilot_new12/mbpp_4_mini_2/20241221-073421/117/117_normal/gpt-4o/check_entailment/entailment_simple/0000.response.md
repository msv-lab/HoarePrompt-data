Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list as specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list `lst`, which is aligned with the problem's expectation that the input will be a list.

2. **Counting Integers**: The expression `sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))` efficiently counts the integers in the list. The use of `isinstance(x, int)` ensures that only elements of type `int` are counted, which is exactly what the problem asks.

3. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions serve as test cases that confirm the correctness of the function:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` returns `2`, which correctly counts the two integers, `1` and `2`.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `3`, reflecting that all three elements are integers.
   - `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` returns `2`, correctly counting the integer `1` and `4`.

Since the function adheres to the requirement of counting only integer types and does so efficiently, it satisfies the problem description. Thus, the program is correct in all potential valid input cases as outlined in the task.
