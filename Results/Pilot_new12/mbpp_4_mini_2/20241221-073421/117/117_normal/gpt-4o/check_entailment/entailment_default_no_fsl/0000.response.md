Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` is supposed to return the number of integer elements in a given list. While it correctly counts integers in typical cases, it fails to handle multiple edge cases:

1. If the input `lst` is an empty list, the function will return `0`, which is technically correct, but it does not explicitly address or confirm that it correctly processes an empty input in the description.

2. If the input `lst` is not a list (for example, a string or a dictionary), the function will raise an error because it would call `isinstance(x, int)` on elements that cannot be iterated. This violates the requirement that it should work in all potential cases since the prompt suggests it should handle a variety of element types.

Thus, the function only correctly counts integers in certain valid cases but does not handle cases where the input is invalid or unexpected. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description fully.
