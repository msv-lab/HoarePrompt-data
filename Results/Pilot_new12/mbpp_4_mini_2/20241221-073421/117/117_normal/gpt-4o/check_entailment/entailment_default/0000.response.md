The program description requires a function that counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The program provided performs this task by summing up the instances where elements in the list are of type `int`.

The output hints indicate that the function counts and returns the number of integer elements, specifically mentioning that non-integer types are ignored. However, it also states that the function does not account for edge cases, such as when the input is not a list or if the list is empty. 

Upon reviewing the examples provided in the assertions:

1. `assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2` returns `2` as there are two integers.
2. `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3` returns `3` as there are three integers.
3. `assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2` returns `2` as there are two integers.

These assertions confirm that the function behaves correctly for the provided cases. However, the output hints regarding edge cases suggest that the function could fail in scenarios where the input is not a valid list or when handling an empty list.

Although the examples indicate the function correctly counts integers in valid inputs, the absence of checks for whether the input is an actual list and the handling of an empty list potentially renders the function ineffective in those scenarios. For example, calling `func_1([])` would correctly return `0`, but if a non-list input like `func_1("not a list")` were to happen, it could cause an issue since it assumes the input will always be a list.

Given these considerations, the function does not meet the problem description requirement for handling every potential case correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
