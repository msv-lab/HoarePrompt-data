Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list, as outlined in the problem description. The use of `isinstance(x, int)` effectively identifies integer types, accurately fulfilling the requirement of distinguishing integers from other types. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works as expected for various input cases, returning the correct counts of integers. 

While the output hints acknowledge that the function does not specifically handle cases where the input is not a list or is empty, this does not detract from the function's correctness given the assumption that valid input will always be provided. The findings reaffirm that `func_1` meets the criteria set in the problem description, thus maintaining the assessment as correct.
