Final: **False** 

The original assessment states that the function is correct because it returns the expected count of integers in the provided test cases. However, the annotated version incorrectly states, "lst is a list of integers" right before the function call, which is misleading. The list passed to `func_1` includes non-integer types such as strings and floats, demonstrating that the program does not meet the problem description's requirement to solely count integer elements correctly. 

The assertion `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2` is inaccurate as it should actually evaluate to `1`, not `2`, since only the integer `4` qualifies. Hence, the function fails in this aspect.

Given these considerations, the program does not satisfy the correctness outlined in the problem description when the actual test cases are reviewed thoroughly; thereby warranting the conclusion of false correctness based on the provided annotations and assessments.
