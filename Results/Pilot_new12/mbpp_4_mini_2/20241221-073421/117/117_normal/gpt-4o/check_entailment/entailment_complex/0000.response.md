Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and counts the number of elements that are of type `int`. It uses a generator expression that iterates through each element in the list and checks if the element is an instance of `int`. The program sums up the count of `True` instances produced by the generator expression, effectively returning the total number of integers in the input list.

The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases, demonstrating that the function behaves as expected for different types of inputs. Each assertion correctly matches the expected output, confirming that the function counts the integers accurately in various scenarios:

1. The list `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]` contains two integers (`1` and `2`), and the function returns `2`.
2. The list `[1, 2, 3]` contains three integers (`1`, `2`, and `3`), leading to a return value of `3`.
3. The list `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]` includes two integers (`1` and `4`), so the function returns `2`.

Although the function does not explicitly handle edge cases such as receiving an empty list or a non-list input, the assumption is made that input will always be valid, as stated in the task. Therefore, under the conditions provided, the function operates as required by the problem description, correctly counting the number of integer elements in a given list.
