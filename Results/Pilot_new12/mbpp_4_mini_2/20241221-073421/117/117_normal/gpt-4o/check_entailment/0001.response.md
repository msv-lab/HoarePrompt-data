Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the list. 

Let's analyze the key points:

1. **Usage of `isinstance(x, int)`**: The function uses `isinstance()` to check if each element `x` in the list `lst` is an instance of the `int` type. This is the correct approach to identify integers, as it accurately differentiates between integers and other numeric types like floats and complex numbers.

2. **Testing with assertions**: The assertions provided:
   - For the input `[1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]`, it correctly identifies that there are 2 integers (1 and 2).
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, it correctly counts all 3 integers.
   - For the input `[1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]`, it correctly finds 2 integers (1 and 4).

3. **Edge Cases**: The function will return `0` for lists that contain no integers, like an empty list `[]` or a list of strings and floats, which is the expected behavior. 

As I cannot think of any input case where the function does not behave as described, the function seems robust and adheres to the problem description effectively.
