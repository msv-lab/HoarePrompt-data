Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The logic inside the function `func_1` uses the `isinstance` function to check if the elements of the list are of type `int`, which is the correct approach according to the problem description. 

All provided assertions test various cases, which include:
- A mix of integers and non-integers (both strings and floats).
- A list with only integers.

The specific checks provided in the assertions return correct counts for each case:
- `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` correctly returns `2`.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` correctly returns `3`.
- `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` correctly returns `2`.

Since I cannot find any potential cases where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
