Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's an explanation of why the code is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `low` and `high` pointers to represent the bounds of the search space, with `result` set to -1.

2. **While Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`, which is appropriate for binary search.

3. **Finding Mid**: The middle index (`mid`) is calculated each iteration, and it correctly checks if the value at `arr[mid]` matches the `target`.

4. **Handling Matches**: When a match is found, instead of returning immediately, the program assigns the `mid` index to `result` and continues searching in the left half of the array (`high = mid - 1`). This ensures that the first occurrence is found.

5. **Adjusting Search Boundaries**: The program correctly adjusts `low` and `high` based on the comparison with `arr[mid]`.

6. **Returning Result**: After the loop, it returns `result`, which will be the index of the first occurrence if found, or -1 if the target does not exist in the array.

The provided assertions confirm that the function works correctly for those cases, and no edge cases contradict its behavior in a sorted array context.
