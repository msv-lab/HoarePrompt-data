Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The provided implementation of `func_1` correctly fulfills the problem description, which requires finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

The annotated version of the code complements the reasoning. It confirms that the program initializes the search bounds correctly, tracks the potential index of the first occurrence properly, and employs an efficient binary search mechanism to find the target. The decision to search leftward upon finding the target ensures that the first occurrence is determined accurately.

The test assertions given at the start align with expected outputs for valid inputs, further supporting the correctness of the implementation. The annotations explicitly state the states before and after the loop, affirming that the function terminates correctly with either the targetâ€™s index or -1 if the target is not found, aligning precisely with the requirements expressed in the problem description.

Overall, the evidence from both the original assessment and the annotated code supports the conclusion that the program is correct. Thus, Final: **True**.
