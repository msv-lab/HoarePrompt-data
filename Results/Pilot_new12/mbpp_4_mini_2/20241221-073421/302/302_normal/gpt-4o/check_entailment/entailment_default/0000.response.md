The program provided is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array using a binary search algorithm. Based on the problem description and the program implementation:

1. The logic behind the binary search allows the function to efficiently locate the target value. It correctly stores the index where the target is found in the variable `result`, and it continues searching to the left of that index to ensure it finds the first occurrence.
  
2. The output hints state that the function effectively handles cases where the input array is empty or when the target does not exist in the list. 

3. The assertions provided serve as test cases and indicate that the specific occurrences of the number `5` in the lists are found correctly at indices `1` and `2`, respectively. The same logic applies to `6`, which correctly finds the index at `4`.

Upon examination, the code does not have any apparent logic flaws and handles the scenarios outlined in the description, including searching within sorted arrays and returning the appropriate index or -1 if the target is not found.

Therefore, after analyzing all aspects, I conclude that the code is correct in every potential case based on the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
