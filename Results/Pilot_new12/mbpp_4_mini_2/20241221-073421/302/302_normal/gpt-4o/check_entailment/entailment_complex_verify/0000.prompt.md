You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's an explanation of why the code is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `low` and `high` pointers to represent the bounds of the search space, with `result` set to -1.

2. **While Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`, which is appropriate for binary search.

3. **Finding Mid**: The middle index (`mid`) is calculated each iteration, and it correctly checks if the value at `arr[mid]` matches the `target`.

4. **Handling Matches**: When a match is found, instead of returning immediately, the program assigns the `mid` index to `result` and continues searching in the left half of the array (`high = mid - 1`). This ensures that the first occurrence is found.

5. **Adjusting Search Boundaries**: The program correctly adjusts `low` and `high` based on the comparison with `arr[mid]`.

6. **Returning Result**: After the loop, it returns `result`, which will be the index of the first occurrence if found, or -1 if the target does not exist in the array.

The provided assertions confirm that the function works correctly for those cases, and no edge cases contradict its behavior in a sorted array context.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, `result` is the index of the `target` in `arr` if found; if `target` was not present, `result` remains -1. The search concludes either with `result` containing the index of the first occurrence of `target` or retains -1, indicating that `target` was not found in the initial sorted list `arr`.
    return result
    #The program returns the index of the target in arr if found, or -1 if the target was not present, since low is greater than high, indicating that the search has concluded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` within `arr`. If `target` is found, the function returns its index; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that `target` is not present in the list. The function effectively handles edge cases where `arr` is empty or where `target` does not exist in the list. Additionally, it maintains the state of `result` to correctly reflect the index or absence of `target` after the search concludes.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
