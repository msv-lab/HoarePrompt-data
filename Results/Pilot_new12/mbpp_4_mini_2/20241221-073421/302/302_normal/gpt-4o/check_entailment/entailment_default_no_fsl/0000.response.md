Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Upon examining the provided assertions, the function returns the expected indices for each test case. 

Additionally, the output hints indicate that the function performs as described, returning -1 when the target is not found and correctly identifying the position of the target in cases where it does exist, even handling cases of multiple occurrences by adjusting the search to the left (by setting `high = mid - 1`).

Since the problem description expects the function to handle all potential valid cases given the input constraints, and the code successfully meets that requirement, the function behaves correctly for all specified cases. Thus, it is concluded that the function is fully correct under the outlined assumptions.
