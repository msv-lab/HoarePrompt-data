You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's an explanation of why the code is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The program initializes `low` and `high` pointers to represent the bounds of the search space, with `result` set to -1.

2. **While Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`, which is appropriate for binary search.

3. **Finding Mid**: The middle index (`mid`) is calculated each iteration, and it correctly checks if the value at `arr[mid]` matches the `target`.

4. **Handling Matches**: When a match is found, instead of returning immediately, the program assigns the `mid` index to `result` and continues searching in the left half of the array (`high = mid - 1`). This ensures that the first occurrence is found.

5. **Adjusting Search Boundaries**: The program correctly adjusts `low` and `high` based on the comparison with `arr[mid]`.

6. **Returning Result**: After the loop, it returns `result`, which will be the index of the first occurrence if found, or -1 if the target does not exist in the array.

The provided assertions confirm that the function works correctly for those cases, and no edge cases contradict its behavior in a sorted array context.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` within `arr`. If `target` is found, the function returns its index; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that `target` is not present in the list. The function effectively handles edge cases where `arr` is empty or where `target` does not exist in the list. Additionally, it maintains the state of `result` to correctly reflect the index or absence of `target` after the search concludes.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
