You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a target number in a sorted array. The flow of the function properly accounts for the following:

1. It initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the bounds of the search.
2. It records the index of the first occurrence of the target in the variable `result`, setting it to -1 initially to indicate the target has not been found.
3. When the target is found at `arr[mid]`, it updates `result` and continues to search to the left (lower indices) to find the first occurrence.
4. The search continues until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that all potential positions for the target are checked.

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for several test cases, specifically when the target appears multiple times as well as when it appears only once (or not at all).

I considered edge cases, such as when the target is not in the array or when it is the only element. In all these scenarios, the function performs correctly. 

Therefore, since I cannot find any case where the program does not work as specified in the problem description, the correctness is confirmed as true.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` within `arr`. If `target` is found, the function returns its index; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that `target` is not present in the list. The function effectively handles edge cases where `arr` is empty or where `target` does not exist in the list. Additionally, it maintains the state of `result` to correctly reflect the index or absence of `target` after the search concludes.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
