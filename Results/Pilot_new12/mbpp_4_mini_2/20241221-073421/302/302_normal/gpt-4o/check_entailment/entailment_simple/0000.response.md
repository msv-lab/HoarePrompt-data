Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number (the `target`) in a sorted array (the `arr`). 

Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Sorted Array**: The function assumes the input array is sorted, as required by the problem description. It utilizes a binary search algorithm, which is appropriate for sorted lists.

2. **First Occurrence**: The algorithm effectively keeps track of the most recent index where the target was found by updating the `result` variable every time an occurrence is found. Instead of breaking out of the loop when a match is found, it continues the search on the left half of the array (by setting `high = mid - 1`). This ensures that the function finds the first occurrence of the target.

3. **Return Value**: After the while loop concludes, the function returns the value of `result`. If the target was found, `result` will hold its index; if not, it will remain `-1`, indicating that the target is absent. This behavior aligns with the expectation of finding the index or returning `-1` if the target is not in the array.

Overall, the function efficiently and correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of the target, or indicates its absence, fulfilling the requirement laid out in the problem description. Hence, the function is correct.
