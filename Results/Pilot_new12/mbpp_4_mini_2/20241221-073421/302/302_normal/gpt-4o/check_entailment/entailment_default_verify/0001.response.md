Based on the analysis of the problem description, the provided program, the output hints, and the original assessment, we can determine the correctness of the program.

The problem asks for a function that finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The provided function `func_1` performs a binary search, which is an efficient method for this task. It correctly identifies the first occurrence by continuing the search to the left after finding the target. The output hints support this functionality, stating that the function not only returns the index of the target when found but also handles cases where the target is absent, which aligns with the expected behavior. 

The original assessment marked the correctness as **True**. This is accurate because:

1. The function initializes the search correctly and uses binary search logic appropriately.
2. It finds and returns the first occurrence of the target.
3. Edge cases, such as an empty array and the absence of the target, are handled per the output hints provided.

Given this detailed reasoning and the alignment between the function behavior and the descriptions, we can confidently conclude that the original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**
