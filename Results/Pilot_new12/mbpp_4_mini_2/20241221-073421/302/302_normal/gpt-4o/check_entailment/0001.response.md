Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a target number in a sorted array. The flow of the function properly accounts for the following:

1. It initializes two pointers, `low` and `high`, to represent the bounds of the search.
2. It records the index of the first occurrence of the target in the variable `result`, setting it to -1 initially to indicate the target has not been found.
3. When the target is found at `arr[mid]`, it updates `result` and continues to search to the left (lower indices) to find the first occurrence.
4. The search continues until `low` exceeds `high`, ensuring that all potential positions for the target are checked.

The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for several test cases, specifically when the target appears multiple times as well as when it appears only once (or not at all).

I considered edge cases, such as when the target is not in the array or when it is the only element. In all these scenarios, the function performs correctly. 

Therefore, since I cannot find any case where the program does not work as specified in the problem description, the correctness is confirmed as true.
