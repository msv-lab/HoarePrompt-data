Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` accurately implements the binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number (the `target`) in a sorted array (`arr`). Here's why it meets the problem description's requirements:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The function uses binary search effectively, which is appropriate for a sorted array. It calculates the middle index (`mid`) and compares the element at that index with the `target`.

2. **Finding First Occurrence**: When the target is found (i.e., `arr[mid] == target`), it does not return immediately. Instead, it updates the `result` with the current `mid` index and continues searching towards the left side of the array (by setting `high = mid - 1`). This ensures that we find the first occurrence of the `target` if it appears multiple times in the list.

3. **Correct Result on Absence**: If the `target` is not found in the array, the function returns `-1`, which indicates that the search was unsuccessful. This behavior aligns with the requirement to return an index (or absence thereof).

4. **Proper Edge Case Handling**: The function effectively handles cases where the array may not contain the `target` at all or where it can be at the beginning of the array.

Overall, the function captures all necessary conditions laid out in the problem description and returns the expected results for provided test cases. Therefore, it adheres to the problem's requirements.
