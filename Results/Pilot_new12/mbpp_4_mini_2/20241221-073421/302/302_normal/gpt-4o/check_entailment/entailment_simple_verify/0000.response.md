Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a target number in a sorted array, as supported by the annotated version of the code. The annotations provide clear evidence that the program will return the correct index, or -1 if the target is not found. 

The explanation in the original assessment outlines the logic of the program, including the handling of matches, the adjustments of the search boundaries, and the final result returned. All these points align with the behavior described in the annotations. The assertions provided also confirm the correctness of the function for given test cases, which further supports the evaluation that the function operates correctly under the assumptions specified in the problem description.
