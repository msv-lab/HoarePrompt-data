Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` implements a binary search algorithm correctly to find the first occurrence of a target number in a sorted array. The annotated code supports this conclusion by clarifying the state before and after the execution of the function, confirming that the search concludes appropriately:

1. It initializes `low` and `high` to establish the bounds of the search.
2. The loop iteratively checks the middle element, updating `result` when the target is found and continuing to search to the left to ensure it captures the first occurrence.
3. The final state indicates that if `result` contains a valid index where the `target` was found, the function returns that index; otherwise, it returns -1 if the target is not found.

The assertions in the original code confirm the function behaves correctly against various test cases, further supporting the correctness outlined in the original assessment. The function handles defined edge cases (like an empty list or a non-existent target) as intended without errors given valid input assumptions, making the final determination that the program's correctness stands as true.
