To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while low <= high` loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the conditions defined in the while loop.

1. The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
2. Since `arr` is a non-empty sorted list and the binary search applies here, we know that both `low` and `high` must be within the valid range of the array indices. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- If `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the loop can execute again. 
- The loop body updates the values of `low` or `high` based on the comparison but generally maintains the condition that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

Given that the only criteria for continuation of the loop is that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, no adjustments to `low` or `high` is necessary unless one of them suggests that the current loop cannot proceed, which implies either:
- If `low` was equal to `high` and was then incremented or the loop terminated, we would need an adjustment to ensure `low` starts at a value that allows one more iteration.
  
However, since we have no specific values for `low` and `high`, we cannot conclude if they need adjustment. Therefore, they can remain as they are if they maintain the condition `low <= high`.

Thus, we conclude:
State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `low` is less than or equal to `high`**.
