`mid` is assigned the value of the integer division of `low + high` by 2. The initial state mentions that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, but specific values are not provided. After the assignment, `mid` will be the average of `low` and `high`, rounded down. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged conditions and updates `mid` based on the relationship of `low` and `high`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `low` must be less than or equal to `high, and mid is (low + high) // 2**
