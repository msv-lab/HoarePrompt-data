Output State: **`low` is greater than `high`, `result` is the index of the `target` in `arr` if found; if `target` was not present, `result` remains -1. The search concludes either with `result` containing the index of the first occurrence of `target` or retains -1, indicating that `target` was not found in the initial sorted list `arr`.**
