Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers and `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1`, while `high` and `mid` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, while `low` and `mid` remain unchanged.***
