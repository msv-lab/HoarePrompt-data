Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers. If `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, `result` is `mid` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`, ensuring that `high` remains greater than or equal to `low`. Otherwise, `low` remains less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.***
