The code assigns `mid - 1` to `high`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, this means that `high` takes the value just one less than `mid`. Since `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, this suggests that the area of interest has shifted left in the binary search context. The values of other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`, and `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, `high` is now `mid - 1`.**
