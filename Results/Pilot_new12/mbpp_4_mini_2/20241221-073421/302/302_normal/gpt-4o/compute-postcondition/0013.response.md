Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers. If `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, then `result` is assigned the value of `mid` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`, then `high` is adjusted to `mid - 1`.***
