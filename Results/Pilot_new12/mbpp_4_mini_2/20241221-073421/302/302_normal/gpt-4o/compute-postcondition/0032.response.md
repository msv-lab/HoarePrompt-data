The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. The parameter `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `target` is an integer. After executing the function body, if the `target` is found within the `arr`, the function returns the index of the `target`. If the `target` is not present in `arr`, the function returns -1, indicating that the search has concluded without success. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returning the index of `target` if found, or -1 if not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers arr and an integer target, returns the index of target in arr if found, or -1 if target is not present.**
