The variable `high` is updated to be `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` was determined as `(low + high) // 2`, meaning `high` will now be one less than `mid`. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers; `low` is less than or equal to `high;` `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2;` `result` is equal to `mid`; `high` is equal to `mid - 1`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers; `low` is less than or equal to `high;` `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2;` `result` is equal to `mid`; `high` is equal to `mid - 1.**
