The values of `low` and `high` are assigned with the following calculations: `low` is set to `0`, which is the starting index of the `arr`, and `high` is set to `len(arr) - 1`, which represents the index of the last element in the sorted list `arr`. The initial state of the variables remains unchanged, except for the updated values of `low` and `high`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`.**
