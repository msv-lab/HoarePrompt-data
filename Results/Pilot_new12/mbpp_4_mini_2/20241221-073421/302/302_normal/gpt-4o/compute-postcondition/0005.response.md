The value of `result` is assigned the value of `mid`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, it indicates the index of the target value in the sorted list `arr`. The values of `arr`, `low`, and `high` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the previous state regarding `mid` remains valid, and we can now specify the updated value for `result`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `result` is equal to `mid`**.
