The variable `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. However, the values of `low` and `high` are not provided in the initial state, only that `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `mid`, but we can express it as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high`. The states of `arr`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged in this context. 

Output State: **`arr` must be a non-empty sorted list of integers, `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`.**
