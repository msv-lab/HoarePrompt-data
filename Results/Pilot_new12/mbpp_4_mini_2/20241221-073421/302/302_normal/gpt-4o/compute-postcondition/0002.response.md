According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the condition `low <= high` is met. Given the initial state, `low` is 0 and `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, which means that as long as the length of `arr` is greater than 0, `high` will be at least 0 and `low` will be 0. Thus, for the loop to execute the first time, we need to ensure that `arr` contains at least one element, meaning `len(arr)` must be greater than 0.

Since `target` and `result` do not influence the loop's execution condition, they do not need any adjustments.

State: **`arr` must be a non-empty sorted list of integers**
