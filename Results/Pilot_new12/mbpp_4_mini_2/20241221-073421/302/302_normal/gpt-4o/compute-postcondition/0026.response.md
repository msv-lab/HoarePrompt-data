In the given code snippet, `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` was calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. Since `low` can be equal to or less than `high`, updating `low` to `mid + 1` will always result in a value that is greater than `mid`. The preconditions state that `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` has been defined as the middle point between `low` and `high`. 

After executing the code, the new value of `low` will be `((low + high) // 2) + 1`, which means `low` has increased and other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `low` is now equal to `((low + high) // 2) + 1, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is unchanged.**
