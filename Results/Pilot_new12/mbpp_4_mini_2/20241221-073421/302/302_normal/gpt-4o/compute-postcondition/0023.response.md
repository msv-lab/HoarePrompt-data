The value of `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. Since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the output for `mid` will be a valid integer that falls within the range between `low` and `high`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `low` is less than or equal to `high, mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**.
