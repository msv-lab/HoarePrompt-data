Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of the first occurrence of `target` within `arr`. If `target` is found, the function returns its index; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that `target` is not present in the list. The function effectively handles edge cases where `arr` is empty or where `target` does not exist in the list. Additionally, it maintains the state of `result` to correctly reflect the index or absence of `target` after the search concludes.**
