The variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, the result is dependent on the specific values of `low` and `high`. However, since we don't have the explicit values of `low` and `high`, we can only express `high` in terms of `mid`. 

Therefore, after the code execution, `high` will be one less than the current value of `mid`, but other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `low` must be less than or equal to `high, mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `result` is `mid`, `high` is `mid - 1`.**
