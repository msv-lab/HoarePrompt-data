The variable `result` is assigned the value of `mid`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, the state of `result` will be the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers; `low` is less than or equal to `high;` `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2;` `result` is equal to `mid`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers; `low` is less than or equal to `high;` `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2;` `result` is equal to `mid`.**
