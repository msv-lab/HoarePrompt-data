The variable `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, this means that `high` will now be one less than the middle index of the current `low` and `high` range. The values of `arr`, `low`, and `mid` remain unchanged in this context. 

Thus, the output state captures the updated value of `high` based on the calculation and retains the original values of the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `low` is less than or equal to `high, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
