The variable `high` is assigned the value `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, which is an integer division. However, the exact values of `low`, `high`, and `mid` are not provided in the initial state, so we can only state that `high` is decreased by 1 from its previous value. 

The other variables (`arr`, `low`, `mid`) remain unchanged, maintaining their previous definitions. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `high`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`.**
