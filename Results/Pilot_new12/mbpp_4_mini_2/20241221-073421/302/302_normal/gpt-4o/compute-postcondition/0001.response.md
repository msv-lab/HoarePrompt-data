The variable `result` is assigned the value `-1`, indicating that no target has been found in the list. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, and `result` is -1.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is -1**.
