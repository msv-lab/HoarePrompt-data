The variable `low` is updated to be `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, the value of `low` is now increased by 1 after this assignment. The initial conditions of `arr`, `high`, and `mid` remain valid as they are not affected by the execution of the code snippet. Therefore, the output state incorporates `arr`, `high`, and the updated value of `low`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`, and `high` must be greater than or equal to `low`.**
