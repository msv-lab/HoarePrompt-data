The code assigns a new value to `low`, which is now equal to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is already defined as `(low + high) // 2`, the previous value of `low` is now replaced by this new value.

- `arr` remains a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `mid` is unchanged as it's not directly altered.
- `arr[mid]` continues to not equal `target`, which is already part of the initial state information.
- The condition that `arr[mid]` is less than `target` still holds post-execution, as we are moving the `low` pointer to search the upper half of the list.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`, `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`, `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, and `low` is now equal to `mid + 1`.**
