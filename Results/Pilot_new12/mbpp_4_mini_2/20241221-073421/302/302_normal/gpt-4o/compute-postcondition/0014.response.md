According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `low` and `high`. The loop will continue executing as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. At the end of the last iteration, if `arr[mid]` is not equal to `target`, then `high` is adjusted to `mid - 1`. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `low` must be less than or equal to the adjusted `high`. If `high` was reduced to `mid - 1`, then we need to ensure that `low` is such that it is still less than or equal to this new value of `high`. 

Thus, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need the condition to hold: `low` must still be less than or equal to `high` after the adjustments. Assuming `low` was not adjusted, it remains the same; we need to ensure that `high` must not go below `low`. 

State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
