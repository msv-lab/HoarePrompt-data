Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s the explanation of why it is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(arr, num)` is designed to find the index of the first occurrence of the integer `num` in the sorted list `arr`. 

2. **Looping through the array**: It uses `enumerate(arr)` to iterate through each element of the list `arr` along with its index `i`. This allows the function to check each element one-by-one.

3. **Comparing values**: The `if x == num:` condition checks if the current element `x` is equal to the given number `num`. If it finds a match, it immediately returns the index `i`, which is the required first occurrence.

4. **Handling absence of the number**: If the loop completes without finding `num`, the program returns `-1`, which is a commonly used convention to indicate that the number is not present in the list.

5. **Sorted array**: The problem specifies that the array is sorted in non-decreasing order. The algorithm, although it uses a linear search rather than a more efficient binary search, does not violate any conditions of the problem description. It will still return the index of the first occurrence correctly if the number is present.

6. **Return value**: The return values (`i` for the found index and `-1` for absence) align with standard expectations for such index-finding functions.

Thus, the function meets the requirements provided in the problem description in all cases stated, confirming its correctness.
