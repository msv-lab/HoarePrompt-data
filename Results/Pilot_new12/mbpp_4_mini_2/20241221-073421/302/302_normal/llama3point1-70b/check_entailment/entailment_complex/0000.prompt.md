You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and num is an integer that may or may not be present in arr.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is either present in `arr` or not. If `num` is present, the loop will return the index of `num` in `arr`, and `i` will be equal to the index of the found `num`. If `num` is not present, the loop will complete all iterations, and the return will be None, with `i` being the length of `arr`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1, indicating that 'num' is not present in the sorted list 'arr'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` within `arr`, returning the index of the first occurrence of `num` if it is found. If `num` is not present in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function does not handle edge cases related to empty input lists directly but will naturally return -1 if `arr` is empty, as no iterations will occur. The function also does not explicitly account for duplicate values of `num`, as it will return the index of the first occurrence only.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
