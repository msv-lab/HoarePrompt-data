Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It iterates through the array using `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the value of each element. The program checks if the current element `x` equals the target `num`, and if so, it returns the index `i`. If the number is not found after checking all elements, it returns -1, indicating that the number is not present in the array.

In the case where the number is present multiple times in the array, the function will still correctly return the index of the first occurrence, as required by the problem description. 

For example:
- Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 3, 4], 3)` returns `2`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `3`.
- Input: `func_1([1, 1, 1, 1, 1], 1)` returns `0`, which is the index of the first occurrence of `1`.
- Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 5)` returns `-1`, indicating that `5` is not in the array.

All edge cases, including empty arrays and arrays without the target number, are handled correctly. Thus, the implementation meets the requirements as specified.
