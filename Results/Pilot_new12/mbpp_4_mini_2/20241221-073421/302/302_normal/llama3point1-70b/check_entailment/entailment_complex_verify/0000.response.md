Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately describes the correctness of the program. The program correctly implements a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, as specified in the problem description. The annotated version of the code further supports this assessment by confirming that the function iterates over the sorted list and checks for the target number, returning the correct index when found, or -1 if not present.

According to the annotations, the state of the program just before entering the loop confirms that `arr` is sorted, and `num` is either present or absent. After the loop completes, if `num` is not found, returning -1 is the expected and correct behavior. The program's logic accounts for the edge cases as detailed in the annotations, specifically noting that while it does not handle empty lists or duplicates explicitly, it still performs correctly under those conditions.

Thus, all evidence from the annotations and the original assessment supports that the function fulfills the requirements of the problem description accurately.
