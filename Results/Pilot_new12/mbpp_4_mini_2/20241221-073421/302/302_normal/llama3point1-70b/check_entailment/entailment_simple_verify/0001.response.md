Based on the provided information, the problem description specifies that the function should find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The program iteratively checks each element in the array and returns the index of the first occurrence when it finds a match. 

The original assessment stated that the correctness is **False** due to concerns about the function's handling of duplicates. However, upon reviewing the program and the annotations, it becomes clear that the program correctly fulfills the requirements as specified in the problem description. The program indeed returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` if it exists in the sorted array. If there are duplicates, the program correctly identifies and returns the index of the first one due to the nature of the for loop. If `num` is not found, returning `-1` is the correct behavior.

Regarding the edge case of an empty array, the implementation also handles this situation correctly by returning `-1`.

Considering the annotations:
- The state before the function call confirms that the input is valid (a sorted list and an integer).
- The state after the for loop confirms that it will correctly return the index of the first occurrence or `-1` if not found.

Thus, the original assessment's concerns about handling duplicates are unfounded because the program does return the index of the first occurrence in all tested scenarios as specified.

Final: **True**
