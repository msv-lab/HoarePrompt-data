Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Assumptions**: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers (`arr`), which is sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer (`num`). The program operates under the assumption that the inputs will always be valid, meaning the list is indeed a sorted array of integers.

2. **Searching Logic**: The program uses a simple loop with `enumerate()` to iterate through each element in the array while keeping track of the index. When it finds the element that matches `num`, it immediately returns the index `i`, thus ensuring it returns the index of the **first occurrence** of `num`.

3. **Handling Absence of the Target Number**: If `num` is not found in the array after iterating through all elements, the program returns -1. The problem description asks for returning the index of the first occurrence, and it states that if `num` is not present, `-1` should be returned. Therefore, this is consistent with the requirements.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the case when `arr` is empty by returning -1 since the loop will not run at all. The annotation clearly states that the function does not explicitly handle edge cases, but as per the assumption of valid inputs, it is correct.

5. **Duplicates**: The implementation returns the index of the first occurrence of `num`, which aligns with the requirement of the problem statement.

Overall, the function behaves as expected according to the provided problem description. Hence, the correctness evaluation is accurate.
