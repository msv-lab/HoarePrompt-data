Final: **True**

Upon reviewing the problem description, the program implementation, the original assessment, and the provided output hints, it turns out the program, as it currently stands, correctly fulfills its outlined purpose. The function `func_1` indeed searches through a sorted list `arr` in non-decreasing order for a target number `num` and returns the index of the first occurrence efficiently.

The original assessment incorrectly claimed the implementation is flawed based on an assumption regarding multiple duplicates. However, the functionality of the `func_1` directly aligns with the requirement of returning the first index where `num` is found. In the example provided in the original assessment regarding duplicates, the implementation correctly identified the first occurrence index (i.e., `1` in the case of the input `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 2`), which meets the problem requirements. 

Additionally, the function handles cases where `num` is not present by returning `-1`, as well as handling empty input lists without any errors. 

Thus, given the sound operation of the provided code in line with the output hints and the problem description, the original assessment of "Correctness: **False**" is unjustifiable. Therefore, the refined conclusion rectifies that the program is indeed correct.

Final: **True**
