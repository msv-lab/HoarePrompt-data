Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

While the program iterates through the array and returns the index when it finds the number, it fails in situations where there are duplicate entries of the number in the sorted array. For example, consider the input `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 2`. The program correctly identifies `2` exists and returns `1` as the index, which is indeed the first occurrence.

However, consider the case where the target number does not exist in the array, for example, if `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 5`. The program correctly returns `-1`, indicating that the number is not found.

An important edge case is when the input array is empty. In that case, the program also behaves correctly by returning `-1`. 

However, if the input contains multiple occurrences of the target number, it may incorrectly return an index corresponding to another occurrence if we assume that the implementation does not guarantee to check for all duplicates and return only the first found index in a sorted manner. 

To summarize, although the program handles the current test cases adequately, it does not guarantee the correct indexing given duplicate occurrences in strict adherence to problem requirements. Thus, this lead us to conclude that it is incorrect, especially since it does not enforce the sort behavior being referred nor does it address multiple duplicates explicitly.

So, upon reevaluation, the provided program indeed does not fulfill the requirements to always find the first index correctly in multiple scenarios, especially with all values accounted, leading to the conclusion that it cannot be deemed as correct.
