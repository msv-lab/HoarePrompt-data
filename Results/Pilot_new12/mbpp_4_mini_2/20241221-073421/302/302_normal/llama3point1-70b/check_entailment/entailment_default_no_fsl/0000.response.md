Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It searches for the first occurrence of a given number `num` in a sorted array `arr` and returns its index. If the number is not found, it returns -1, which is consistent with the requirements. 

Additionally, the output hints confirm that it accounts for cases where the array is empty by returning -1, as there will be no iterations. The function accurately identifies the first occurrence of duplicate values, returning the index of the first one. Since there are no contradictions or missing functionalities in the description provided and the program behaves as expected in all situations described, the conclusion is that it is correct.
