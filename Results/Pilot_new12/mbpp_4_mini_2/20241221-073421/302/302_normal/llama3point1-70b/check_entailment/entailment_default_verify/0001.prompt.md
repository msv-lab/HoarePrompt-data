You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement of finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

While the program iterates through the array and returns the index when it finds the number, it fails in situations where there are duplicate entries of the number in the sorted array. For example, consider the input `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 2`. The program correctly identifies `2` exists and returns `1` as the index, which is indeed the first occurrence.

However, consider the case where the target number does not exist in the array, for example, if `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]` and `num = 5`. The program correctly returns `-1`, indicating that the number is not found.

An important edge case is when the input array is empty. In that case, the program also behaves correctly by returning `-1`. 

However, if the input contains multiple occurrences of the target number, it may incorrectly return an index corresponding to another occurrence if we assume that the implementation does not guarantee to check for all duplicates and return only the first found index in a sorted manner. 

To summarize, although the program handles the current test cases adequately, it does not guarantee the correct indexing given duplicate occurrences in strict adherence to problem requirements. Thus, this lead us to conclude that it is incorrect, especially since it does not enforce the sort behavior being referred nor does it address multiple duplicates explicitly.

So, upon reevaluation, the provided program indeed does not fulfill the requirements to always find the first index correctly in multiple scenarios, especially with all values accounted, leading to the conclusion that it cannot be deemed as correct.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` within `arr`, returning the index of the first occurrence of `num` if it is found. If `num` is not present in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function does not handle edge cases related to empty input lists directly but will naturally return -1 if `arr` is empty, as no iterations will occur. The function also does not explicitly account for duplicate values of `num`, as it will return the index of the first occurrence only.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
