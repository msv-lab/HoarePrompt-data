The original assessment states that the program correctly implements a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. After analyzing the provided annotations and the problem description, I agree with the original assessment.

The annotated code confirms that before the function begins, `arr` is indeed a sorted list of integers, and `num` is an integer that may or may not be present in that list. The loop iterates through the array, and when it finds a match, it returns the index. If the number is not found, the loop completes, and the function correctly returns -1. The annotation notes are consistent with the program's behavior as described.

Moreover, the annotations clarify that if `num` is present, it returns the index of the first occurrence immediately upon finding a match, aligning with the requirement detailed in the problem description. The program indeed handles all edge scenarios, such as when `num` is not present in `arr` or when `arr` is empty (as per the assumption of valid input).

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the code meets the specified requirements effectively and appropriately.

Final: **True**
