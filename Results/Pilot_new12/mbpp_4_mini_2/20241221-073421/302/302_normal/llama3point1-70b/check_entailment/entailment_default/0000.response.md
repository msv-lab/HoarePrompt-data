The code provided correctly implements a search for the first occurrence of a specified number (`num`) in a sorted array (`arr`). It iterates through the array using `enumerate`, and when it finds a match, it returns the index of that match. If no match is found, it returns -1. The logic of returning the first index of the specified number aligns well with the problem description.

The output hints further clarify that the function does, in fact, handle cases of duplicates appropriately by returning the first occurrence and will return -1 for an empty array without any need for special handling. The hints also confirm that the function operates under the assumption that input is valid, which is consistent with the task requirements.

Given all of this, the function performs as expected across various potential cases including:
- An empty array.
- An array containing the number at its first occurrence.
- An array containing duplicates of the number with proper recognition of the first index.

Since there are no cases where the function fails to meet the problem description, the correctness is affirmed.

Correctness: **True**.
