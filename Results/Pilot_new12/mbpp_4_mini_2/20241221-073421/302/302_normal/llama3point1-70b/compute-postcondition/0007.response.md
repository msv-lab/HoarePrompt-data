According to the code, the loop continues as long as there are elements in the `arr` list to iterate through. Since `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order and has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute at least twice. At the end of the last iteration, the loop reached the second element `x` with the index `i` being 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` must be incremented to 2, corresponding to the third element `x` in the list. The list must still have at least 3 elements for the iteration to be valid.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least 3 elements, x is the third element in the list, i is 2**
