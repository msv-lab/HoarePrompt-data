Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `num` is either present in `arr` or not. If `num` is present, the loop will return the index of `num` in `arr`, and `i` will be equal to the index of the found `num`. If `num` is not present, the loop will complete all iterations, and the return will be None, with `i` being the length of `arr`.**
