According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list `arr` is not empty, the loop can execute. Furthermore, the loop will start with `i` initialized to 0, and `x` will represent the first integer in `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `arr` must not be empty, `i` should be 0, and `x` should be the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must not be empty, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`**
