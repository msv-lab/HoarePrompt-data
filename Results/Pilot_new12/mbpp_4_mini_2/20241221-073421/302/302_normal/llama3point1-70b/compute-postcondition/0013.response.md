Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It searches for `num` within `arr`, returning the index of the first occurrence of `num` if it is found. If `num` is not present in `arr`, the function returns -1. The function does not handle edge cases related to empty input lists directly but will naturally return -1 if `arr` is empty, as no iterations will occur. The function also does not explicitly account for duplicate values of `num`, as it will return the index of the first occurrence only.**
