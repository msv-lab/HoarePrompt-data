According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of elements in `arr`. Since `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and it must not be empty, the loop will execute for each element in `arr` using the `enumerate` function. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, which indicates that the loop has executed for the first element, `x`, which is also `arr[0]`. Because `x` is equal to the first element and `x` is not equal to `num`, there are still more elements in `arr` to check for further iterations. 

To execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1, so `i` will be 1, and `x` will need to be the second element in `arr`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can be executed again, we need `arr` to have at least 2 elements, and `x` must be the second element.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in `arr`, `i` is 1**
