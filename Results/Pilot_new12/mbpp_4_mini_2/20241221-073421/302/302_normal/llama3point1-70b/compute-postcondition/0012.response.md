The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `num`. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num` is an integer that may or may not be present in `arr`. After executing the function body, the function can return different values based on the presence and position of `num` in the list `arr`: 

- Case 1: If `num` is equal to the first element of the sorted list `arr`, the function returns 0, indicating that `num` is found at index 0.
- Case 2: If `num` is found at index 1 in `arr`, the function returns the value of 1.
- Case 3: If `num` is found at index 2 in `arr`, the function returns the index value of 2.
- Case 4: If `num` is not present in the sorted list `arr`, the function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`, and return the index of `num` in `arr` if it is present, or -1 if it is not present. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `num`. It returns the index of `num` in `arr` if present, and -1 if not present.**
