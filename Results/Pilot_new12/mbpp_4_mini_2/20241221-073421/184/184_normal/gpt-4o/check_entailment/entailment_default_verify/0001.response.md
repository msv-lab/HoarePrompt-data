The function `func_1` is designed to filter odd integers from a list of integers, as specified in the problem description. Let's assess the implementation with respect to the original assessment and the output hints provided.

1. **Functionality**:
   - The function successfully iterates through the list `nums` and uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the integers that are odd (i.e., those which return a remainder of 1 when divided by 2). This aligns exactly with the requirement of filtering out odd numbers.

2. **Output Hints**: 
   - The hints clarify that the function should return a new list containing odd integers from `nums`. They also mention that if `nums` is empty or contains no odd integers, the function will return an empty list. This behavior is consistent and expected.

3. **Assertions Check**:
   - All provided assertions in the program confirm the correctness of the implementation.
     - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output correctly includes only the odd numbers: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
     - For the input `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`, the result contains only the odd numbers: `[45, 67, 93]`.
     - For the input `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`, it correctly returns the odd numbers: `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.
   - Thus, all assertions support the correctness of the function.

4. **Original Assessment**:
   - The original assessment concluded that the function is correct. This conclusion is supported by the ability of the function to handle all the provided test cases effectively and match the functionality specified in the problem description.

Based on the thorough evaluation, the outputs from the function, the successful execution of assertions, and the alignment with the problem description, I conclude that:

Final: **True**
