Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly filters odd numbers from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension that efficiently checks each number in the input list `nums` for its oddness (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). 

All the provided assertions confirm that the outputs match the expected results for the input cases. The function captures all odd numbers, and based on the behavior demonstrated by the function, it handles various possible scenarios effectively, including:
- Filtering from a list containing only odd numbers.
- Filtering from a list with a mix of odd and even numbers.
- Handling empty lists (though not explicitly tested, the function will return an empty list as expected).

Since no edge cases or incorrect behavior were found in the program according to the problem description, it is correct.
