Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to filter odd numbers from a given list. Here's why the implementation is correct:

1. **Input Type**: The function takes a list of integers, as stated in the annotations.

2. **Logic for Filtering**: The list comprehension used in the function iterates through each number in the input list `nums` and checks if the number is odd (`num % 2 != 0`). This condition ensures that only odd integers are included in the new list.

3. **Returning the Result**: The function returns a new list that contains all the odd integers found in the original list `nums`. If the input list contains no odd integers, it returns an empty list, which aligns with the expectation stated in the problem description.

4. **Non-modifying Behavior**: The function does not alter the input list, as it generates a new list instead of modifying `nums`, thus preserving its original state.

Given these points, the function meets all the requirements of the problem description effectively. The assertions also confirm that it operates as intended with various test cases provided.

Overall, the function always returns a list of odd integers from the given input list, fulfilling the task as specified in the problem description.
