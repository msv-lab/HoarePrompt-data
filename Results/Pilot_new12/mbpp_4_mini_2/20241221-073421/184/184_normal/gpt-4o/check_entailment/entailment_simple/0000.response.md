Correctness: **True**

The program defined in the `func_1` function correctly filters out odd numbers from a list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers for which the condition `num % 2 != 0` is true, effectively retaining only the odd integers.

The assertions provided confirm that the function behaves as intended for several test cases:
1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, which are all the odd numbers in the list.
2. `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` returns `[45, 67, 93]`, again correctly filtering out the odd numbers.
3. `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, which includes all odd numbers from the input.

Given that the function successfully filters out odd numbers from the list in all tested cases, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Thus, the implementation is correct.
