Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the filtering of odd numbers from a list, consistent with the problem description. The provided assertions verify the function's correctness against a set of sample inputs, and the annotations confirm both the expected state of the input and the output of the function.

1. The original assessment was that the function `func_1` is correct, and this assessment is accurate because:
   - It properly filters odd numbers from the input list, demonstrated through the assertions: each test case correctly outputs only the odd numbers.
   - The annotated code reinforces this by stating that the function returns a list of all odd integers from a given list of integers.

Overall, the function adheres to the requirements of the problem description and behaves as expected based on the provided annotations. Thus, the correctness of the program remains true.
