Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is designed to filter out odd numbers from a given list of integers. It correctly implements the logic for this by using a list comprehension that tests each number in the input list `nums` for oddness with the condition `num % 2 != 0`. 

The program correctly handles the provided test cases:
1. The input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]` results in the output `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, filtering out even numbers.
2. The input `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]` results in `[45, 67, 93]`, which correctly identifies the odd numbers.
3. The input `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]` produces `[5, 7, 9, 3]`, accurately returning the odd numbers from the list.

Additionally, the hints clarify that the function will return an empty list if there are no odd integers present or if the input list is empty, which aligns perfectly with the function's intended behavior. The input list is not modified, ensuring that the original state is preserved.

Since the function's logic is sound and all potential cases of valid input are covered, I conclude that the code is correct for every potential case as specified in the problem description.
