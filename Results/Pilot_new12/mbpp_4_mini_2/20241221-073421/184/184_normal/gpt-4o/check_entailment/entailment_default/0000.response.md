The function `func_1` is designed to filter out odd numbers from a list of integers. Based on the provided problem description and the function implementation:

1. The function correctly iterates through the list `nums` and checks if each number is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`).
2. It returns a new list containing only the odd numbers.
3. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expectedâ€”it returns a list of all odd integers from the input list and does not modify the original list.

All provided assertions in the problem description confirm that the function behaves correctly for the sample inputs:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, it correctly returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
- For the input `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`, it returns `[45, 67, 93]`.
- For the input `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`, it returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

Additionally, since the inputs are stated to be valid and the function handles empty lists by returning an empty list, all potential edge cases that are mentioned have been handled properly.

Given that the function works correctly for every potential case based on the problem description and the output hints, we can confidently conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
