Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers and correctly filters out the odd numbers by returning a new list that contains only numbers that are not divisible by 2. 

Checking the provided assertions:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` contains only odd numbers.
- For the input `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`, the output `[45, 67, 93]` contains only odd numbers.
- For the input `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`, the output `[5, 7, 9, 3]` contains only odd numbers.

Since the function performs as expected for all the provided test cases and correctly filters odd numbers from any list, it is deemed correct. There are no additional edge cases that have been overlooked in the implementation.
