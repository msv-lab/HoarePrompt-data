Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` successfully filters out odd numbers from a given list of integers as described in the problem statement. 

The annotations provide further clarity on the function's operations and confirm that:
- The function processes a list of integers.
- It accurately returns a new list containing only odd integers.
- The expectations regarding handling of empty lists or lists without odd integers are aligned with how the function is designed.

The assertions presented before the function definition further validate the correctness of the implementation, as all expected results from various input cases of the assertions match the actual output. Therefore, based on the provided annotations and the original assessment, the program meets the problem description requirements effectively.
