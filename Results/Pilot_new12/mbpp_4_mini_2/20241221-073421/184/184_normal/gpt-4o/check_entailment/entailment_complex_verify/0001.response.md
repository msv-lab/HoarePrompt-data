Final: **True**

The program correctly implements a function (`func_1`) that filters out odd numbers from a list of integers, as specified in the problem description. The annotations confirm that the input to the function is consistently a list of integers and that the output is indeed a list containing only the odd integers from that input. Additionally, the test assertions provided align with the function's behavior and demonstrate its correctness by including examples that produce the expected outputs.

The overall assessment of the program's functionality matches the original assessment, confirming that it accomplishes the task as described without failure. Given these evaluations and the assumption of valid input, the original assessment's conclusion stands valid.
