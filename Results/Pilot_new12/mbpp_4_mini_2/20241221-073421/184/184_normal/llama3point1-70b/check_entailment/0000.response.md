Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is supposed to filter odd numbers, but it actually retains the odd numbers while excluding the even numbers. The condition `num % 2 != 0` ensures that only odd numbers are included in the result, which does not fulfill the requirement stated in the problem description, as it incorrectly implies that the function should filter out or keep only odd numbers. 

For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected behavior to "filter odd numbers" is unclear. However, if we assume "filtering" means removing them, the output should be `[2, 4]`, but it instead returns `[1, 3, 5]`, demonstrating that it does not meet the specifications as described. Hence, it does not function correctly under the definition provided.
