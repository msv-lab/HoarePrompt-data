Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to filter odd numbers from a list. However, it incorrectly does so by returning numbers where `num % 2 != 0`, which means it will include all odd numbers but exclude even numbers. 

To demonstrate a potential issue, consider the input case of an empty list `[]`. The expected result is also an empty list `[]`, which the program produces correctly. However, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The expected output is `[1, 3]` since those are the odd numbers. The program achieves this correctly as well. 

To find an edge case, look at an input that includes negative odd and even numbers, such as `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -3]`. The expected output is `[-1, 3, -3]`, which the program also returns in this case.

While the program seems to filter odd numbers as expected according to these examples, it does not handle the situation where non-integer types may be present. For example, when given input `[1, 'two', 3]`, the operation `num % 2` will raise a `TypeError`, causing the function to fail instead of returning just the odd numbers.

Hence, because the function does not correctly handle all potential inputs, especially in the presence of non-integer types, the program cannot be considered correct.
