You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to filter odd numbers from a list. However, it incorrectly does so by returning numbers where `num % 2 != 0`, which means it will include all odd numbers but exclude even numbers. 

To demonstrate a potential issue, consider the input case of an empty list `[]`. The expected result is also an empty list `[]`, which the program produces correctly. However, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The expected output is `[1, 3]` since those are the odd numbers. The program achieves this correctly as well. 

To find an edge case, look at an input that includes negative odd and even numbers, such as `[-1, 0, 2, 3, -3]`. The expected output is `[-1, 3, -3]`, which the program also returns in this case.

While the program seems to filter odd numbers as expected according to these examples, it does not handle the situation where non-integer types may be present. For example, when given input `[1, 'two', 3]`, the operation `num % 2` will raise a `TypeError`, causing the function to fail instead of returning just the odd numbers.

Hence, because the function does not correctly handle all potential inputs, especially in the presence of non-integer types, the program cannot be considered correct.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and returns a new list containing all odd integers from `nums`. If `nums` contains no odd integers, the function will return an empty list. The function does not modify the original list `nums`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
