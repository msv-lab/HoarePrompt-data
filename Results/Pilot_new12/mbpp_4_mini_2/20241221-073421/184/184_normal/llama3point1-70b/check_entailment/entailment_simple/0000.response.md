Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to filter odd numbers from a given list of integers. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(nums)` takes a single argument, `nums`, which is assumed to be a list of integers.

2. **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each integer in `nums`.

3. **Odd Number Filtering**: The condition `num % 2 != 0` checks if a number is odd (i.e., it has a remainder when divided by 2). The program collects all integers that satisfy this condition.

4. **Return Statement**: The function returns a new list that contains only the odd integers from the original list.

Given that the requirements state to filter odd numbers and the implementation successfully filters and returns a list of those odd numbers, the program meets the criteria set forth in the problem description.
