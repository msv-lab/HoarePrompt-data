Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. 

Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input**: The function accepts a single parameter `nums`, which is specified to be a list of integers, as per the comment. 
2. **Output**: The function returns a new list containing only the odd integers from `nums`. This is accomplished through a list comprehension that includes only those elements for which the condition `num % 2 != 0` is trueâ€”meaning the number is odd.
3. **Correctness of Condition**: The check `num % 2 != 0` properly filters out even numbers, ensuring that only odd numbers are retained in the resultant list.
4. **Unmodified Input**: The original list `nums` remains unmodified, which is also stated in the annotation of the program.
5. **Handling of Edge Cases**: If there are no odd integers in `nums`, the function correctly returns an empty list, which aligns with the expectations outlined in the problem description.

Since all the requirements of the problem description are satisfied, the program is deemed correct.
