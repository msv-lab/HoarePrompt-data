Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. However, it correctly implements the task by returning a new list containing all odd integers from the input list. The potential edge cases that it fails to handle correctly are as follows:

1. The function should ideally handle the case when the input `nums` list is empty. While it returns an empty list in this case, the function's description does not explicitly mention that the function returns an empty list for an empty input. However, this behavior is consistent with the requirements since it still meets the objective in such cases.

2. An important case that is implied but not covered in the output hints is how the function behaves with lists containing positive, negative, or zero values. The code should theoretically handle these cases since it only filters based on the oddness of the integers, but there is implicitly no consideration for the context or description of handling negatives or zero.

Given that there remains a lack of clarity regarding the inclusion of zeros or even negatives within the description, and considering that it doesn't explicitly address how the function might behave with different types of input (as stated in the problem description), it introduces ambiguity regarding the correctness of the solution across all cases.

Overall, while the implementation works as intended for filtering odd numbers, the lack of a clear statement or checks regarding expectations from the problem description leads to a determination of the correctness as false.
