Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate as it highlights a critical flaw in the program: while it correctly filters odd integers from a valid input list, it fails to account for non-integer types. The program's code can raise a `TypeError` if the list contains any non-integer elements, which would disrupt its intended functionality. Hence, despite working correctly under controlled inputs, the program does not handle all potential cases adequately, particularly when it comes to type safety. Therefore, the final correctness of the program based on these considerations remains **False**.
