The original assessment states that the function is incorrect because it does not handle non-integer types, and therefore cannot be considered correct. However, the problem description and the output hints explicitly indicate that the function is expected to work with a parameter `nums`, which is described as a list of integers. Furthermore, it is assumed that the input will always be valid, as specified in the output hints.

Given that the function correctly filters odd integers from a list of integers, returning all odd integers while leaving the original list unmodified, it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. The concerns about handling non-integer types are irrelevant under the assumption of receiving valid inputs.

As such, since the function behaves correctly according to the problem description and expected input:

Final: **True**
