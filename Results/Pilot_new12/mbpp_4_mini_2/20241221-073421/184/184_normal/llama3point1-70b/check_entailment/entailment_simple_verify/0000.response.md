The problem description explicitly requests a function that filters odd numbers. The term "filter" could imply two interpretations: either to remove the odd numbers from the list, resulting in a list containing only even numbers, or to retain only the odd numbers. However, given the context and common usage, filtering typically means removing undesirable elements. 

The original assessment states that the function incorrectly retains odd numbers rather than filtering them out, which aligns with the assumed intent of the problem description: to provide a list of even numbers by filtering out the odd ones.

The annotation confirms that the function indeed returns a list of all odd integers from the input list `nums`, clearly stating that the output contains only odd integers. 

Thus, the original assessment stands correct, as the function is designed to do the opposite of what the problem description suggests if we interpret "filtering out odd numbers" as a need to remove odd numbers from the list.

Final: **False**
