The program is designed to filter odd numbers from a list of integers, returning a new list with those odd integers. 

The implementation provided is as follows:

```
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
```

The output hints clarify that the function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers, and returns a new list containing all odd integers from `nums`. If `nums` contains no odd integers, the function will return an empty list. Additionally, the original list `nums` is not modified, which is also affirmed by the hints.

Evaluating the correctness according to the problem description and output hints:

- The program correctly identifies odd integers through the condition `num % 2 != 0`, successfully filtering them from the input list.
- It returns a new list consisting exclusively of odd integers. If there are no odd integers (e.g., if the input was an even-only list or an empty list), the program appropriately returns an empty list.
- The code does not modify the original list, ensuring adherence to the requirements set forth in the problem description.

Since all potential cases I considered, including the empty list and lists without odd integers, produced expected results based on the problem description, there is no indication that the program fails to meet any requirement given.

Thus, the program is indeed correct in every case based on the description and hints provided.

Correctness: **True**.
