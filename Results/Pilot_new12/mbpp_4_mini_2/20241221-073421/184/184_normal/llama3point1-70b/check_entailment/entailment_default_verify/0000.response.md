The problem description clearly states that the function is supposed to "filter odd numbers." The term "filter" can be interpreted in two ways: either to retain only the odd numbers or to remove them from the list. However, based on conventional usage, "filtering" typically suggests retaining specific items based on a condition.

The given program correctly implements the filtering of odd numbers by returning a new list that contains only the odd integers from the input list `nums`, which aligns with the output hints provided:

1. The function indeed accepts a parameter `nums`, which is stated to be a list of integers.
2. The function returns a new list comprising all odd integers from `nums`.
3. If `nums` contains no odd integers, the function returns an empty list.
4. The original list `nums` remains unmodified.

The original assessment claimed that the function does not fulfill the requirement stated in the problem description and marked it as **False**. However, this assessment appears to be based on an incorrect interpretation of "filter." Since the output hints clarify that the function retains odd numbers, there is no discrepancy between the function's behavior and the expected definition of filtering in the context applied here.

Thus, based on the problem description and the output hints, the function is indeed correct in its implementation. Therefore, I will revise the original assessment.

Final: **True**
