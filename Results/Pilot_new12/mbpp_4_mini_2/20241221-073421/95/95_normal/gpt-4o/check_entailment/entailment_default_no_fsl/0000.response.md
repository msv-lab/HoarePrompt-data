Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case sensitivity when counting occurrences of the substring 'std'. For example, if the input string is 'STD', the function will return 0, but based on the problem description, it should be able to count occurrences regardless of case. Therefore, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case.
