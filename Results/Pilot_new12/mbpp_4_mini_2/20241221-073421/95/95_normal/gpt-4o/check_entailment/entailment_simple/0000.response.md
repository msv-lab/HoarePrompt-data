Correctness: **True**

The program accurately implements the requirement from the problem description, which is to count the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The function `func_1(s)` uses the string method `count()`, which directly calculates how many times 'std' appears in the input string `s`.

The provided test cases demonstrate that the function behaves as expected:
- For the input `'letstdlenstdporstd'`, it correctly returns 3, as 'std' appears three times.
- For the input `'truststdsolensporsd'`, it returns 1, which is the accurate count of 'std'.
- For the input `'makestdsostdworthit'`, it returns 2, counting the two occurrences of 'std'.
- For the input `'stds'`, it accurately returns 1, as 'std' appears at the start of the string.
- For the empty string input `''`, it returns 0, correctly indicating that there are no occurrences of 'std'.

The function handles all valid inputs as specified in the problem description, counting occurrences without any errors, fulfilling the requirement effectively. Thus, the program is correct.
