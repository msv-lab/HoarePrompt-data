Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function to count the occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The function `func_1` uses the string method `.count()`, which accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring within the input string.

Hereâ€™s why the program works correctly for the given test cases:

1. **Test Case 1:** `func_1('letstdlenstdporstd')`
   - 'std' appears 3 times in the string.
   
2. **Test Case 2:** `func_1('truststdsolensporsd')`
   - 'std' appears 1 time in the string.
   
3. **Test Case 3:** `func_1('makestdsostdworthit')`
   - 'std' appears 2 times in the string.
   
4. **Test Case 4:** `func_1('stds')`
   - 'std' appears 1 time in the string.
   
5. **Test Case 5:** `func_1('')`
   - The empty string contains no occurrences of 'std', so the result is 0.

The function handles all edge cases correctly, including counting occurrences in empty strings and varying string lengths and formats. No cases were found where the function does not meet the problem description, confirming that the implementation is correct.
