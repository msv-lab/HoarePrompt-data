Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the input string `s` using the `str.count()` method. This method is appropriate for the task as it accurately counts overlapping and non-overlapping occurrences. 

For example:
- For the input string "standard", the output would be 1.
- For the input string "statistical", the output would be 0.
- For the input string "stdstd", the output would be 2.

Since the function handles all potential cases where the substring may or may not be present, it adheres to the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
