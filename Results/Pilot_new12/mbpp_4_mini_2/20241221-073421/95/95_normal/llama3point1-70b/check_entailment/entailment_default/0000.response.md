Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` utilizes the built-in `count` method of strings to accurately count the occurrences of the substring 'std' in the input string `s`. It correctly identifies both overlapping and non-overlapping occurrences of 'std'. As per the problem description, it appropriately returns 0 for an empty string or a string that does not contain 'std'. The output hints indicate that the function expects `s` to be a string and correctly counts without throwing exceptions, which aligns with the assumption that the input will be valid as per the problem description. Given that the function handles all described scenarios adequately, it can be considered correct.
