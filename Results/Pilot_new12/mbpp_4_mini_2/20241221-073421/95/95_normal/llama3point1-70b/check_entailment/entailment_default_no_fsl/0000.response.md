Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as it does not account for invalid input types. The problem description specifies counting occurrences of the string 'std', but if a non-string type (e.g., an integer, list, or None) is passed to the function, it might raise an exception. Thus, the function assumes that the input will always be a string, which is outside the provided expectations based on the typical robustness required in programming.

For example:
- If `func_1(123)` is called, it will raise an `AttributeError` because integers do not have a `count` method.
- Similarly, `func_1(None)` would also result in an error.

Since there are inputs where the function will fail, it is deemed incorrect.
