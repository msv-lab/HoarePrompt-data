Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to count the occurrences of the substring 'std' within a given string `s`. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(s)` is defined to take a single argument `s`, which is expected to be a string, as mentioned in the problem description.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The method `s.count('std')` is a valid and effective way to count how many times the substring 'std' appears in the string `s`. This directly addresses the requirement to count the occurrences of 'std'.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns this count, which is exactly what is requested in the problem statement.

Since the program accurately implements the specified task and correctly returns the count of occurrences of 'std' in the provided string, it meets the problem's requirements. Thus, the answer reflects that the program is indeed correct in its functionality.
