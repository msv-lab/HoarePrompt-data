Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and returns the count of occurrences of the substring 'std' within that string. It effectively counts both overlapping and non-overlapping occurrences of 'std'. If the string is empty or does not contain 'std', the return value will be 0. This function does not handle any exceptions for invalid inputs, such as non-string types; thus it assumes that the input will always be a string.**
