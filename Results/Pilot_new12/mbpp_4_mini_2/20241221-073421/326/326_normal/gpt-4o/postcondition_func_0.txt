Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or greater, the function sorts the first `n` elements of `arr` and calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements in this sorted sublist. The function returns this minimum difference, ensuring that it considers only indices from 0 to `n - 1`. The function assumes that `n` is valid, meaning it will never exceed the length of `arr`. Thus, the function effectively handles cases where `n` is less than 2, and returns a computed result only for valid inputs where `n` is at least 2.
