Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. 

Here's a breakdown of the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function checks if the length of the array `n` is less than 2. If it's less than 2, it returns 0. This is a sensible check since finding the minimum difference requires at least two numbers.

2. **Sorting**: The array is sorted first, which is essential because the minimum difference will be between adjacent elements in a sorted array. This is correctly implemented.

3. **Finding Minimum Difference**: The function then iteratively calculates the difference between each pair of adjacent elements in the sorted array. If a smaller difference than the current minimum is found, it updates the minimum difference. This is accurately executed.

4. **Examples Given**: The assertions provided in the program test various edge cases including:
   - Elements that are close together `(1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25)` where the minimum difference (between 18 and 19) is 1.
   - A case with only a few elements `(4, 3, 2, 6)` that also results in a minimum difference of 1 (between 2 and 3).
   - A case with more widely spread elements `(30, 5, 20, 9)` which confirms that the program returns the correct minimum difference of 4 (between 20 and 24).

There isnâ€™t a case that I can find where this function would fail to find the minimum difference correctly, based on the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program operates correctly under the given conditions.

Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct and handles the problem as specified.
