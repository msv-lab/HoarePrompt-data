Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the input array has fewer elements than `n`. While the problem description mentions that the function should consider only valid inputs where `n` does not exceed the length of `arr`, the code does not include any safeguards against this scenario. Hence, if `n` is greater than the number of elements in `arr`, the sorting will still proceed over the entire array, leading to improper results or errors due to potential index errors.

For example, if we input `arr = (1, 2)` and `n = 3`, the function will attempt to perform operations based on an `n` value greater than the length of `arr`, which is not handled explicitly.

Additionally, although the code does handle cases where `n` is less than 2 by returning 0, this highlights a potential misunderstanding in the assumption that the input for `n` will always be valid relative to the provided list.

Thus, since the program does not guard against invalid conditions regarding `n`, it is deemed incorrect.
