Correctness: **False**

The program `func_1` does not fully conform to the problem description, which requires finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. The program, however, only computes the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This means it could potentially miss the minimum difference between non-consecutive elements, which is necessary to meet the requirement of finding the minimum difference between "any two elements."

For example, consider the input array `[1, 3, 7]`. The sorted version is `[1, 3, 7]`. The program calculates differences between consecutive elements: `3 - 1 = 2` and `7 - 3 = 4`, so the returned minimum difference would be `2`. However, if we consider the difference between `1` and `7`, it is clearly smaller: `7 - 1 = 6`. But since the program only checks consecutive pairs, it misses this relationship and incorrectly identifies the smallest difference.

Thus, the program does not guarantee correctness according to the problem description's requirement to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, making the overall solution inadequate.
