Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description regarding the treatment of inputs with fewer than two elements. Specifically, the function `func_1` currently returns `0` when `n < 2`, which misrepresents the problem; it should indicate that finding a minimum difference is not possible instead of giving a numeric output. 

The annotations confirm that the function correctly handles cases where `n` is greater than or equal to `2`, but they also indicate a crucial gap in functionality when `n < 2`. The assumption that valid inputs will always be provided does not align with the requirement of the problem description to handle all possible cases, making the function inadequate for scenarios like a single-element array. Thus, the original assessment holds true that the program has correctness issues.
