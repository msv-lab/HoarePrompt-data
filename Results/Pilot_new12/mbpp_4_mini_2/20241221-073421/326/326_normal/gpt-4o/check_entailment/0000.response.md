Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to correctly handle the case where the array has fewer than two elements. According to the problem description, the function should find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. However, if the array contains only one element, or is empty, the function currently returns `0` instead of indicating that finding a difference is not possible. 

For example, calling `func_1(([10], 1)` would yield an incorrect result since there aren't two elements to compare and get a difference, leading to a misleading output. This indicates that the program does not fully fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
