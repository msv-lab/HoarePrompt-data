#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and n is a positive integer such that 0 < n <= len(arr).
def func_1(arr, n):
    if (n < 2) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0 as `n` is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`arr` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that n is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to len(arr)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 2, `min_diff` is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr` for all pairs (arr[i], arr[i + 1]) where 0 ≤ i < n - 1.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns min_diff, which is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr' for all pairs (arr[i], arr[i + 1]) where 0 ≤ i < n - 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n`. If `n` is less than 2, it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or greater, the function sorts the first `n` elements of `arr` and calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements in this sorted sublist. The function returns this minimum difference, ensuring that it considers only indices from 0 to `n - 1`. The function assumes that `n` is valid, meaning it will never exceed the length of `arr`. Thus, the function effectively handles cases where `n` is less than 2, and returns a computed result only for valid inputs where `n` is at least 2.
