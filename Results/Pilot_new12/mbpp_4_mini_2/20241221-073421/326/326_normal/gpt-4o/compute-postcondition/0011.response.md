The variable `diff` is assigned the value `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, this means that `diff` will now hold the value `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The previous value of `diff` was `arr[1] - arr[0]`, but now it changes. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 2 or more, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
