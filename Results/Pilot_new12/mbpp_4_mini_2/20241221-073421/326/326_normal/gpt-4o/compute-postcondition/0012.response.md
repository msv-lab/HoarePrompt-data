The value of `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The initial state indicates that `min_diff` was previously equal to `arr[1] - arr[0]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `min_diff` and retains the preconditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 2 or more, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
