In the given initial state, `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is at least 3, and `i` is 2. The values of `min_diff` and `diff` are both updated to be equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The code snippet provided calculates a new `diff` by subtracting `arr[i]` from `arr[i + 1]`, where `i` is currently 2.

Replacing `i` with 2 in the code snippet gives us `diff = arr[3] - arr[2]`.

Now, we'll evaluate the changes:
- `diff` is now updated to the value of `arr[3] - arr[2]`. 
- The values of `min_diff`, `arr`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Thus, the output state, reflecting the updated `diff` while preserving the information about the other unchanged variables is:

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 3 or more, `i` is 2, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`**.
