The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `n`. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers, and `n` is a positive integer such that \(0 < n \leq \text{len(arr)}\). 

After executing the function body:
- In Case_1, if `n` is less than 2, the function returns 0. 
- In Case_2, if `n` is 2 or greater, the function returns `min_diff`, which is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted version of the list `arr` for all pairs \((arr[i], arr[i + 1])\) where \(0 \leq i < n - 1\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n`, returning 0 if `n` is less than 2, or the minimum difference between consecutive elements of the sorted sub-list defined by `n` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a positive integer `n`, returns 0 if `n` is less than 2; if `n` is 2 or greater, it returns the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list of the first `n` elements of `arr`.**
