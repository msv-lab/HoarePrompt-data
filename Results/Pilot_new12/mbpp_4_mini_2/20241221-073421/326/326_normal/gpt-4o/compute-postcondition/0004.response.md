The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. This indicates that `min_diff` will be used to compare with other numerical values in subsequent operations to find a minimum difference. The other variables, `arr` and `n`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that n is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to len(arr), `min_diff` is float('inf')**
