According to the code, the for loop executes while `i` is less than `n - 1`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, the loop's condition will allow another iteration if `i` increments to 2. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1, resulting in `i` being 2. Additionally, since the loop's range is from 0 to `n - 1`, `n` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue iterating.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with `n` being 3 or more, `i` is 2, `min_diff` is updated to equal `arr[2] - arr[1]`, and `diff` equals `arr[2] - arr[1]`**
