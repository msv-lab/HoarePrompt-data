The code `arr = sorted(arr)` assigns the sorted version of the list `arr` back to `arr`. The value of `arr` changes to be in non-decreasing order, while `n` remains unchanged since it only depends on the length of `arr`. 

Since `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `len(arr)`, the overall conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer such that n is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to len(arr)**
