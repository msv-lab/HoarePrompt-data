The value of `min_diff` is updated to be equal to the value of `diff`. Given that `diff` is previously defined as `arr[3] - arr[2]`, after this assignment, `min_diff` becomes equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 3 or more, `i` is 2, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]**
