According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Specifically, the loop iterates from 0 to `n - 1`, which means that for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 2. The provided preconditions state that `n` is already a positive integer that is greater than or equal to 2, which satisfies this requirement. 

Additionally, the variable `i` will take values from 0 to `n - 2` during the loop's execution. Before the loop starts, `min_diff` is set to `float('inf')`, which indicates that the loop can be executed without needing any prior adjustments provided the initial states hold.

Since the initial states meet the conditions for the loop to execute, and `i` does not need to be adjusted because it will be initialized as 0 when the loop starts, the only consideration is ensuring that `n` is at least 2. 

Thus, the necessary state adjustments are as follows:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is 2 or more, `min_diff` is float('inf'), `i` will start at 0**
