#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum difference between consecutive elements in `arr`.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum difference between consecutive elements in the sorted list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, `arr`, and an integer `target`. It sorts the list `arr` and calculates the minimum absolute difference between consecutive integers in the sorted list. The function returns this minimum difference. However, it assumes that the list has at least two elements, as it does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains only one element, which could result in an error when trying to access elements. If `arr` has fewer than two elements, the function behaves unexpectedly.
