You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here is an explanation of why it works correctly in all cases:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program first sorts the array. This is essential because the minimum difference between any two elements will be found between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

2. **Calculating Differences**: The program then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between consecutive elements. This ensures it checks all pairs of adjacent elements.

3. **Tracking the Minimum Difference**: The variable `min_diff` is initialized to infinity to ensure any found difference will be smaller. It correctly updates whenever a smaller difference is found.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
    - If the input array has fewer than two elements, the function will still work as intended since it won't enter the loop, and `min_diff` will remain infinity. However, the function would ideally need to handle arrays with fewer than two elements to avoid ambiguity (e.g., returning `None` or raising an error).
    - If all elements in the array are the same, the function will return `0`, which is the correct minimum difference.

Overall, since I cannot think of any case where the program fails to find the minimum difference, it is implemented correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, `arr`, and an integer `target`. It sorts the list `arr` and calculates the minimum absolute difference between consecutive integers in the sorted list. The function returns this minimum difference. However, it assumes that the list has at least two elements, as it does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains only one element, which could result in an error when trying to access elements. If `arr` has fewer than two elements, the function behaves unexpectedly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
