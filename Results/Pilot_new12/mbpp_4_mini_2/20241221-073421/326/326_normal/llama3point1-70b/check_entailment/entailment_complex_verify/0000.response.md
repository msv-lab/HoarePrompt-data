Final: **False**

The original assessment states that the program is correct, but the annotations indicate a significant oversight regarding the handling of edge cases. Specifically, the program does not handle cases where the input array has fewer than two elements. According to the annotated version, if an array has less than two elements, the function would behave unexpectedly, which contradicts the general expectations of a correctly implemented function. 

In scenarios where the input array has no elements or only one element, the function will not be able to compute a minimum difference as it attempts to access non-existent elements in the sorted array. Therefore, while the function may work correctly for arrays with two or more elements, the lack of handling for smaller arrays leads to incorrect behavior in these cases.

Thus, based on the problem description and the behavior as noted in the annotations, the program does not consistently meet the requirements as described, leading to a final assessment of **False**.
