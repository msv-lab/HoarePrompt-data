Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it successfully calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements in a sorted list, it fails to address the core requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, not just consecutive ones. 

For example, consider the array `[1, 3, 6]`. The minimum difference between any two elements is `2` (between `1` and `3`), but the program will only calculate the difference between consecutive elements (`1` and `3` produces a difference of `2`, and `3` and `6` produces a difference of `3`). In this case, the program would return the correct minimum difference, but this is by coincidence rather than design.

Furthermore, if the elements in `arr` are not consecutive after sorting, as in the case of `[1, 4, 5]`, the minimum difference of `1` does not come from consecutive pairs, but rather from `4` and `5`. The program would still return `1` because it is lucky in this specific instance.

The key issue remains that the program is designed to only measure differences between consecutive elements, which does not encompass all possible cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is not correct in terms of its adherence to the overall problem requirements.
