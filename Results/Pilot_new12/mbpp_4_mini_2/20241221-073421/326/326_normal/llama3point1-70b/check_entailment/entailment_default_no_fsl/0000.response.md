Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input list `arr` has fewer than two elements. If the list is empty or contains only one element, this will lead to an error when it attempts to access `arr[i + 1]` in the loop. For example, if `arr` is `[]` or `[5]`, the program would behave unexpectedly. The output hints clearly state that the function does not handle these cases correctly, confirming that the implementation is incorrect.
