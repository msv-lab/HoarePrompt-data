To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to analyze what the function `func_1` does and how it aligns with the requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array.

1. **Functionality Analysis**:
   - The function takes two arguments: `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers, and `target`, which is not used in the program at all.
   - The program starts by sorting `arr`, which is a reasonable approach when looking for differences between elements.
   - It initializes `min_diff` with infinity to ensure that any calculated difference will be smaller.
   - The function then iterates through the sorted array and calculates the absolute difference between consecutive elements only (i.e., `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`).
   - If a smaller difference is found, it updates `min_diff`.
   - Finally, it returns `min_diff`, which holds the minimum difference found between consecutive elements.

2. **Comparison with the Problem Description**:
   - The problem description specifies the need to find the "minimum difference between any two elements" in the array. However, the program only computes differences between consecutive elements in the sorted array. This may not cover all pairs of elements.
   - For example, given an input array `[3, 1, 4]`, the minimum difference calculated will be `1` (between `3` and `4`), which is correct when considering the absolute differences. However, if it were given input like `[1, 5, 2]`, the calculated differences would only be between `1` and `2` (resulting in `1`) and `2` and `5` (resulting in `3`), missing the pair `1` and `5`.

3. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the program calculates the minimum difference only between consecutive elements after sorting and does not consider all possible pairs in the array, it does not fulfill the requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements.

Correctness: **False**
