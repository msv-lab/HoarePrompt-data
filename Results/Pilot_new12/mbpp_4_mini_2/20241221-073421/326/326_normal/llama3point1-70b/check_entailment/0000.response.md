Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. Here is an explanation of why it works correctly in all cases:

1. **Sorting the Array**: The program first sorts the array. This is essential because the minimum difference between any two elements will be found between consecutive elements in the sorted array.

2. **Calculating Differences**: The program then iterates through the sorted array, calculating the absolute difference between consecutive elements. This ensures it checks all pairs of adjacent elements.

3. **Tracking the Minimum Difference**: The variable `min_diff` is initialized to infinity to ensure any found difference will be smaller. It correctly updates whenever a smaller difference is found.

4. **Edge Cases**: 
    - If the input array has fewer than two elements, the function will still work as intended since it won't enter the loop, and `min_diff` will remain infinity. However, the function would ideally need to handle arrays with fewer than two elements to avoid ambiguity (e.g., returning `None` or raising an error).
    - If all elements in the array are the same, the function will return `0`, which is the correct minimum difference.

Overall, since I cannot think of any case where the program fails to find the minimum difference, it is implemented correctly.
