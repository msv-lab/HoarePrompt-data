Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the input array has fewer than two elements. According to the problem description, we need to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array, which is not possible if the array has less than two elements. If the input array is empty or contains only one element, the function will still return `inf` as the minimum difference, which does not adhere to the problem's requirements. 

For example, consider the following edge cases:
1. Input: `[]` (empty array) - The function should indicate that finding a minimum difference is impossible.
2. Input: `[5]` (single element) - Similarly, it is not valid to compute a minimum difference with only one element.

In both cases, the program does not handle these situations properly, which is why it is incorrect.
