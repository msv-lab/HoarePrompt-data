Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is updated to `diff` if `diff` is less than `min_diff`, while `i` remains 0 and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`. If `diff` is not less than `min_diff`, its value remains unchanged.***
