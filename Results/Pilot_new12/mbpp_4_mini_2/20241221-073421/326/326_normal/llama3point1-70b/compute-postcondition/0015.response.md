To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, we can analyze the loop's functionality using the information given. The loop calculates the minimum difference between consecutive elements of the sorted list `arr`. 

Considering the initial state and what is required for the loop to execute some number of times, we observe the following:

1. The initial state specifies that `arr` must contain at least 2 elements for the loop to execute, as `range(len(arr) - 1)` requires at least 2 indices.
2. During each iteration, the variable `diff` computes the absolute difference between consecutive elements of `arr`, comparing it with `min_diff`. If `diff` is smaller than the previous `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated. If not, it retains its previous value.
3. After executing all iterations of the loop, `min_diff` will contain the smallest difference found among all consecutive pairs in `arr`. 

Thus, the final output state after all iterations are complete can be expressed as:

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum difference between consecutive elements in `arr`.**
