`diff` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers containing at least 2 elements, `i` is 0, `arr[0]` is the first element, and `arr[1]` is the second element. Thus, the value of `diff` will be the absolute difference between these two elements. The states of the other variables, `target`, `min_diff`, and `i`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must contain at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])**.
