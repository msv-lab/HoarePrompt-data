The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])`. Given that `i` is equal to 1, this means `diff` becomes `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. We also note that `min_diff` remains unchanged and nothing else is impacted in the state.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])**
