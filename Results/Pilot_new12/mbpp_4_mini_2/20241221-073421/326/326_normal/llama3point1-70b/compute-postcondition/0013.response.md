The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. The value of `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`, which calculates the absolute difference between the elements at indices 2 and 3 of the `arr`. The other variables `arr`, `target`, `i`, and `min_diff` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `min_diff` and retains the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])**
