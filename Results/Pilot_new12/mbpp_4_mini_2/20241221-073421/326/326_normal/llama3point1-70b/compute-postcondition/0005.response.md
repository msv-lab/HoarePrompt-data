Initial State: `arr` is a sorted list of integers that contains at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`, and the current value of `diff` is less than `min_diff`.

```python
min_diff = diff
```

Now, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program:

- `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is previously calculated as `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`.
- The value of `min_diff` now becomes equal to `diff`, and the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers that contains at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that contains at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `diff`, `i` is 0, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[0] - arr[1])**
