`min_diff` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. The other variables (`arr` and `target`) remain unaffected. Since `min_diff` is now equal to positive infinity, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity**.
