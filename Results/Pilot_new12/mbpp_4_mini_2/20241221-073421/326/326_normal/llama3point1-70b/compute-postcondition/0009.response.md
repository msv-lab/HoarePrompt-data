The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `arr[1]` and `arr[2]` are valid indices, and their absolute difference is calculated. The states of the other variables, namely `arr`, `target`, `i`, and `diff`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])**
