Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers, `arr`, and an integer `target`. It sorts the list `arr` and calculates the minimum absolute difference between consecutive integers in the sorted list. The function returns this minimum difference. However, it assumes that the list has at least two elements, as it does not handle cases where the list is empty or contains only one element, which could result in an error when trying to access elements. If `arr` has fewer than two elements, the function behaves unexpectedly.**
