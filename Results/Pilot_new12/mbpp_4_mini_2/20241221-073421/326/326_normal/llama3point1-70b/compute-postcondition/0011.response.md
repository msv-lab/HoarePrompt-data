According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the length of `arr`. The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `len(arr) - 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `arr` has at least 3 elements, its length is at least 3. This means that the loop has executed for `i = 0` and `i = 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 2. We don't change `arr` or `target`, and `min_diff` remains unchanged since it hasn't been altered. The next value of `diff` will now be `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. 

Consequently, for the loop to execute one more time, the adjusted states will be as follows:
State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` remains unchanged, `i` is 2, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`**.
