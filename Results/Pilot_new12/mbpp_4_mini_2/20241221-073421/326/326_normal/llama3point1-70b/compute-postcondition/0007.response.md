According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the array `arr`. The loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `arr` is a sorted list with at least 2 elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will be 1. Since the loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`, the length of `arr` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`**
