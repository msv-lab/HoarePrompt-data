Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element, and uses the `count()` method provided by Python for tuples to determine how many times the specified element appears within the tuple. This approach works for various data types, including integers, strings, and more, as outlined in the output hints.

Furthermore, the output hints correctly convey the expected behavior of the function, including how it will return 0 if the element is not found in the tuple. Since the problem description specifies that we assume valid input will always be given, the lack of input validation does not affect the correctness of the function under those assumptions. Therefore, there is no scenario based on the information provided where the code does not perform as required.

Overall, the program fulfills the problem requirements in every potential use case and thus can be deemed correct.
