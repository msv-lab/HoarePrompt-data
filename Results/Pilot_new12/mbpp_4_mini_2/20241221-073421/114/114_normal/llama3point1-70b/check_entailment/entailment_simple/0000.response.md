Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters: `tup`, which is expected to be a tuple, and `elem`, which can be of any datatype. 

The function uses the `count()` method of the tuple, which returns the number of occurrences of `elem` within `tup`. This directly aligns with the requirement to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple as described in the problem statement. 

Since the function strictly follows the requirements without any deviations or conditions that would alter the expected outcome, it is correct as per the problem description. The assumption that the input will always be valid reinforces that the function will perform as intended in all expected scenarios.
