Explanation: The provided code accurately reflects the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as input and uses the built-in `count` method of the tuple to determine the number of occurrences of the specified element. It efficiently handles various data types since tuples can contain mixed types, and the `count` method will correctly compute the occurrences regardless of whether they are integers, strings, or other data types. The output hints confirm that the function performs as expected, counting occurrences and returning 0 if the element isn't present. There are no edge cases or missing logic that violate the problem description, as it has been stated that the function assumes valid input. 

Correctness: **True**.
