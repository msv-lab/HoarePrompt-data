You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occcurences of the element in the tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and elem can be of any datatype.
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)
    #The program returns the count of occurrences of 'elem' in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two parameters: a tuple 'tup' and an element 'elem' of any datatype. It counts and returns the number of occurrences of 'elem' within the tuple 'tup'. The function handles various data types for 'elem', including integers, strings, and more. If 'elem' is not present in the tuple, it returns 0. The function does not perform any type checks or raise errors for invalid input types, so it assumes that the provided parameters are always valid and the tuple is not None.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
