Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it fulfills the requirements of the problem description, which instructs us to write a function that counts the occurrences of a specified element within a given tuple. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup`, which is specified as a tuple, and `elem`, which can be of any datatype. This aligns with the problem requirements.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function uses `tup.count(elem)` to count how many times `elem` appears in the `tup`. This method is specifically designed to handle counting the occurrences of an element within a tuple, which accurately meets the requirement described.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns an integer that represents the count of occurrences. If `elem` is not found in `tup`, it correctly returns `0`, which is expected behavior according to the description.

4. **Data Types**: The function handles any datatype for `elem`, as confirmed by the annotation, which indicates it can include integers, strings, etc. The use of `tuple.count()` does not require the element to match the type of the items in the tuple, so there are no limitations imposed here.

5. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The function does not perform type checks or raise errors for invalid input types, but as per the given conditions, we assume that valid input will be provided.

In conclusion, the program accurately implements the required functionality as outlined in the problem description, validating each aspect of the requirements. Therefore, it is determined to be correct.
