Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple by using the tuple's built-in `count` method. It accurately meets the requirement stated in the problem description. 

The method `tup.count(elem)` will return the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`, which aligns perfectly with the problem statement. The function has been tested against various possible inputs (including empty tuples and tuples with various element types), and it will work correctly in all scenarios. 

Since I cannot identify any potential cases where the program fails to meet the specifications, I conclude that the program is correct.
