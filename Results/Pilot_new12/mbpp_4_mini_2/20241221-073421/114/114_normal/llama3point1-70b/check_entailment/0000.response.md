Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly counts the occurrences of a specified element `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The method `tup.count(elem)` accurately returns the number of times `elem` appears in `tup`, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description. 

The program will handle various potential cases correctly, including:
- A tuple with multiple elements of the target value.
- A tuple with no elements matching the target value.
- An empty tuple.
- Different data types, as tuples can contain any type of elements.

Since I cannot find any input or edge case where the function would fail to count occurrences correctly, I conclude that the implementation meets the problem criteria.
