#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and elem can be of any datatype.
def func_1(tup, elem):
    return tup.count(elem)
    #The program returns the count of occurrences of 'elem' in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function takes two parameters: a tuple 'tup' and an element 'elem' of any datatype. It counts and returns the number of occurrences of 'elem' within the tuple 'tup'. The function handles various data types for 'elem', including integers, strings, and more. If 'elem' is not present in the tuple, it returns 0. The function does not perform any type checks or raise errors for invalid input types, so it assumes that the provided parameters are always valid and the tuple is not None.
