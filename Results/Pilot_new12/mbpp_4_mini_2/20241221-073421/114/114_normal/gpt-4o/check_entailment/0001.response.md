Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of the specified `element` within the provided `tuple` using the `count()` method of the tuple, which is the appropriate way to achieve the desired functionality. 

The assertions, which test various scenarios, demonstrate that:
1. When the element `4` is checked in the tuple, it correctly returns `0` since `4` does not appear in the tuple.
2. When the element `10` is checked, it correctly returns `3` as `10` appears three times.
3. When the element `8` is checked, it correctly returns `4` since `8` appears four times.

Since the code meets the requirements laid out in the problem description and handles the tested cases accurately, there are no edge cases or missing logic observed. Therefore, there is no scenario where the code fails to operate according to the specifications.
