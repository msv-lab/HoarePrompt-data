Final: **True** 

The program `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element within a tuple, as evidenced by the provided assertions and annotations. The original assessment accurately reflects this functionality, as it notes the proper operation of the `count()` method on tuples, which is the intended behavior specified in the problem description. The program effectively handles the tested cases: returning `0` for an absent element, `3` for the element `10`, and `4` for the element `8`. The additional explanations in the annotations reinforce the correctness of the implementation, confirming that there are no edge cases or functional oversights. Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements, and the original assessment remains valid.
