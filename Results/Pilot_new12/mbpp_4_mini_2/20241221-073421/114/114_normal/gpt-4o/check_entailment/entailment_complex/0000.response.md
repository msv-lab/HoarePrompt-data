Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes a tuple `tup` and an `element` of any data type as inputs, and it utilizes the built-in method `count()` to determine the number of occurrences of `element` within `tup`. 

Here’s why the function is correct:

1. **Accurate Input Handling**: The function handles the input as specified—`tup` must be a tuple and `element` can be of any data type. The implementation correctly utilizes tuple methods to count occurrences, which ensures it works as required for various possible types of inputs.

2. **Correct Return Value**: Based on the assertions provided, the function returns the correct count of occurrences for various elements (including cases where the element is not present in the tuple). For example:
    - It returns `0` when searching for an element not in the tuple (`4` in the first assertion).
    - It returns `3` for `10`, verifying that `10` occurs three times in the given tuple.
    - It returns `4` for `8`, demonstrating it counts the occurrences accurately.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles the case where the element is absent and returns `0`. This indicates that the implementation is robust even for minimal cases.

4. **No Missing Functionalities**: The function precisely fulfills the description without any unnecessary complexities, and there are no additional edge cases it fails to consider, given the assumption of valid input.

Therefore, since `func_1` consistently adheres to the task of counting occurrences of an element in a tuple as described in the problem statement, the correctness of the program is validated.
