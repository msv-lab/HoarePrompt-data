Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of a specified element in a tuple using the `count` method, which is appropriate for this task. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for the test cases given:

- In the first case, the element `4` does not exist in the tuple, resulting in a count of `0`.
- In the second case, the element `10` appears `3` times in the tuple, which is counted correctly.
- In the third case, the element `8` appears `4` times, also counted correctly.

Given the logic of the function and the clarity of how it uses Python's built-in method to count occurrences, there are no evident edge cases where it fails to meet the problem requirements. Consequently, the function meets the problem's description fully and works correctly for the provided test inputs.
