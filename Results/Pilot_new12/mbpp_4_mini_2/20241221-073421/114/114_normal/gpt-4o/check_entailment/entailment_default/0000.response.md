The code correctly implements a function to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The use of the `count` method for tuples accurately reflects the intent of counting the number of times the specified element appears within the tuple regardless of its data type. 

The output hints confirm that the function properly handles cases when the element is not present in the tuple by returning 0, as well as cases when the element occurs multiple times. The assertions provided in the program serve as tests to validate these cases:

1. `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 4)` returns `0` (the element 4 does not exist).
2. `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 10)` returns `3` (the element 10 appears three times).
3. `func_1((10, 8, 5, 2, 10, 15, 10, 8, 5, 8, 8, 2), 8)` returns `4` (the element 8 appears four times).

Since the function works correctly for the given test cases and handles the counting of an element within a tuple accurately, we can conclude that it meets the problem description's requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
