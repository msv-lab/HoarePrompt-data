Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` uses the `count()` method of a tuple to determine occurrences of the specified element. The annotations provided affirm that before the function call, the inputs meet the expected types and conditions (a tuple for the first parameter and an element of any type for the second). The test assertions validate that the function behaves correctly across multiple scenarios, returning the expected counts for different elements. Therefore, the initial assessment correctly concludes that the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description.
