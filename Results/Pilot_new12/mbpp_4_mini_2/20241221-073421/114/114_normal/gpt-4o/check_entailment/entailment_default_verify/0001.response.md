Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the specified requirements from the problem description, which is to count the occurrences of a specified `element` within a tuple `tup`. 

The logic of the program is validated by the assertions provided, which correctly demonstrate the behavior of the function by testing it with different elements:
1. It returns `0` for an element not present in the tuple (`4`).
2. It returns `3` for the occurrence of `10`, which appears three times.
3. It returns `4` for the occurrence of `8`, which appears four times.

The output hints further corroborate that the function accurately returns the count for any data type of `element`, handles cases where the element does not exist, and makes effective use of the built-in `count` method of tuples. There are no overlooked edge cases or errors in logic. Therefore, the program meets the specifications and expectations outlined in the problem description.
