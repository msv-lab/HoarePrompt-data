Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and it returns the count of occurrences of `element` in the tuple using the built-in `count()` method of the tuple. 

Here's how it meets the problem description:

1. The function accepts a tuple as its first argument and any data type for the second argument, which aligns with the expectation of counting occurrences of an element in the tuple.
2. It utilizes the `count()` method, which efficiently counts how many times the specified element appears within the tuple.
3. The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases, demonstrating that the function works correctly for different scenarios (elements that appear 0, 3, and 4 times).

Given these points, the program does what the problem description asks for in all potential scenarios described. There are no edge cases provided in the description that would lead to incorrect behavior as we can expect valid input types as stated in the assumptions. Thus, the implementation is correct.
