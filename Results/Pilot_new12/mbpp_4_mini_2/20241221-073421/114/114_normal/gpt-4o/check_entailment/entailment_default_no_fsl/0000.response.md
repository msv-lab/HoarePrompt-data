Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element, and returns the count of occurrences of that element in the tuple using the built-in `count` method. The provided output hints confirm that the function can accurately return zero when the element is not present, as well as the correct counts for the given elements in the example assertions.

Since the code handles the provided test cases correctly and there are no indications in the hints or the description that it fails to address any potential edge cases, I conclude that it meets the correctness criteria laid out in the problem statement.
