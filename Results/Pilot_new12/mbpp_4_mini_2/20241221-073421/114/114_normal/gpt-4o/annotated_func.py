#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and element can be of any data type.
def func_1(tup, element):
    return tup.count(element)
    #The program returns the count of the occurrences of 'element' in the tuple 'tup'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and an `element` of any data type, and returns an integer representing the count of occurrences of `element` within the tuple `tup`. It accurately handles cases where `element` may not exist in `tup`, returning 0 in such cases. There are no additional edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided implementation; it performs its stated purpose effectively by utilizing the built-in `count` method of tuples.
