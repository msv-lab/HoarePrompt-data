#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that there are not enough unique integers in the list `nums` since the current length of `unique_nums` is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`, and the length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`, as `unique_nums` contains unique integers derived from `nums` and the length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` containing at least two elements. It first creates a list of unique integers from `nums`. If there are not enough unique integers (fewer than two), it returns `None`. If there are at least two unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from the list. The code does not handle the case where input might be empty or contain non-integer types, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
