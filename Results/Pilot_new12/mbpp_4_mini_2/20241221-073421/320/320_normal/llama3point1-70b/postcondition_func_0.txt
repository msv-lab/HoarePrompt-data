The function accepts a list of integers `nums` containing at least two elements. It first creates a list of unique integers from `nums`. If there are not enough unique integers (fewer than two), it returns `None`. If there are at least two unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from the list. The code does not handle the case where input might be empty or contain non-integer types, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
