You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that there are not enough unique integers in the list `nums` since the current length of `unique_nums` is less than 2.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`, and the length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`, as `unique_nums` contains unique integers derived from `nums` and the length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` containing at least two elements. It first creates a list of unique integers from `nums`. If there are not enough unique integers (fewer than two), it returns `None`. If there are at least two unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from the list. The code does not handle the case where input might be empty or contain non-integer types, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
