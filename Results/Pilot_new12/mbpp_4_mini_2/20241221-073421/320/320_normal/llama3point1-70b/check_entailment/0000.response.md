Correctness: **True**.

The function first converts the list into a set to remove any duplicates, ensuring that only unique values are considered. Then, it checks if the number of unique numbers is less than two; if so, it returns `None`, which handles cases where there is no second smallest number. If there are at least two unique numbers, the function sorts them and returns the second smallest. This logic correctly addresses the task of finding the second smallest number in a list for all possible cases, including lists with duplicates and cases where the list may have fewer than two unique numbers.
