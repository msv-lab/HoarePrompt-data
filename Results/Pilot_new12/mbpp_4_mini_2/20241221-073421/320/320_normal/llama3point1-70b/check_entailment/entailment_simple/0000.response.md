Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Unique Elements**: The program first converts the input list `nums` into a list of unique elements using `set(nums)`, which eliminates any duplicates and ensures that the second smallest number will be unique.

2. **Length Check**: The program checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. However, per the problem description, we assume that the input list has at least two elements. Therefore, this check is effectively redundant under the given assumptions, but it doesn't detract from correctness.

3. **Sorting and Returning the Second Smallest**: The program sorts the list of unique numbers and returns the second element `sorted(unique_nums)[1]`, which corresponds to the second smallest number in the original list. This behavior aligns directly with the requirement to find the second smallest number.

Given these points, the program consistently meets the problem requirements for valid inputs, leading to the conclusion that it is correct.
