To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the function step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to write a function that finds the second smallest number in a list.

### Function Breakdown:
1. **Input:** The function takes a single parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of numbers.
2. **Unique Numbers:** The function converts the list to a set to remove duplicates and then back to a list, resulting in `unique_nums`.
3. **Check Length:** It checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If so, it returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest number.
4. **Sorting:** If there are at least 2 unique numbers, it sorts the list and returns the second element.

### Example Cases:
- Case 1: `func_1([1, 2, 3])` should return `2`. (Correct)
- Case 2: `func_1([3, 3, 3])` should return `None` since there is only one unique number. (Correct)
- Case 3: `func_1([5, 5, 5, 4])` should return `None` since there is only one unique number (5). (Correct)
- Case 4: `func_1([])` should return `None` since the list is empty. (Correct)
- Case 5: `func_1([10])` should return `None` since there is only one unique number (10). (Correct)

### Edge Cases:
1. **Negative Numbers:** `func_1([-1, -2, -3])` should return `-2`. (Correct)
2. **Mixed Numbers:** `func_1([0, -1, -2])` should return `-1`. (Correct)

### Analysis of Potential Cases:
Now let's consider the negative case where the input may not yield the expected second smallest number:
- If `func_1([2, 3, 3, 1, 2])` is tested, it should return `2`, as expected. 

However, if there are any inputs that are missed while on `nums` list that return `None`, since there could be elements that could cause short-circuiting.

### Conclusion:
After carefully analyzing the code against various potential input cases, no scenarios are found where the function does not behave according to the problem description. The function properly handles unique values, insufficient length, and provides correct outputs for the second smallest number.

Correctness: **True**
