The code creates a set from the list `nums` to remove duplicates and then converts it back into a list. Thus, `unique_nums` will contain only the unique integers from `nums`. The original `nums` list remains unchanged, but `unique_nums` will hold the unique values.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements, `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`.**
