The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and processes it to derive a list of unique integers. It then sorts this list of unique integers and returns the second smallest integer from this sorted list if there is more than one unique integer present. If there is only one unique integer or the list contains only identical elements, the function returns None. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains only one element, as the provided precondition assures that `nums` contains at least two distinct elements.
