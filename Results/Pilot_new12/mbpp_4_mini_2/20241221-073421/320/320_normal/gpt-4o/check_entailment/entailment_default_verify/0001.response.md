Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` successfully meets the problem description by effectively finding the second smallest number in a list of integers. The logic of using `set` to capture unique integers and sorting them to find the second smallest is sound.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves correctly in scenarios where there are at least two distinct integers in the input list. They also acknowledge that the function will return `None` if there are not enough unique integers, aligning with the problem requirements. Specifically, the function was designed under the assumption that the input list would contain at least two distinct elements, as stated in the output hints. 

Thus, both the problem description and the hints support the correctness of the function, leading to the conclusion that the original assessment stands firm.
