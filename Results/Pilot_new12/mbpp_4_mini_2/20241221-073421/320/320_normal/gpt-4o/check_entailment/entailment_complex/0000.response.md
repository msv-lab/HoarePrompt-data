Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which states that it must find the second smallest number in a list. The function `func_1` does the following:

1. It takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input.
2. It creates a set from the list to remove any duplicate numbers, ensuring that only unique integers are considered.
3. It sorts the unique integers.
4. If there are more than one unique integers, it returns the second element of the sorted list (which is the second smallest number). If there is only one unique integer, it returns `None`.

The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function behaves as expected for various scenarios:
- In the case of `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the unique integers sorted are `[-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]` and the second smallest is `-2`.
- In the case of `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the unique integers sorted are `[-2, -0.5, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest is `-0.5`.
- For lists that consist of identical elements, like `[2, 2]` and `[2, 2, 2]`, the function correctly returns `None` as there is no second unique integer.

The annotations and the function logic ensure compliance with the problem description, as it effectively finds the second smallest unique number in a confirmed valid input list. Thus, the function fulfills the requirements accurately.
