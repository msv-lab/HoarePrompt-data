You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]) == -2
assert func_1([1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]) == -0.5
assert func_1([2, 2]) == None
assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None

def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the second smallest number in a list as per the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it handles different cases:

1. **General Case**: The function uses `set` to remove duplicates from the list, then sorts the unique numbers. If there is more than one unique number, it returns the second one. This logic satisfies the requirement to find the second smallest number.

2. **Empty List**: If the input is an empty list, calling `set(nums)` would still return an empty set, leading to `unique_nums` being empty, thus returning `None`. This follows the requirement to return `None` when there are not enough unique numbers.

3. **All Elements Are Equal**: If the list consists of the same number (e.g., `[2, 2]` or `[2, 2, 2]`), the function will convert the list to a set which results in a single unique number. Hence, `len(unique_nums)` will be 1, and `None` will be returned, which is the expected behavior.

4. **Negative and Positive Numbers**: The function correctly handles lists that contain negative numbers, positive numbers, or a mix of both, as it sorts the unique numbers and retrieves the second smallest properly.

The given assertions in the program also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various test cases. Therefore, there are no evident cases where the function fails to meet the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and processes it to derive a list of unique integers. It then sorts this list of unique integers and returns the second smallest integer from this sorted list if there is more than one unique integer present. If there is only one unique integer or the list contains only identical elements, the function returns None. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains only one element, as the provided precondition assures that `nums` contains at least two distinct elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
