Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, we can analyze the correctness of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description Review:
The task is to write a function that finds the second smallest number in a list. The expected behavior of the function is to:

- Return the second smallest unique number when there are at least two distinct elements in the input list.
- Return `None` if there are not at least two distinct elements in the input list.

### Program and Annotations:
The function `func_1` works as follows:
1. It converts the input list `nums` into a set to eliminate duplicates, creating `unique_nums`.
2. It sorts `unique_nums` in ascending order.
3. If `unique_nums` contains more than one element, it returns the second smallest number (the value at index 1). If not, it returns `None`.

The annotations indicate that the input `nums` is expected to be a list of integers containing at least two distinct elements before the function is called, which aligns with the program's intended logic based on the problem description.

### Assessment of Original Assessment:
The original assessment stated the correctness of the function as **True**, which appears accurate based on the following reasoning:

1. The assertions test the function against various scenarios, including lists with both positive and negative numbers, duplicates, and correctly check for the expected output of `None` when there are not enough distinct elements.
2. The annotations accurately describe the state of the program and the behavior of the function, confirming that it handles the requirements of the problem description well.
3. There are no edge cases where the function would fail to produce the correct output given the valid input assumption.

Taking all this into account, the original assessment aligns with the expectations set out by both the problem description and the annotated states of the program.

### Final Assessment:
Final: **True**
