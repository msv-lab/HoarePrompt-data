Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program correctly identifies the second smallest number in a list. Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` first converts the input list `nums` into a set to eliminate any duplicate values. 
2. It then sorts the unique values in ascending order.
3. If there are more than one unique numbers, it returns the second element (index 1) of the sorted list.
4. If there's only one unique number (or the input list is empty), the function returns `None`.

The assertions provided cover various scenarios—including negative numbers and duplicates—and all pass as expected. There are no evident edge cases where the implementation fails to meet the problem requirements.
