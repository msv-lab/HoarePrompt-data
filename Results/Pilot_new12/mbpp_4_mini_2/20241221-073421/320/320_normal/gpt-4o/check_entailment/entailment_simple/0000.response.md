Correctness: **False**

The program does not strictly meet the requirements of the problem description. While the function `func_1` is designed to find the second smallest number in a list by first creating a set of unique numbers (to eliminate duplicates) and then sorting that set, it has a flaw in returning `None` when the list contains either two identical elements (e.g., `[2, 2]`) or more identical elements (e.g., `[2, 2, 2]`). 

The problem description does not specify any conditions regarding duplicates in the input list. The second smallest number should still be identifiable in cases with duplicate numbers, and ideally, the program should return the second smallest unique number only if there is at least one distinct number present. Given that the function checks for distinct elements before returning `None`, it could fail to meet the expectations of the specified behavior if the input list does not possess at least two distinct values. 

For example:
- In the test case `func_1([2, 2])`, it should ideally return `None` as there is no second smallest number.
- However, it fails to account for finding the second smallest number in lists where there are distinct elements and duplicates.

Thus, the program does not conform to the problem description for all potential cases, specifically when considering how to handle lists where duplicates exist but there are distinct values as well.
