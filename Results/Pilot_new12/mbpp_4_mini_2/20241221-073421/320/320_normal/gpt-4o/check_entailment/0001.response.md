Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the second smallest number in a list as per the problem description. Here's a breakdown of how it handles different cases:

1. **General Case**: The function uses `set` to remove duplicates from the list, then sorts the unique numbers. If there is more than one unique number, it returns the second one. This logic satisfies the requirement to find the second smallest number.

2. **Empty List**: If the input is an empty list, calling `set(nums)` would still return an empty set, leading to `unique_nums` being empty, thus returning `None`. This follows the requirement to return `None` when there are not enough unique numbers.

3. **All Elements Are Equal**: If the list consists of the same number (e.g., `[2, 2]` or `[2, 2, 2]`), the function will convert the list to a set which results in a single unique number. Hence, `len(unique_nums)` will be 1, and `None` will be returned, which is the expected behavior.

4. **Negative and Positive Numbers**: The function correctly handles lists that contain negative numbers, positive numbers, or a mix of both, as it sorts the unique numbers and retrieves the second smallest properly.

The given assertions in the program also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various test cases. Therefore, there are no evident cases where the function fails to meet the problem description.
