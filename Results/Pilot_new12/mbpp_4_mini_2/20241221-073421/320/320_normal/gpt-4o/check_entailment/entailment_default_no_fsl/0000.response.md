Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input list contains fewer than two distinct elements. Specifically, the output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains only one unique element. Although the precondition assures that `nums` contains at least two distinct elements, the assertion cases demonstrate that it does not handle lists with only two equal elements correctly.

For example, the assertions:
```python
assert func_1([2, 2]) == None
assert func_1([2, 2, 2]) == None
```
indicate that the function will return `None` instead of a valid second smallest number, which is incorrect according to the intended requirement of finding the second smallest number. 

The fact that it only returns `None` for such cases, combined with its inability to return an appropriate second smallest number for lists that do not meet the required conditions of having at least two distinct integers, confirms that the program is not correct. Therefore, it fails to satisfy the problem description for every potential case.
