The variable `unique_nums` is assigned the value of sorted unique elements from the list `nums`. Since `nums` contains at least two distinct elements, the `set(nums)` function creates a set of unique numbers, removing any duplicates. The `sorted()` function then arranges these unique numbers in ascending order. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state will reflect the new value of `unique_nums` as the sorted list of unique integers from `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers containing at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is the sorted list of unique integers from `nums`.**
