The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers that contains at least two distinct elements. After executing the function body, the program returns the second smallest unique integer from the sorted list of unique integers derived from `nums`, provided that this list of unique integers contains more than one element. If the list does not satisfy this condition, the function returns None. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return the second smallest unique integer from that list if applicable; otherwise, it returns None. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums`, returns the second smallest unique integer from the sorted unique integers derived from `nums` if there is more than one unique integer; otherwise, it returns None.**
