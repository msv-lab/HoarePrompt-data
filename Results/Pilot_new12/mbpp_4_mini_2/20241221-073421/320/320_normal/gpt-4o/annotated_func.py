#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers, and the list contains at least two distinct elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = sorted(set(nums))
    return unique_nums[1] if len(unique_nums) > 1 else None
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the sorted list of unique integers derived from 'nums', provided that 'unique_nums' contains more than one element, otherwise it returns None.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and processes it to derive a list of unique integers. It then sorts this list of unique integers and returns the second smallest integer from this sorted list if there is more than one unique integer present. If there is only one unique integer or the list contains only identical elements, the function returns None. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains only one element, as the provided precondition assures that `nums` contains at least two distinct elements.
