#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_str is a string.
def func_1(input_str):
    return input_str.replace(' ', '')
    #The program returns the string input_str with all spaces removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `input_str`, which is expected to be a string. It returns a new string with all whitespace characters removed from `input_str`. This includes spaces, but the code as it stands only explicitly removes space characters (' '). The function doesn't handle other types of whitespace, such as tabs or newlines. Therefore, the final state of the program has a string with spaces removed, but any other whitespace characters will remain intact, which may not meet the user's expectations if they intend to remove all forms of whitespace.
