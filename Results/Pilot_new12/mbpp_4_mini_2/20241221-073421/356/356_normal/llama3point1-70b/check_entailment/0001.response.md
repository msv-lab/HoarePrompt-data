Correctness: **False**

The provided program `func_1` only removes spaces (' ') from the input string. However, the problem description states to remove all whitespaces, which include not just spaces, but also tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and other whitespace characters. 

For instance, if the input is `"Hello,\nworld!  "` (which contains a newline and spaces), the program will return `"Hello,world!"`, but it fails to remove the newline character. 

Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirement of removing all forms of whitespace from the string. Hence, it is incorrect.
