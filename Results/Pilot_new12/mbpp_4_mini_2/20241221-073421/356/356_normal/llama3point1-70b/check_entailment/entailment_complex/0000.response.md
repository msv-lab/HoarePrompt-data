Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. According to the problem description, the function is required to remove all whitespaces from a string, which includes not just spaces but also other types of whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and any other whitespace characters.

However, the annotated program only explicitly replaces space characters (' '). This means that while spaces will be removed, other whitespace characters will remain, thus failing to fully satisfy the problem's requirement to remove all whitespace.

Therefore, the code does not do what the problem description asks for all potential cases involving different types of whitespace.
