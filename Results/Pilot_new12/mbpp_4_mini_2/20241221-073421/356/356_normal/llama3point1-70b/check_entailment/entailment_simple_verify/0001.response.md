Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program `func_1` only removes spaces from the input string, failing to address other forms of whitespace such as tabs and newlines, which are explicitly considered whitespace according to the problem description. The annotation indicates that the function only uses `replace(' ', '')`, further supporting the claim that the implementation does not meet the requirement to remove all whitespace characters. Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem's expectations and is therefore incorrect.
