Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program `func_1` does not meet the specifications of the problem description, which requires the removal of all whitespace characters, not just spaces. The annotations reinforce this point, clarifying that while the function removes spaces, it does not handle other whitespace characters such as tabs and newlines. Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotated evidence, the program is indeed incorrect as it fails to fulfill the requirement of removing all forms of whitespace.
