Correctness: **False**

The program does not satisfy the problem description completely. The requirement is to remove "all whitespaces" from a string. However, the current implementation only removes spaces (' ') and not other types of whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and others.

To meet the requirements of the problem description, the function should use a method that removes all forms of whitespace, such as the `str.replace()` method for all potential whitespace characters, or utilize a regex approach or the `str.split()` and `str.join()` method combination. 

Therefore, the current implementation fails to fulfill the problem description by potentially leaving other whitespace characters in the string.
