Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program `func_1` only specifically removes space characters (' ') from the input string, failing to account for other types of whitespace such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or any other whitespace characters. The problem description clearly states the need to remove "all whitespaces," which extends beyond just space characters. This discrepancy indicates that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem, thus confirming its incorrectness. The output hints further corroborate this assessment, noting that the function does not handle all forms of whitespace, leaving other whitespace characters intact in the returned string.
