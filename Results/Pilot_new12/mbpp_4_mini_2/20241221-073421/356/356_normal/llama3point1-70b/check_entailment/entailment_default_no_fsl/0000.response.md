Correctness: **False**

The provided program only removes space characters (' ') from the input string. The problem description specifies that the function should remove all whitespaces from a string, which includes spaces, tabs, newlines, and any other types of whitespace characters. Since the current implementation does not handle other whitespace types, such as `\t` (tab) and `\n` (newline), it doesn't satisfy the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. For example, given the input string `"Hello\tWorld\n"`, the function would return `"HelloWorld\n"`, which still contains a newline character. This indicates that the function does not meet the expectations laid out in the problem description.
