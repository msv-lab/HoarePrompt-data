Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The program is supposed to remove all whitespace characters from a string, but the code only removes spaces (i.e., the character `' '`). Other whitespace characters like tabs (`'\t'`) and newlines (`'\n'`) will remain intact in the output string. This does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description, which specifies removing all whitespaces. Therefore, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases.
