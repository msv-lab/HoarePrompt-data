The provided program, `func_1(s)`, seeks to remove whitespaces from a string as specified in the problem description. However, the output hints clarify some limitations of the implementation. 

While the function correctly removes spaces, it does not account for other types of whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or leading/trailing spaces beyond the first and last characters. This could lead to unexpected results if the input string includes these characters. 

According to the output hints:
- The function is said to return a new string with "all whitespace characters (including spaces) removed" which suggests that it should handle more than just empty spaces.
- It also states that the function "does not handle or account for leading or trailing whitespace or other types of whitespace like tabs or newlines," which directly contradicts the requirement to remove "all whitespaces."

Given this analysis, the original assessment that the program is "Correct" is incorrect because the function fails to handle various edge cases specified above, which could result in incorrect behavior. 

Thus, the final correctness evaluation of the program is:

Final: **False**
