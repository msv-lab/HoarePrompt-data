Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements described in the problem description. While the function `func_1` correctly removes spaces from the string, it does not account for all types of whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or other whitespace characters. According to the annotations, the function is only aimed at removing spaces, and the description notes that it may lead to unexpected results if other types of whitespace are present. 

For example, if the input string were to contain tabs or newlines, the function would not remove those characters:

```python
assert func_1('python\tprogram') == 'pythonprogram'  # Expected to fail
assert func_1('python\nprogram') == 'pythonprogram'   # Expected to fail
```

Therefore, since the program does not handle all whitespace characters as required by the problem description, it is incorrect.
