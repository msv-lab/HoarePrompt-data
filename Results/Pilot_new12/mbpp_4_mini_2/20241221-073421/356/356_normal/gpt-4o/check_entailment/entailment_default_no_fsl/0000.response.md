Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it successfully removes space characters from the input string, it fails to handle other types of whitespace, such as tabs (`\t`) and newlines (`\n`). For example, the input `'python\tprogram'` would not be correctly processed, as the program only removes spaces. This indicates that the function does not account for the complete range of whitespace characters, leading to potential incorrect results for various inputs that include these characters. Therefore, the function is not correct for every potential case outlined in the problem description.
