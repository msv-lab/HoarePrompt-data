Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the function required by the problem description to remove all whitespaces from a string. The annotated version of the code and the assertions provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for various test cases. Each assertion correctly verifies the functionality of the `func_1` method against multiple scenarios, ensuring it handles leading, trailing, and multiple spaces effectively.

The reasoning in the original assessment is valid and supported by the annotations. The program uses the `replace` method to eliminate all occurrences of spaces, which aligns directly with the problem's requirements. The annotations likewise confirm that the state of the program is managed correctly, reinforcing the correctness of the function.

Overall, the original assessment is accurate, and there are no aspects of the program or its logic that suggest it fails to meet the problem description. Hence, the final conclusion is that the program is correct.
