Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to remove all whitespaces from a string. 

### Explanation:
1. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a single string argument `s`.
2. Inside the function, the method `replace(' ', '')` is used to replace all instances of a single space character with an empty string, effectively removing all spaces from the input string.
3. The given assertions check the function's output against expected results, confirming that it behaves correctly for different scenarios of input strings with various placements and quantities of whitespace.

Because `replace` specifically targets spaces and replaces them entirely, the function will correctly handle the removal of all whitespaces from the input string, fulfilling the problem requirements. The assumptions made about the input being valid ensure that we do not need to handle unexpected cases or errors, supporting the correctness of the implementation.
