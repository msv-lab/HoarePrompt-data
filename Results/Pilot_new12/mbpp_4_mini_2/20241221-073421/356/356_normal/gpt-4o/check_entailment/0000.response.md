Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string `s` by utilizing the `replace` method to substitute each space (' ') with an empty string (''). The assertions provided demonstrate various scenarios, including multiple spaces and leading spaces, all returning the expected results. Since no edge case has been identified where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, the program is deemed correct.
