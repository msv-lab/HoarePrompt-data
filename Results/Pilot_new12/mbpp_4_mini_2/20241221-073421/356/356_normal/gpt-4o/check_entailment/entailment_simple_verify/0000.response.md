Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement, which is to remove all whitespaces from a string. The `func_1(s)` method uses the `replace` function to remove spaces, and the original assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected across various scenarios. The annotated version of the code also aligns with the original assessment, detailing that the state right before the function call confirms that `s` is a string and mentions that the function returns the string with all spaces removed.

Additionally, no edge cases have been identified that cause the function to fail in meeting the requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate, and the program is deemed correct.
