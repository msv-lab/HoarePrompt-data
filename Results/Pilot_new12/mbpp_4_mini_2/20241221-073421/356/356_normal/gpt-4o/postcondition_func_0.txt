The function accepts a string parameter `s` and returns a new string with all whitespace characters (including spaces) removed. It does not handle or account for leading or trailing whitespace or other types of whitespace like tabs or newlines, which may lead to unexpected results if such characters are present in the input string. The program does not modify the original string `s`, as strings in Python are immutable, but instead creates and returns a new modified string.
