Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the list contains duplicate values. The presence of duplicates should prevent the list from being classified as containing consecutive numbers since consecutive numbers must be unique. For example, the input `[1, 2, 1]` would return `False` according to the assertions, which is correct; however, for a case like `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, the function would incorrectly return `True`, indicating that the numbers are consecutive when they are not. Thus, the logic fails to account for duplicates, leading to incorrect classifications of whether the list contains consecutive numbers or not.
