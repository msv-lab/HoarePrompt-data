You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the provided code meets the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step:

### Problem description:
The goal is to write a python function that checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True

assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False
```

### Analysis:
1. **Empty List**: The function returns `False` for an empty list, which is reasonable since there are no numbers to form a sequence.
   
2. **Consecutive Numbers**: The assertions provided check for:
   - A list with numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, which are consecutive (correctly returns `True`).
   - A list with numbers `1, 2, 3, 5, 6`, where `4` is missing, which is expectedly not consecutive (correctly returns `False`).
   - A list with numbers `1, 2, 1` does not have consecutive unique numbers, so the return is `False` (this is also correct).

### Testing Edge Cases:
Next, we need to think if there are scenarios where the function could potentially fail in checking for consecutive numbers.

- If the list contains non-integer elements (e.g., floats, strings), the code may raise a `TypeError` when trying to subtract non-integer types during the comparison.

- If the input list has negative numbers (e.g., `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]`), the function could return `True` since the increment is by `1`, even though the user might be expecting to check for consecutive natural numbers.

- If the list contains duplicates (e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3]`), the function should return `True` because `1, 2, 3` is a sequence.

### Conclusion:
While the function works for typical cases and the assertions provided, it does not handle non-integer elements and does not clearly define what type of consecutive numbers it is checking (natural numbers vs all integers). Thus, these issues lead to potential cases where it may not perform as intended.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False since the list 'lst' is empty
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers and the list `lst` is not empty.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of consecutive integers without any gaps, and `i` is equal to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating a condition that is always fulfilled within the context of the code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It first checks if the list is empty; if so, it returns False. If the list is not empty, it sorts the list and checks if the integers are consecutive. If any gap is found between consecutive integers in the sorted list, it returns False. If all integers are consecutive, the function returns True. Therefore, the function effectively determines whether the provided list consists entirely of consecutive integers without any gaps. It lacks handling for cases where the list contains duplicates, which could lead to erroneous classifications of non-consecutive integers that are actually consecutive in terms of value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
