The problem description states that we need a Python function to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The function is designed to return `True` if the numbers are consecutive and `False` otherwise. 

Upon reviewing the original code and the test cases provided, the function performs as expected for the examples given. It sorts the list and checks for gaps between numbers, which is correct for identifying consecutive integers.

However, the original assessment deemed the program incorrect because it did not handle negative numbers. The input `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]` indeed contains consecutive integers when considering the full range of integers (negative and positive). While the annotations clarify that the program is designed to handle non-empty lists of integers, they do not explicitly state that the function's behavior for negative integers is flawed. 

Since the assessment notes a specific edge case that the program does not account for, and this edge case is valid according to the problem description (as consecutive numbers can be negative), the original assessment remains accurate. The program does not fulfill the requirements because it would not return `True` for negative consecutive numbers.

Thus, I conclude that the original assessment is justified and accurate, leading to the final determination of the program's correctness.

Final: **False**
