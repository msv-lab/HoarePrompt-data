Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(lst)` is designed to check if the given list `lst` contains consecutive numbers. It first checks if the list is empty and returns `False`, which is appropriate because an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting**: The program sorts the list using `sorted(lst)` to ensure that the numbers are in order. This is crucial for the consecutive number check since the numbers must be in sequential order. 

3. **Consecutive Checking**: The program then iterates through the sorted list (excluding the last element) and checks whether the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly `1`. If any difference is not `1`, it returns `False`, accurately reflecting that the list does not contain consecutive numbers.

4. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding any gaps, the function returns `True`, indicating all numbers were consecutive.

5. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions cover various scenarios:
   - A list with consecutive numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `True`.
   - A list that skips numbers `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` returns `False`.
   - A list with repeated numbers `[1, 2, 1]` also returns `False`, which is consistent, as repeated numbers do not form a sequence.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the logic needed to determine if a list contains consecutive integers, and does so for all tested scenarios.
