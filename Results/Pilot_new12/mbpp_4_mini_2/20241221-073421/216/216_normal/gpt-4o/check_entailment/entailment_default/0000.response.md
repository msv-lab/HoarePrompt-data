The given Python program is designed to check whether a list contains consecutive numbers. Let's analyze the provided code along with the output hints.

### Program Analysis:

1. **Input Check**: 
   - The code first checks if the input list `lst` is empty. If it is, the function correctly returns `False`.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The program sorts the list. Sorting is necessary for checking consecutive numbers effectively.

3. **Consecutive Check**:
   - The program uses a loop to check if each pair of adjacent sorted numbers has a difference of exactly 1, indicating they are consecutive.

4. **Return Values**:
   - The function returns `True` if all numbers are consecutive, and `False` if it finds a gap.

### Output Hints Summary:
The output hints state that the function:
- Returns `True` if the integers are consecutive without gaps.
- Returns `False` if any gap is found or if the list is empty.
- Does not handle duplicates properly, which could affect the assessment of consecutiveness.

### Key Issue Identified:
The primary flaw in the implementation is that it does not account for duplicates. For example:
- If the input list is `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, the sorted list will still be `[1, 2, 2, 3]`. However, the duplicates (the two `2`s) break the condition of being fully consecutive, as `2` is repeated.
- The function would incorrectly return `True` for this case because it only checks for gaps of `1` between different numbers, instead of ensuring there are no duplicates.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to account for lists with duplicates correctly, which means it does not fulfill the problem description in every case. Thus, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.
