Correctness: **False**

The program `func_1` is supposed to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. However, it does not properly handle cases where the list may have duplicates. According to the problem description, for a list to contain consecutive numbers, the integers must be distinct and in a consecutive sequence without any gaps.

The program follows these steps:
1. Checks if the list is empty, returning `False` if it is.
2. Sorts the list.
3. Iterates through the sorted list to check if each number is exactly one greater than the preceding number.
4. Returns `True` if all checks pass, otherwise `False`.

However, the function fails the requirement of being "consecutive" due to its lack of handling for duplicate values. For example, if the input is `[1, 2, 1]`, the sorted version of this list is `[1, 1, 2]`, which leads the program to correctly return `False`. However, if the input is `[1, 2, 3, 3]`, the sorted version will be `[1, 2, 3, 3]`, and the function would return `True`, incorrectly suggesting these numbers are consecutive. 

This shows that the program does not always satisfy the problem description because it can incorrectly classify lists with duplicates as having consecutive numbers. Therefore, the function does not meet the defined requirements in every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is not correct.
