Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identified that the function does not handle certain edge cases related to duplicates and the definition of "consecutive numbers." While the implementation works for a basic set of test cases, the lack of handling for duplicates and its assumption regarding input types mean that it does not meet the problem description's requirement fully. The annotated version supports the assessment by highlighting that while the function successfully returns expected results for provided examples, it lacks robustness in scenarios with duplicates or a lack of clarity on what constitutes "consecutive numbers." Therefore, the function's correctness is limited, and the original assessment of correctness as **False** remains justified.
