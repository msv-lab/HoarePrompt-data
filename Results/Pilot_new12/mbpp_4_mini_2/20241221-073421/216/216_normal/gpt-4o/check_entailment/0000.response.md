To determine if the provided code meets the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step:

### Problem description:
The goal is to write a python function that checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True

assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False
```

### Analysis:
1. **Empty List**: The function returns `False` for an empty list, which is reasonable since there are no numbers to form a sequence.
   
2. **Consecutive Numbers**: The assertions provided check for:
   - A list with numbers `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`, which are consecutive (correctly returns `True`).
   - A list with numbers `1, 2, 3, 5, 6`, where `4` is missing, which is expectedly not consecutive (correctly returns `False`).
   - A list with numbers `1, 2, 1` does not have consecutive unique numbers, so the return is `False` (this is also correct).

### Testing Edge Cases:
Next, we need to think if there are scenarios where the function could potentially fail in checking for consecutive numbers.

- If the list contains non-integer elements (e.g., floats, strings), the code may raise a `TypeError` when trying to subtract non-integer types during the comparison.

- If the input list has negative numbers (e.g., `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]`), the function could return `True` since the increment is by `1`, even though the user might be expecting to check for consecutive natural numbers.

- If the list contains duplicates (e.g., `[1, 2, 2, 3]`), the function should return `True` because `1, 2, 3` is a sequence.

### Conclusion:
While the function works for typical cases and the assertions provided, it does not handle non-integer elements and does not clearly define what type of consecutive numbers it is checking (natural numbers vs all integers). Thus, these issues lead to potential cases where it may not perform as intended.

Correctness: **False**.
