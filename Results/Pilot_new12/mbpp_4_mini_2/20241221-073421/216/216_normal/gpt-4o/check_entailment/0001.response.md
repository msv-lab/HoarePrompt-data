Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the list contains negative numbers. For example, the input `[-3, -2, -1, 0, 1]` contains consecutive numbers in the sequence of integers, but the program would return `False` because it checks for positive consecutive numbers only. Since this is a potential case that the program does not handle correctly, the correctness of the program is deemed false.
