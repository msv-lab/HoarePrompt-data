The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It first checks if the list is empty; if so, it returns False. If the list is not empty, it sorts the list and checks if the integers are consecutive. If any gap is found between consecutive integers in the sorted list, it returns False. If all integers are consecutive, the function returns True. Therefore, the function effectively determines whether the provided list consists entirely of consecutive integers without any gaps. It lacks handling for cases where the list contains duplicates, which could lead to erroneous classifications of non-consecutive integers that are actually consecutive in terms of value.
