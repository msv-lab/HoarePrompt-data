According to the code, the loop executes based on the length of the sorted list `lst_sorted`. The loop will execute as long as `len(lst_sorted) - 1` is greater than 0, which means that `len(lst_sorted)` needs to be at least 2 for the loop to have at least one iteration. Given that `lst` is not empty and `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`, we can confirm that `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute.

At the beginning of the loop, `i` needs to be initialized at 0, as that will be the starting index for the first iteration. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments to the states are:
- `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements, ensuring that the loop can execute.
- `i` will start at 0.

State: **`lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
