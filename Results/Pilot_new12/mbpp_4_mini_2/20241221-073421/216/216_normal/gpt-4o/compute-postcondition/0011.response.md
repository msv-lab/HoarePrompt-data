According to the code, the loop iterates through the indices of the sorted list `lst_sorted` from 0 to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`. The loop variable `i` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased to 2. Additionally, `lst_sorted` must contain at least 4 elements for the index 2 to be valid, which is consistent since it already has at least 3 elements.

Therefore, for the loop to execute once more, the conditions involving the length of the list remain the same, and `i` becomes 2, allowing access to the next pair of elements in the list.

State: **`lst_sorted` has at least 4 elements, `i` is 2**
