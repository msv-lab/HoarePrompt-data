The code `lst_sorted = sorted(lst)` sorts the list `lst`, which is a list of integers and is not empty. The output will be a variable `lst_sorted` that contains the sorted version of `lst`. The original list `lst` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty; `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`.**
