According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop will run as long as there are at least 2 elements in `lst_sorted` and `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and since `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements, it can be inferred that `len(lst_sorted)` is at least 2. For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1, and for the loop to run again, `len(lst_sorted)` must be greater than 2 (so that `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`).

State: **`lst_sorted` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1**
