The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, if `lst` is empty, the function returns `False`. If the difference between the first two elements of the sorted list `lst` is not equal to 1, the function returns `False`. There are two additional cases where the function also returns `False`. Lastly, the function can return `True`, indicating that a condition is satisfied within the context of the code. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return `False` if the list is empty, if the difference between the first two elements (when sorted) is not equal to 1, or for other unspecified conditions, while returning `True` if a specific condition is met.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `False` if `lst` is empty, if the difference between the first two elements of the sorted list is not equal to 1, or for other unspecified conditions. It returns `True` if a certain condition is satisfied.**
