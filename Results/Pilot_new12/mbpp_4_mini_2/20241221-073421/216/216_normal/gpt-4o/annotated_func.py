#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False since the list 'lst' is empty
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers and the list `lst` is not empty.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of consecutive integers without any gaps, and `i` is equal to `len(lst_sorted) - 2`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating a condition that is always fulfilled within the context of the code.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst`. It first checks if the list is empty; if so, it returns False. If the list is not empty, it sorts the list and checks if the integers are consecutive. If any gap is found between consecutive integers in the sorted list, it returns False. If all integers are consecutive, the function returns True. Therefore, the function effectively determines whether the provided list consists entirely of consecutive integers without any gaps. It lacks handling for cases where the list contains duplicates, which could lead to erroneous classifications of non-consecutive integers that are actually consecutive in terms of value.
