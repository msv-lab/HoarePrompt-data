Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. Hereâ€™s the explanation:

1. **Sorting the List**: The function first sorts the input list `lst`. This is important because to check for consecutive numbers, the elements must be in order, so that we can check if each element is exactly 1 greater than the previous element.

2. **Checking Differences**: It uses a generator expression within `all()`, which iterates through the indices of the sorted list to check if the difference between consecutive elements is equal to 1. This ensures that all elements are consecutive.

3. **Checking for Duplicates**: The condition `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` checks if there are any duplicate elements in the list. If there are duplicates, then the elements cannot be consecutive, so this condition is necessary.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if both conditions (consecutiveness and no duplicates) are satisfied, and `False` otherwise.

Overall, the program adheres to the requirements of the problem description, accurately checking for consecutive numbers while properly handling duplicates, hence fulfilling the stated functionality consistently.
