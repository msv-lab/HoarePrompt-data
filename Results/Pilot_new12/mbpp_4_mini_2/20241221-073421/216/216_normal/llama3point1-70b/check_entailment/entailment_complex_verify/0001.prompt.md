You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the code closely.

### Problem Description
The task is to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. Consecutive numbers mean that each number in the sequence increments by 1 from the previous number. 

### Code Analysis
The function provided sorts the list and checks two conditions:
1. It ensures that every subsequent number in the sorted list is exactly 1 greater than the previous number by checking the difference between them.
2. It checks that all numbers are unique by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set of the list.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Empty List**: An empty list should be considered to not contain consecutive numbers because there are no numbers to form a sequence. However, this case must be explicitly considered.
2. **Single Element List**: A list with one element (e.g., `[5]`) should also be considered as not containing consecutive numbers because there is no second number to compare against.
3. **List with Non-Consecutive Elements**: For example, if the list is `[1, 3, 2]`, the sorted list would be `[1, 2, 3]`, which returns `True`, but the original list does not have consecutive elements.
4. **List with Duplicates**: If the list contains duplicates, it should return `False`. For example, `[1, 1, 2]` should return `False`.

### Testing the Code
1. An empty list `[]` → The function would return `True`, which is incorrect per our expectation that it should return `False`.
2. A single element list `[1]` → The function would return `True`, which is also incorrect.
3. A list with duplicates like `[1, 1, 2]` → The function would return `False`, which is correct.
4. A non-consecutive sorted list `[1, 3, 2]` → The function would return `True`, which is also incorrect since based on its original form it’s not consecutive.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the edge cases for empty lists and single-element lists. Therefore, it does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if all consecutive elements in the sorted list 'lst' differ by 1 and if there are no duplicate elements in 'lst', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input. It sorts the list and checks two conditions: first, it verifies if all consecutive integers in the sorted list differ by exactly 1, and second, it checks that there are no duplicate integers in the list. The function returns `True` if both conditions are satisfied and `False` otherwise. It is important to note that if the input list is empty or contains only one element, it will return `False` since there are no consecutive elements to compare. Additionally, while the function does handle duplicate values, it will also return `False` for an empty list or a single-item list, fulfilling these edge cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
