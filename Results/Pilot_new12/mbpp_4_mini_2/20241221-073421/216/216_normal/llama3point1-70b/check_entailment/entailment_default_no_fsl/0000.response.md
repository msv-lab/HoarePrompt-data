Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the case of an empty list and a list with a single element correctly. According to the problem description, it must determine if the list contains consecutive numbers, but the logic implemented treats an empty list or a list with one item as yielding `False`. However, if there are no elements or only one element, there are no consecutive numbers to consider, which doesn't fit the expectation for checking consecutive numbers. 

For example:
- An empty list `[]` should ideally return `False` since there are no numbers.
- A list with one element `[5]` could be considered to not have any consecutive numbers either.

However, if we strictly interpret "consecutive numbers," it could be argued that single and empty lists should return `False` because there are not enough elements to establish a sequence of consecutive numbers.

Nonetheless, more conclusively, the example `func_1([1, 2, 4])` will return `False`, which is correct, but `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `True`, which is correct as well.

To summarize, the function cannot be deemed fully correct, as it does not adequately handle the edge cases as one would expect from a typical definition of consecutive numbers. It misses out on the clarification from the problem description about whether single elements or empty lists should return `False`, confusing potential users. 

Thus, since the program does not meet expectations for every edge case, we conclude that it is incorrect.
