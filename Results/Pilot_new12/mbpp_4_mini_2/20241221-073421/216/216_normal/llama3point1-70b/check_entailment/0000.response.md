To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided function:

### Problem description:
Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list first. 
2. **Consecutive Check**: It uses `all()` to check if each element is consecutive to the previous one by ensuring that `lst[i] - lst[i - 1]` is equal to 1.
3. **Unique Elements**: It also checks that all elements are unique by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set created from the list.

### Points of Concern:
- If the input list is empty (`lst = []`), the function will return `True` because `all()` on an empty iterable evaluates to `True`. However, the problem description does not clarify how to handle empty lists; depending on interpretation, it could be argued that an empty list does not contain consecutive numbers, and therefore the output should be `False`.
- If the input list contains negative numbers, the check will still operate correctly as it will sort and check the differences. However, we commonly consider "consecutive numbers" to mean positive integers (or non-negative), which can lead to ambiguity based on the inputs.
- The function does not terminate correctly if the input contains only one element. For a single element, the output should be `True` if it’s treated as consecutive by itself, but it’s not explicitly handled.
  
### Potential Failure Cases:
- **Empty List**: `func_1([])` returns `True`, but it may be expected to return `False`.
- **Single Element**: `func_1([3])` returns `True`, but it could be argued that one number cannot be considered as "consecutive numbers".
- **Negative Consecutive Numbers**: `func_1([-3, -2, -1])` does produce a valid output (i.e., `True`), but if viewed as positive integers only, the definition of "consecutive numbers" may break.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program fails to clearly define behavior in certain edge cases such as empty lists and lists with a single element.

Correctness: **False**.
