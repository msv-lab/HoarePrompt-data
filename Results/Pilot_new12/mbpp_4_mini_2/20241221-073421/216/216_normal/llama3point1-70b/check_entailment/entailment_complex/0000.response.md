Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

**Explanation:**

1. **Empty List:** The program will return `False` for an empty list, as there are no elements to check for consecutivity. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list. Ideally, if we are checking for consecutive numbers, an empty list could be interpreted ambiguously.

2. **Single Element List:** The program will return `False` for a list containing a single element. While this is reasonable behavior given that you cannot have consecutive numbers with only one element, the problem statement does not clarify this.

3. **Negative or Non-Consecutive Values:** While the program checks for duplicates and consecutive values correctly, it does not explicitly mention how it handles negative integers. For instance, the input `[-1, 0, 1]` is indeed consecutive, but the explanation doesn't explicitly confirm that it works with negative numbers.

4. **Assuming User Input:** The assumption of valid input does not guarantee that the program is correct per the problem statement because it does not indicate how edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists are handled.

In summary, while the program implements a check for consecutive integers correctly, its treatment of edge cases and ambiguity in handling an empty list leads to it not strictly adhering to the problem description. Therefore, it does not always fulfill the requirements as interpreted.
