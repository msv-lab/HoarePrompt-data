To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the code closely.

### Problem Description
The task is to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. Consecutive numbers mean that each number in the sequence increments by 1 from the previous number. 

### Code Analysis
The function provided sorts the list and checks two conditions:
1. It ensures that every subsequent number in the sorted list is exactly 1 greater than the previous number by checking the difference between them.
2. It checks that all numbers are unique by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set of the list.

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **Empty List**: An empty list should be considered to not contain consecutive numbers because there are no numbers to form a sequence. However, this case must be explicitly considered.
2. **Single Element List**: A list with one element (e.g., `[5]`) should also be considered as not containing consecutive numbers because there is no second number to compare against.
3. **List with Non-Consecutive Elements**: For example, if the list is `[1, 3, 2]`, the sorted list would be `[1, 2, 3]`, which returns `True`, but the original list does not have consecutive elements.
4. **List with Duplicates**: If the list contains duplicates, it should return `False`. For example, `[1, 1, 2]` should return `False`.

### Testing the Code
1. An empty list `[]` → The function would return `True`, which is incorrect per our expectation that it should return `False`.
2. A single element list `[1]` → The function would return `True`, which is also incorrect.
3. A list with duplicates like `[1, 1, 2]` → The function would return `False`, which is correct.
4. A non-consecutive sorted list `[1, 3, 2]` → The function would return `True`, which is also incorrect since based on its original form it’s not consecutive.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle the edge cases for empty lists and single-element lists. Therefore, it does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description in all cases.

Correctness: **False**
