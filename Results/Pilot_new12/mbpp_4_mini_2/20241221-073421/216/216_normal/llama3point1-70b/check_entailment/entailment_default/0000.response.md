The provided program sorts the list and checks two conditions: whether all elements in the sorted list are consecutive (differ by exactly 1) and if there are no duplicates (using a set to compare lengths). The output hints suggest that the function will return `True` only if both conditions are satisfied.

However, the output hints state that the function will return `False` for an empty list or a single-item list, which means these cases are not handled correctly per the problem description. The problem statement does not specify that lists with fewer than two elements do not count as containing consecutive numbers; thus, a list with a single number (e.g., `[3]`) could be interpreted as containing that number as a "consecutive" integer by itself.

Thus, the program fails to handle cases where a list contains a single integer or is empty, leading to incorrect behavior.

Correctness: **False**.
