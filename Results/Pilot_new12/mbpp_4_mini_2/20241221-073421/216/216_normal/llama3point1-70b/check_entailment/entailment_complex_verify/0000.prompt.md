You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided function:

### Problem description:
Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting the List**: The program sorts the list first. 
2. **Consecutive Check**: It uses `all()` to check if each element is consecutive to the previous one by ensuring that `lst[i] - lst[i - 1]` is equal to 1.
3. **Unique Elements**: It also checks that all elements are unique by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set created from the list.

### Points of Concern:
- If the input list is empty (`lst = []`), the function will return `True` because `all()` on an empty iterable evaluates to `True`. However, the problem description does not clarify how to handle empty lists; depending on interpretation, it could be argued that an empty list does not contain consecutive numbers, and therefore the output should be `False`.
- If the input list contains negative numbers, the check will still operate correctly as it will sort and check the differences. However, we commonly consider "consecutive numbers" to mean positive integers (or non-negative), which can lead to ambiguity based on the inputs.
- The function does not terminate correctly if the input contains only one element. For a single element, the output should be `True` if it’s treated as consecutive by itself, but it’s not explicitly handled.
  
### Potential Failure Cases:
- **Empty List**: `func_1([])` returns `True`, but it may be expected to return `False`.
- **Single Element**: `func_1([3])` returns `True`, but it could be argued that one number cannot be considered as "consecutive numbers".
- **Negative Consecutive Numbers**: `func_1([-3, -2, -1])` does produce a valid output (i.e., `True`), but if viewed as positive integers only, the definition of "consecutive numbers" may break.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program fails to clearly define behavior in certain edge cases such as empty lists and lists with a single element.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if all consecutive elements in the sorted list 'lst' differ by 1 and if there are no duplicate elements in 'lst', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input. It sorts the list and checks two conditions: first, it verifies if all consecutive integers in the sorted list differ by exactly 1, and second, it checks that there are no duplicate integers in the list. The function returns `True` if both conditions are satisfied and `False` otherwise. It is important to note that if the input list is empty or contains only one element, it will return `False` since there are no consecutive elements to compare. Additionally, while the function does handle duplicate values, it will also return `False` for an empty list or a single-item list, fulfilling these edge cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
