The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, if all consecutive elements in the sorted list `lst` differ by 1 and there are no duplicate elements in `lst`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers and return `True` if the sorted list has consecutive elements that differ by 1 without any duplicates; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, returns `True` if all consecutive elements in the sorted list differ by 1 and there are no duplicates; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
