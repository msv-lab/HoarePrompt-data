Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers as input. It sorts the list and checks two conditions: first, it verifies if all consecutive integers in the sorted list differ by exactly 1, and second, it checks that there are no duplicate integers in the list. The function returns `True` if both conditions are satisfied and `False` otherwise. It is important to note that if the input list is empty or contains only one element, it will return `False` since there are no consecutive elements to compare. Additionally, while the function does handle duplicate values, it will also return `False` for an empty list or a single-item list, fulfilling these edge cases.**
