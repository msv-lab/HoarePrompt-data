#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if all consecutive elements in the sorted list 'lst' differ by 1 and if there are no duplicate elements in 'lst', otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers as input. It sorts the list and checks two conditions: first, it verifies if all consecutive integers in the sorted list differ by exactly 1, and second, it checks that there are no duplicate integers in the list. The function returns `True` if both conditions are satisfied and `False` otherwise. It is important to note that if the input list is empty or contains only one element, it will return `False` since there are no consecutive elements to compare. Additionally, while the function does handle duplicate values, it will also return `False` for an empty list or a single-item list, fulfilling these edge cases.
