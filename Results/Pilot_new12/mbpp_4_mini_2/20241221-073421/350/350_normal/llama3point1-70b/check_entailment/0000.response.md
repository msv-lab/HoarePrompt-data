Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the last index to the first index. If it finds the target element, it returns the current index. If the element is not found by the time the loop finishes, it returns -1. This implementation correctly handles all cases, including:

1. If the target is at the end of the array.
2. If the target is at the beginning of the array.
3. If the target appears multiple times, it returns the index of the last occurrence.
4. If the target is not present in the array, it returns -1.
5. If the array is empty, it correctly returns -1.

Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
