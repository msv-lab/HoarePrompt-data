Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Iterative Search**: The function `func_1` iteratively searches through the array `arr` starting from the last index and moves backwards. This approach effectively allows it to find the last occurrence of the `target` element in a sorted list. 

2. **Return Value**: If the `target` is found, the function immediately returns the index `i`, which corresponds to the last occurrence. If the target is not found after checking all elements, the function returns -1, which is a valid outcome as per the problem description.

3. **Correct Handling of Input**: The function handles a valid input of a list of sorted integers and an integer `target`. As it does not explicitly specify error handling for other cases (like an empty list), it assumes valid input will be provided, as stated in the instructions.

4. **Completeness**: The function correctly fulfills the requirement to return the last position of the element or -1 if it is not found, thereby aligning with the expectations outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, given the implementation aligns with the problem requirements, the correctness of the program can be affirmed as true.
