Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which requires finding the last position of an element (the target) in a sorted array. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Logic for Finding Last Position**: The program iterates through the array `arr` starting from the last element (hence the use of `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`). This ensures that if the target appears multiple times in the sorted array, the loop will return the index of the last occurrence.

2. **Comparison and Return Value**: Inside the loop, it checks if the current element matches the target (`if arr[i] == target:`). If a match is found, it immediately returns the index `i`, which is the index of the last occurrence of the target.

3. **Handling Non-existence of Target**: If the loop completes without finding the target, it reaches the return statement `return -1`, which indicates that the target is not present in the array. This complies with the requirement to return a value even if the target is not found.

4. **Sorted Array Assumption**: The problem statement specifies that the input array is sorted. The solution correctly leverages this property to find the last occurrence in a single pass.

Overall, the program correctly adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description. Thus, it fulfills the task of finding the last position of a specified element in a sorted list.
