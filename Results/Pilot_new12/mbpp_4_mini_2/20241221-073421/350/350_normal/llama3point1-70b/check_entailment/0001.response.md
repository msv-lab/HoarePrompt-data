Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. Here's the reasoning:

1. The function iterates from the end of the array to the beginning, checking each element to see if it matches the target.
2. As soon as it finds an occurrence of the target, it returns the index of that occurrence. Since the iteration starts from the last element, this ensures that the function returns the last occurrence of the target in the array.
3. If the target is not found in the entire array, the function correctly returns -1.

There are several scenarios that the function handles correctly:
- If the target exists multiple times, it returns the index of the last occurrence.
- If the target is not present in the array, it returns -1.
- It correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty array (returning -1) and arrays where the target is at the boundaries (first or last element).

Since it correctly fulfills the problem description for all tested cases and potential edge cases, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
