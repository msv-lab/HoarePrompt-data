The output hints indicate that while the function `func_1` may correctly find the last index of the target in a sorted array, it does not handle the case of an empty input list properly, which could lead to runtime errors. Therefore, the conclusion drawn in the original assessment fails to consider this critical aspect of input handling.

If the list `arr` is empty, the function would not return a valid output, whereas it should ideally return -1 according to the specifications, as there would be no elements to search through.

Since the original assessment did not acknowledge this limitation of the function's behavior with empty inputs, it cannot be deemed as completely correct.

Final: **False**
