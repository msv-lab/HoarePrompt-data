Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not correctly handle the case where the input list `arr` is empty. In such a scenario, attempting to access the index of the list (even though it is checked in the loop) will lead to undefined behavior, such as an index error. In addition, the output hints mention that if the last element is not equal to `target`, the function should simply return -1, which is covered in the code. However, the primary issue remains with the absence of handling for the empty input list; this constitutes a violation of the problem's requirement that it must work correctly for every potential case.

Therefore, since there are cases (like an empty list) where the function could fail or behave incorrectly, the program does not fulfill the problem description adequately.
