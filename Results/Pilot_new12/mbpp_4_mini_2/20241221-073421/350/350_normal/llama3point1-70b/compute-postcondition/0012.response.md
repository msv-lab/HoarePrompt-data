The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of sorted integers, and `target`, which is an integer that may or may not be present in `arr`. 

Based on the provided output scenarios:
- In Case_1, the function returns the index `i`, which is the last index of the list `arr`, given that `arr` contains at least one element.
- In Case_2, the function returns the index `i`, which is `len(arr) - 2`, indicating the position of the second to last element in the list `arr`.
- In Case_3, the function returns `i`, which is calculated as `len(arr) - 3`, implying that the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`.
- In Case_4, the function returns -1, which indicates that the `target` was not found in the list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sorted integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and return the appropriate index based on the conditions outlined above, including handling cases where `target` is not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of sorted integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returning the last index of `arr` if it has at least one element, the index of the second to last element, the index of the third to last element if the last element is not equal to `target`, or -1 if `target` is not found in the list.**
