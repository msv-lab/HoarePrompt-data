According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `len(arr)`. The loop will execute if `arr` has at least one element since it starts from `len(arr) - 1` and goes down to `0`. Therefore, if `arr` is empty (i.e., `len(arr)` is 0), the loop will not execute. 

For the loop to be executed, `arr` must consist of at least 1 sorted integer, and at the beginning, `i` should be initialized to `len(arr) - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
