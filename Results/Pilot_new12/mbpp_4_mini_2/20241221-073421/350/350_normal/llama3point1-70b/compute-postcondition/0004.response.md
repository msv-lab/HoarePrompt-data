According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition defined in the `for` statement. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, meaning it points to the last element of the list. Since the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`, it indicates the loop has not yet found the target value.

In the next iteration, `i` will be decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be `len(arr) - 2`, and the same condition applies to `arr` since it still must contain at least 1 element.

State: **`arr` is a list of sorted integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`.**
