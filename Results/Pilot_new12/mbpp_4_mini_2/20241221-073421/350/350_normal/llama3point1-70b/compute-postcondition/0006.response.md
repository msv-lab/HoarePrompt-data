Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of sorted integers with at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `target`, the program returns index `i`, which is the position of the second to last element in `arr`. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `target`, the program does not return any value.***
