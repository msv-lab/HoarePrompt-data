According to the code, the loop is set to iterate over the indices of the array `arr` from the last index down to the first index (inclusive). The variable `i` is currently `len(arr) - 2`, which means that it is pointing to the second to last element of the list. Since the loop iterates with `i` decreasing by 1 each time, the next value of `i` will be `len(arr) - 3`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, which corresponds to the second to last element in `arr`. Since it's noted that `arr[i]` (the second to last element) is not equal to `target`, the loop does not return any value in this scenario, and the loop must execute once more for `i` to become `len(arr) - 3`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `i` to `len(arr) - 3`.

Taking all of this into account, the next state will be:

State: **`arr` is a list of sorted integers with at least one element, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `target`.**
