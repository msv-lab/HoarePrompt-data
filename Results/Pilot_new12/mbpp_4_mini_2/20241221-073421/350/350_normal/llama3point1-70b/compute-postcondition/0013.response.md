Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of sorted integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It searches for the last occurrence of `target` in `arr` and returns its index. If `target` is found, the function returns the index of the last occurrence; if not found, it returns -1. Importantly, the function does not handle cases for when the input list `arr` is empty, which would lead to an index error or undefined behavior. Besides, the return postconditions suggest incorrect behavior since if the last element isn't equal to `target`, no specific index should be returned other than -1. Thus, the function's output is either the last index of `target` found or -1 if not present.**
