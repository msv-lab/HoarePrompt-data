According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the range defined by `len(arr)`. The loop starts with `i` as `len(arr) - 1` and decrements `i` in each iteration until `i` is no longer greater than or equal to 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 2`. This means that when the loop executes one more time, `i` will be decremented to `len(arr) - 3`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers and has at least 1 integer, we need to ensure that `i` remains within the valid index range.

For the loop to execute again, the following conditions must hold:

1. The loop will execute one more time when `i` is decremented to `len(arr) - 3`.
2. The list `arr` must have at least 3 elements to have a valid index for `i` equal to `len(arr) - 3`.

At this point, since the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x` and `arr[i]` is not equal to `x`, the loop is able to run without returning any value again.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 3 integers, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 3`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`.**
