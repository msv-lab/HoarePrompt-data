Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `x`, the function returns the index `i`, which is equal to the length of the sorted list `arr` minus 3. If `arr[i]` is not equal to `x`, there is no return value.***
