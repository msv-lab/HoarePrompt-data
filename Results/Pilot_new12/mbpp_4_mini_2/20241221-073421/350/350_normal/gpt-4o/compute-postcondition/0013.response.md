Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`. It iterates through the list in reverse order to find the index of the last occurrence of `x`. If `x` is found, the function returns its index. If `x` is not present in the list, the function returns -1. This means the function can return any valid index from 0 to `len(arr) - 1` where `x` is located in `arr`, or -1 if `x` is absent. The function does not account for multiple occurrences of `x`, as it only returns the index of the last occurrence. Edge cases include an empty list, where it correctly returns -1, and a list where `x` is larger than all elements in `arr`, also returning -1.**
