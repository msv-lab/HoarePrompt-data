According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the array `arr` in reverse order, starting from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `arr` must be a list that has at least one integer. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute because `len(arr)` would be `0`, resulting in `range(-1, -1, -1)`, which yields no values.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 1 integer, and before the loop starts, `i` should be set to `len(arr) - 1`, which is the last index of the list.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`**
