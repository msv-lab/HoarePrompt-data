The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `x`. `arr` is a sorted list of integers, and `x` is an integer. The function has multiple return points based on the conditions met:

- Case 1: If a certain condition is met, the function returns the index `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, indicating the position of the current value `x` in the sorted list `arr`.
- Case 2: If another condition is satisfied, it returns `i`, which is equal to `len(arr) - 2`, where `arr` contains at least 1 integer and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`.
- Case 3: If yet another condition is fulfilled, the function returns the index `i`, which is equal to the length of `arr` minus 3.
- Case 4: If none of the above cases are satisfied, the function returns -1, indicating that `x` was not found in the sorted list `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`, and return indices based on the position of `x` in `arr`, or -1 if `x` is not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`, and returns an index within `arr` based on the position of `x` or -1 if `x` is not found.**
