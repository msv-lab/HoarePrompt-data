Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers that has at least 1 integer, `i` is equal to `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`. If `arr[i]` is equal to `x`, the program returns `i`. Otherwise, there is no else part in the code, and the execution proceeds without a return value.***
