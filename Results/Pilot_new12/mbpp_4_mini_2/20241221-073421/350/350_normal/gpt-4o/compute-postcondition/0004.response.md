According to the code, the loop iterates through the indices of `arr` in reverse order, starting from `len(arr) - 1` down to 0. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, which means it points to the last element of `arr`. Since `arr` has at least 1 integer, the loop will iterate one more time with `i` being decremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` should be set to `len(arr) - 2`, which refers to the second-to-last element of `arr`.

Additionally, the given state mentions that the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`, and there is no need to adjust this requirement for executing the loop again.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and the last element of `arr` is not equal to `x`**
