Correctness: **True**

The `func_1` function correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. It iterates through the list in reverse order, ensuring it finds the index of the last occurrence of `x`. 

The provided assertions in the test cases confirm that it operates correctly for the following scenarios:
1. For the input `[1, 2, 3]` and `1`, it returns `0`, which is correct as `1` is at index `0`.
2. For `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and `1`, it returns `2`, which is the last occurrence of `1` in the list.
3. For `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` and `3`, it returns `3`, which correctly indicates the last position of `3`.

The function also handles edge cases appropriately:
- An empty list returns `-1`, indicated by the logic in `return -1` when no occurrences of `x` are found.
- If an element is greater than all elements in the array, the return value will be `-1`, which is the expected output.

As per the problem description and the output hints, the function meets the requirements for all observed potential cases.
