The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array, and I agree with this conclusion based on the problem description and the annotations.

The program logic is well-structured:
- It iterates through the sorted list in reverse order starting from the last index and checks for the target element `x`.
- Upon finding `x`, it returns the index, ensuring that it captures the last occurrence due to the reverse iteration.
- If `x` is not found after completing the loop, it correctly returns -1.

The annotations further clarify that before entering the function, `arr` is validated to be a sorted list of integers and `x` is confirmed to be an integer, which aligns with our assumptions regarding valid input. The state after the loop when returning -1 indicates that the function handles the condition of not finding `x` appropriately.

All assertions provided in the program are validated by the function logic:
- The first assertion confirms that for `arr` as `[1, 2, 3]` with `x` as `1`, the index returned is `0`, which is correct.
- The second checks that in the case of multiple occurrences, the last index (`2` in this case) is returned for `x=1`, which is also correct.
- The third assertion confirms that for `x=3`, it returns the expected index (`3`).

Given the problem description, the implementation accurately meets the requirements and is validated by both the assertions and the annotations. Since the original assessment deemed the function correct based on sound reasoning, I agree with it.

Final: **True**
