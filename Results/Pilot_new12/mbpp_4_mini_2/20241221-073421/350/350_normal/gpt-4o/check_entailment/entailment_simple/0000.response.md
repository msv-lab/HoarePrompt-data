Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly fulfills the requirement of finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(arr, x)` iterates through the sorted array `arr` from the last index to the first. If it finds an element that matches `x`, it immediately returns the current index. This ensures that the last position (the last occurrence) of `x` is found, as it searches in reverse. 

2. **Return Values**: If `x` is found, its last occurrence index is returned. If `x` is not found in the array, the function returns -1, indicating the absence of the element. This behavior aligns with the problem description, which implicitly requires the function to denote when an element is not found.

3. **Input Assumptions**: The problem description states that the input will be valid, which means we can assume that `arr` will always be a sorted list of integers and `x` will be an integer. Therefore, the function's handling of these types is appropriate and doesn't need error checking.

4. **Comprehensiveness**: The program has been tested with various assertions, which cover cases where the element is present at the beginning, at the end, and multiple occurrences in the list, demonstrating that it correctly returns the last position for different scenarios.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem's requirements, correctly locating the last occurrence of the specified element in a sorted array.
