Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. It iterates through the array in reverse order, starting from the last index and moving towards the first. The first time it finds an element that matches `x`, it returns the index. If `x` is not found in the array, it returns -1.

The assertions demonstrate its correctness for various scenarios including:
- When the element is the first element in the array, it correctly returns the starting index.
- When the element appears multiple times, it finds and returns the last occurrence (last index).
- It also effectively handles cases where the element is not present by returning -1.

The implementation handles all edge cases concerning the input examples provided in the assertions, and no issues are present when analyzing potential cases. Thus, the code behaves as expected according to the problem description.
