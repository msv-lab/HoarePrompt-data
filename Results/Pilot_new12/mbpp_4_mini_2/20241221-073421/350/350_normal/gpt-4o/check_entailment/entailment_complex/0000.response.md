Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(arr, x)` is designed to find the last position (index) of the element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. This functionality aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Iteration Method**: The function uses a reverse for loop to iterate through the array from the last index to the first. This allows the function to find the last occurrence of `x` effectively. When it encounters `x`, it immediately returns the index.

3. **Return Values**: 
   - If `x` is found, the function returns the index of its last occurrence.
   - If `x` is not found in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`, indicating that `x` is not present.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The implementation handles edge cases well:
   - If the array `arr` is empty, the for loop does not execute, and the function will return `-1` as expected.
   - If `x` is less than the smallest element or greater than the largest element in the array, the function will also return `-1` since it will not find `x` after looping through the array.

The program is efficient and adheres to the stated requirements. The assertions at the beginning validate that the function behaves as expected for several test cases, ensuring confidence in its correctness. Thus, the implementation is accurate and functions correctly as per the problem description.
