You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 1) == 0
assert func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 2
assert func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3) == 3

def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element `x` in a sorted array `arr`. It iterates through the array in reverse order, starting from the last index and moving towards the first. The first time it finds an element that matches `x`, it returns the index. If `x` is not found in the array, it returns -1.

The assertions demonstrate its correctness for various scenarios including:
- When the element is the first element in the array, it correctly returns the starting index.
- When the element appears multiple times, it finds and returns the last occurrence (last index).
- It also effectively handles cases where the element is not present by returning -1.

The implementation handles all edge cases concerning the input examples provided in the assertions, and no issues are present when analyzing potential cases. Thus, the code behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`. It iterates through the list in reverse order to find the index of the last occurrence of `x`. If `x` is found, the function returns its index. If `x` is not present in the list, the function returns -1. This means the function can return any valid index from 0 to `len(arr) - 1` where `x` is located in `arr`, or -1 if `x` is absent. The function does not account for multiple occurrences of `x`, as it only returns the index of the last occurrence. Edge cases include an empty list, where it correctly returns -1, and a list where `x` is larger than all elements in `arr`, also returning -1.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
