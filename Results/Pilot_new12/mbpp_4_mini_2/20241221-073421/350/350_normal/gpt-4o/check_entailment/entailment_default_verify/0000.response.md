Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1` identifies the last position of an element in a sorted array. The assertions provided effectively demonstrate that the function behaves as intended in various scenarios, matching the expected outcomes outlined in the problem description. The output hints reinforce this correctness by clarifying that the function is designed to return the last index of a specified element or -1 if the element is not present, without any indication of failure in handling the expected input types. Thus, the function's adherence to the problem requirements and the supportive output hints confirm its overall correctness.
