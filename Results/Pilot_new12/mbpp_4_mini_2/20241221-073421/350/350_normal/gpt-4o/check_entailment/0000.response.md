Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, checking for the target value. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different scenarios:

1. For the array `[1, 2, 3]` and target `1`, the last position is `0`, which is correct.
2. For the array `[1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4]` and target `1`, the last position is `2`, which is also correct as it is the last occurrence of `1`.
3. For the array `[2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9]` and target `3`, the last position is `3`, which aligns with the expected outcome.

The function handles the edge cases of multiple occurrences of the target as well as the case where the target may not exist in the array (it returns `-1` for missing elements). Overall, the function adheres to the problem description for all tested cases, confirming its correctness.
