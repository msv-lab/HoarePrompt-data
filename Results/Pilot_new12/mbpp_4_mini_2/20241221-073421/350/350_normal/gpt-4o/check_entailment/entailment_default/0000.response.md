The program's goal is to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The implementation provided iterates through the list in reverse order to locate the last occurrence of the specified element `x`.

Examining the code:

1. It starts iterating from the last index of the array and moves backwards.
2. If it finds an instance where the element at the current index matches `x`, it returns that index immediately.
3. If the loop completes without finding `x`, it returns `-1`, indicating that `x` is not present in the array.

The output hints clarify that the function indeed iterates in reverse and provides the correct index of the last occurrence of `x`, or returns `-1` if `x` isn't present.

Let's evaluate the edge cases:
- An empty list will correctly return `-1`.
- If `x` is larger than all elements in `arr`, it will correctly return `-1`, because it won't find it in the list.
- It handles lists where `x` is present multiple times appropriately, returning the index of the last appearance.

All the example assertions provided in the code are validated by the logic employed in the function and fulfill the problem's requirements without missing any potential cases.

Since the code adheres closely to the problem description regarding the last position lookup behavior in sorted arrays, and since all tested examples align with that functionality:

Correctness: **True**.
