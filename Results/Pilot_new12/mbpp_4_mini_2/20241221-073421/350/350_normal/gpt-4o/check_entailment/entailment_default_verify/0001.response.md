Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` meets the problem description by correctly finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. The output hints affirm that the function efficiently locates the index of the last occurrence of `x`, returning -1 when `x` is not present. The assertions provided in the program further demonstrate the function's correctness across various scenarios, including edge cases. Thus, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description.
