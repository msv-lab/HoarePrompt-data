You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 1) == 0
assert func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 2
assert func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3) == 3

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers and x is an integer.
def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is -1 indicating `x` was not found, and `x` is not present in the list `arr`.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1 indicating that x was not found in the sorted list of integers arr.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `x`. It iterates through the list in reverse order to find the index of the last occurrence of `x`. If `x` is found, the function returns its index. If `x` is not present in the list, the function returns -1. This means the function can return any valid index from 0 to `len(arr) - 1` where `x` is located in `arr`, or -1 if `x` is absent. The function does not account for multiple occurrences of `x`, as it only returns the index of the last occurrence. Edge cases include an empty list, where it correctly returns -1, and a list where `x` is larger than all elements in `arr`, also returning -1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
