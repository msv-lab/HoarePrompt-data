The provided program defines a function `func_1` that multiplies all numbers in a given list and divides the result by the length of that list. However, it does not handle the case when the input list is empty, which is a critical issue since a division by zero will occur if an empty list is passed to the function. 

The original assessment correctly points out this flaw: it specifies that the function fails when it encounters an empty list, leading to a division by zero error, which means the program does not fulfill the problem description as outlined. 

Furthermore, the output hints clarify that the function is designed to handle a non-empty list and that it calculates an average of the product of the elements. This assumption aligns with the original assessment, reinforcing the conclusion that the function's correctness is compromised due to the lack of handling for empty input.

Given this consistent reasoning and the clear identification of a failure case in the original assessment, the program cannot be deemed correct.

Final: **False**
