The original assessment posits that the function `func_1` contains a flaw due to its failure to handle an empty input list, which would result in a division by zero error. However, the annotations provided state that "numbers is a list of numbers, and the list is not empty" prior to the function call, indicating that we assume valid input will always be provided to the function. This implies that the function should work correctly in contexts where it is guaranteed that the input will not be empty.

Given that the annotations confirm that the inputs will be valid and acknowledge that the cases used in the assertions do not include an empty list, the assessment's concern about the function not handling empty inputs becomes somewhat moot â€“ it is predicated on an assumption that is no longer valid in the context specified by the annotations.

Furthermore, the function computes the product of the input values and divides by the length, as per the problem description, and successfully handles cases of positive and negative integers, as verified by the assertions. 

The conclusion drawn from the annotations suggests that the program meets the problem requirements under the condition of receiving valid input. Thus, the original assessment should be updated to reflect this understanding.

Final: **True**
