Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately identifies that the function `func_1` computes the product of numbers in a list and divides by the length of that list. The provided annotations clarify that the function operates under the assumption of a non-empty list, confirming that it correctly handles conditions for valid input scenarios as per the problem description. 

The annotations specifically state that the function assumes the input will not be empty and that it will not encounter division by zero, which aligns with the assessment that recognizes the intended behavior of the function and the controlled input conditions. Thus, the function behaves correctly given that its inputs are as specified, leading to the conclusion that the overall function satisfies the problem description requirements.
