To verify the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to analyze whether the `func_1` function correctly multiplies all numbers in the input list (or tuple) and then divides the result by the length of that list. 

The relevant points to consider are:

1. The input can be either a list or tuple, and the function should handle both cases.
2. The function must correctly compute the product of all numbers.
3. It must then divide the product by the total count of numbers in the input.
4. The function should handle edge cases, including:
   - An empty input list or tuple.
   - Mixing of positive and negative numbers, as well as zeros, which will impact the product. 

Now letâ€™s evaluate the code:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
```

### Edge Cases:

1. **Empty List:** 
   If the input list is empty, `len(numbers)` would be `0`, which would lead to a division by zero error. Thus, the function is incorrect for this case.

2. **List with Zero:** 
   If the list contains a zero (e.g., `[1, 2, 0]`), the product will be `0`, and dividing `0` by the length of the list will yield `0`, which may or may not align with the intended operation for the problem, depending on interpretation.

3. **Negative and Positive Numbers:** 
   Although the examples provided in the assertions do cover various scenarios, the fundamental logic does not inherently check for some conditions that could bias results in different contexts.

Given the issue with handling an empty list, we can conclude that there is at least one case where the program does not behave as expected.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The provided function does not handle the edge case of an empty list correctly, which will cause a division by zero error.
