Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input list may contain zero. If the list contains a zero, the product will be zero, and dividing by the length of the list will always yield zero, which does not match an expectation of averaging the product of elements. For instance, for `func_1([0, 2, 3])`, the function will return `0`, which does not represent the product of the non-zero numbers divided by their count. This behavior contradicts the implicit expectation of the problem description where the result should reflect the average of the products. Therefore, since the program doesn't meet the requirement for every potential case, it is considered incorrect.
