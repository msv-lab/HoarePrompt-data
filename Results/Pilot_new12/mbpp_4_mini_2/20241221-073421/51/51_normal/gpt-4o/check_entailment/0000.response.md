Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should multiply all the numbers in a list and divide by the length of the list. If an empty list is provided, it will cause a division by zero error when attempting to compute `result = product / len(numbers)`, since `len(numbers)` would be 0. This would result in an exception rather than the expected behavior, thus the program does not work correctly for this potential case.
