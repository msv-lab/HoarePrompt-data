Explanation: The code initially seems to accomplish the task as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the product of all numbers in the provided list and then divides that product by the length of the list to compute the average of the product. However, the output hints identify a critical issue: while the code multiplies all elements in a list, it doesn't correctly handle multiplication with zero. Any list containing zero would result in a product of zero, leading to an average of zero regardless of the other numbers, thus deviating from the intuitive expectation of how an average should react with multiplication and potentially misleading results. Additionally, if only negative numbers are multiplied, the output can be misleading when interpreted as an average product.

Therefore, the function does not behave as expected for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
