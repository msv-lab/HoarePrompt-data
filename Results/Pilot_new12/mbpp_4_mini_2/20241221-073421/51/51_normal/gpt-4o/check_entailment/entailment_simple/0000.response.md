Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(numbers)` accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is expected to be a non-empty list or tuple of numbers.

2. **Multiplication of Elements**: It initializes a variable `product` to 1 and iterates through each number in the `numbers` collection, multiplying them together. At the end of this loop, `product` holds the product of all the numbers.

3. **Division by Length**: After computing the product, it divides this product by the length of the `numbers` list using `len(numbers)`, which effectively implements the requirement of the problem to multiply all the numbers in the list and divide this product by the length of the list.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the computed result, aligning perfectly with the output expected by the problem description.

5. **Assertions**: The three assertions provided are valid test cases, and they check that the output of the function for various inputs matches the expected results with a relative tolerance.

Overall, the program adheres to the specifications given in the problem description, achieves the intended computation without any error or omission, and handles the expected input of valid and non-empty lists. Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
