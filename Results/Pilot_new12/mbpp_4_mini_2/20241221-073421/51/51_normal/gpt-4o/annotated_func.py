#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers, and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is equal to the product of all elements in the `numbers` list, `numbers` is a non-empty list of numbers.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the result, which is equal to the product of all elements in the 'numbers' list divided by the length of 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers and computes the average of the products of all elements in the list. It achieves this by first calculating the product of all the elements in the list and then dividing that product by the number of elements (length) in the list. The function returns this computed average product. However, the function assumes that the input list will be non-empty, and it does not handle cases where the list may contain zero or negative numbers, which could lead to unexpected output or behavior.
