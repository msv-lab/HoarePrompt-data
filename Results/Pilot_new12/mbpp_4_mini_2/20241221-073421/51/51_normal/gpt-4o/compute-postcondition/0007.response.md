The loop calculates the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list and stores it in `product`. The loop will execute once for each element in the non-empty list. If `numbers` contains `k` elements, then `product` will be the multiplication of all `k` elements in the list.

Output State: **`product` is equal to the product of all elements in the `numbers` list, `numbers` is a non-empty list of numbers.**
