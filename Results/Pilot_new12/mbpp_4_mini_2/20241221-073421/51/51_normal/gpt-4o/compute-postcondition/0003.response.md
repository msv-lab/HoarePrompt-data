According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list contains more elements, the loop will execute again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `product` is equal to `num`, where `num` is the first element of the non-empty `numbers` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must now be the second element of the list, and `product` will remain equal to this new `num`. Therefore, if `numbers` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again with `num` being the second element.

State: **`product` is equal to the second element of the `numbers` list, `num` is the second element in the list, `numbers` must have at least 2 elements.**
