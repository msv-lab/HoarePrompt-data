The value of `product` is multiplied by `num`. Since `product` is already equal to `num` squared, the new value of `product` becomes `num` squared multiplied by `num`, which is `num` cubed. The initial state of `num` being the third element in the list and `numbers` containing at least three elements does not change. Therefore, the output state is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `num` cubed, `num` is the third element in the list, and `numbers` must have at least 3 elements.**
