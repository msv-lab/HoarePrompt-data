The `product` variable is updated by multiplying its current value by `num`, which is the second element in the `numbers` list. Given that `product` is equal to `num`, the multiplication results in `product` being squared. Since both values refer to the second element of the `numbers` list, the output state will reflect that `product` is now equal to `num` squared.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `num` squared, `num` is the second element in the list, and `numbers` must have at least 2 elements.**
