Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers and computes the average of the products of all elements in the list. It achieves this by first calculating the product of all the elements in the list and then dividing that product by the number of elements (length) in the list. The function returns this computed average product. However, the function assumes that the input list will be non-empty, and it does not handle cases where the list may contain zero or negative numbers, which could lead to unexpected output or behavior.**
