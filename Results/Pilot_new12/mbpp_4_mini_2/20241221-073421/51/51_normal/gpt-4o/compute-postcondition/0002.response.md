The value of `product` is updated by multiplying it with `num`. Since `product` starts at 1 and `num` is the first element from the non-empty `numbers` list, `product` now becomes equal to `num`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `num`, where `num` is the first element from the non-empty `numbers` list.**
