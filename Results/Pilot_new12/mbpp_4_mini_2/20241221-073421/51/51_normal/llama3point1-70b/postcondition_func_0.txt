The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers (integers or floats) and calculates the average of the product of those numbers divided by the count of numbers in the list. It calculates the product by multiplying all elements in the input list, then divides this product by the length of the list to determine the average product per element. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the elements are zero or if the input list contains non-numeric types, which could lead to incorrect behavior or exceptions. It assumes that all elements in the input list are numeric.
