#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats) and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is equal to the product of all numbers in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a non-empty list of numbers, and `num` is the last number in the list.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average product per element in the list 'numbers', calculated as product divided by the number of elements in 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers (integers or floats) and calculates the average of the product of those numbers divided by the count of numbers in the list. It calculates the product by multiplying all elements in the input list, then divides this product by the length of the list to determine the average product per element. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the elements are zero or if the input list contains non-numeric types, which could lead to incorrect behavior or exceptions. It assumes that all elements in the input list are numeric.
