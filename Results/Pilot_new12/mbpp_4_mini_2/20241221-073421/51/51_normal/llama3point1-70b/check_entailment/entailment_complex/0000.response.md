Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers (either integers or floats) and performs the following steps:

1. It initializes a variable `product` with the value `1`.
2. It iterates over each number in the provided list `numbers`, multiplying them together to calculate the total product.
3. After the loop, it divides the calculated product by the length of the list, which yields the average product per element in the list.

This aligns perfectly with the requirement to "multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list." 

The assumptions made in the annotations (that the input will always be a non-empty list of numeric values) allow the program to focus solely on the calculation without handling potential exceptions or errors, which adheres to the problem specifications.

Thus, considering the function performs as per the problem description without any omissions or logical errors, the correctness of the function remains intact.
