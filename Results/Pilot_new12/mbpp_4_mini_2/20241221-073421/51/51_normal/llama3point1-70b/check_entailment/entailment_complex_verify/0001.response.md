The annotated version of the code clarifies that the function `func_1` is expected to handle a non-empty list of numbers, as it states that the program starts with the assumption that `numbers` is not empty. It correctly performs the multiplication of all the elements in the list and computes the average product by dividing the product by the length of the list.

However, the original assessment noted the absence of error handling for an empty list, resulting in a `ZeroDivisionError`, which is indeed a valid concern if we were to test the function with an empty list. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that the annotations indicate that the function is assumed to be called with a valid (non-empty) list. 

In this context, where it is stated that valid inputs will not lead to errors, the original assessment regarding the program's correctness may not fully align with the revised understanding of the requirements. Given that the primary function of the program—to compute the average product of a non-empty list—is correctly implemented per its annotations, we can conclude that the original assessment is overly critical because it evaluated it against a situation that would not occur under the stated assumptions. 

Therefore, taking all factors into account, particularly the assumptions made in the annotated version, the program functions as intended except for the noted edge case, which will not arise under valid input conditions.

Final: **True**
