Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. In such a scenario, it will attempt to divide by zero (`len(numbers)` would be 0), leading to a division by zero error. This behavior does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description that the function should be robust for all potential cases, including an empty input list. The output hints also confirm that the function assumes a non-empty list, which directly contradicts the problem description that implies it should work for any valid input, including the empty list. Hence, the initial assessment of the program's correctness as **False** stands validated.
