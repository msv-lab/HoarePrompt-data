The original assessment indicates that the program is incorrect due to not handling the case of an empty list, which would lead to a division by zero error. This is supported by the statement that the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

However, the annotated version of the code explicitly states that the program assumes the input list is not empty at the time of execution, which aligns with the point made that we are assuming the input provided will be valid. Under this assumption, the program correctly calculates the product of all numbers in a non-empty list and divides it by the length of the list, fulfilling the problem's requirements.

Given this perspective, while the original assessment highlights a legitimate concern regarding empty lists, it misapplies the assessment in the context of the provided annotations which indicate non-empty inputs.

Thus, based on the problem description, the annotated state of the code, and the assumptions given, I conclude that the program meets the requirements.

Final: **True**
