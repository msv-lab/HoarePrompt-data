You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze its functionality based on the problem description, which states to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide the result by the length of the list.

Let's break down the program:

1. The `func_1` function takes a list of numbers as input.
2. It initializes `product` to 1.
3. It multiplies each number in the list with `product`.
4. Finally, it returns the `product` divided by the length of the list.

We'll consider a few edge cases to verify the correctness of this function:

### Edge Case 1: Empty List
If the input list is empty (`[]`), the length of the list would be zero. Doing a division by zero will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is a potential failure case.

### Edge Case 2: List with One Element
If the list contains a single element, for example `[5]`, the product will be `5`, and the length is `1`. The division will result in `5 / 1 = 5`, which is correct.

### Edge Case 3: List with Zero
If the list contains a zero, such as `[0, 1, 2]`, the product will be `0`, and the division will be `0 / 3 = 0`, which is still correct.

After considering these edge cases, it is clear that the program does not handle the empty list case, which means it will fail to execute without raising an exception. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
The program does not handle the case of an empty list correctly and will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which violates the requirement to process all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats) and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is equal to the product of all numbers in the list `numbers`, `numbers` is a non-empty list of numbers, and `num` is the last number in the list.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average product per element in the list 'numbers', calculated as product divided by the number of elements in 'numbers'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
