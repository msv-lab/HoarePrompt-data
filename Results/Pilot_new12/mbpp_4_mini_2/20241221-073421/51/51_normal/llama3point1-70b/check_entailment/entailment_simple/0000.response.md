Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which requests a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide by the length of that list. 

Here's why the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Multiplication of All Numbers**: The program initializes a variable `product` to 1 and iterates through each number in the `numbers` list, multiplying each number with `product`. After the loop, `product` holds the product of all numbers in the list.

2. **Division by Length of the List**: After computing the product of all numbers, the program divides `product` by the length of `numbers` using `len(numbers)`. 

3. **Returned Value**: The function directly returns the result of the division which is precisely what is stated in the problem: multiplying all the numbers and then dividing by the count of those numbers.

Thus, the program fulfills the requirement as it correctly computes the average product per element. It efficiently handles the expected input, which is a non-empty list of numbers, and maintains the correct operations as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is correct.
