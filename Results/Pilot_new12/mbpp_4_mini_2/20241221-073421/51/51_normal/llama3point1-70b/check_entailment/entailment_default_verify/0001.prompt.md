You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze its functionality based on the problem description, which states to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide the result by the length of the list.

Let's break down the program:

1. The `func_1` function takes a list of numbers as input.
2. It initializes `product` to 1.
3. It multiplies each number in the list with `product`.
4. Finally, it returns the `product` divided by the length of the list.

We'll consider a few edge cases to verify the correctness of this function:

### Edge Case 1: Empty List
If the input list is empty (`[]`), the length of the list would be zero. Doing a division by zero will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is a potential failure case.

### Edge Case 2: List with One Element
If the list contains a single element, for example `[5]`, the product will be `5`, and the length is `1`. The division will result in `5 / 1 = 5`, which is correct.

### Edge Case 3: List with Zero
If the list contains a zero, such as `[0, 1, 2]`, the product will be `0`, and the division will be `0 / 3 = 0`, which is still correct.

After considering these edge cases, it is clear that the program does not handle the empty list case, which means it will fail to execute without raising an exception. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
The program does not handle the case of an empty list correctly and will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which violates the requirement to process all potential cases as described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers (integers or floats) and calculates the average of the product of those numbers divided by the count of numbers in the list. It calculates the product by multiplying all elements in the input list, then divides this product by the length of the list to determine the average product per element. The function does not explicitly handle cases where the elements are zero or if the input list contains non-numeric types, which could lead to incorrect behavior or exceptions. It assumes that all elements in the input list are numeric.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
