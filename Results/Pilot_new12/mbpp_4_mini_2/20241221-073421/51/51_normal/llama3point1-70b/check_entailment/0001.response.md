To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze its functionality based on the problem description, which states to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide the result by the length of the list.

Let's break down the program:

1. The `func_1` function takes a list of numbers as input.
2. It initializes `product` to 1.
3. It multiplies each number in the list with `product`.
4. Finally, it returns the `product` divided by the length of the list.

We'll consider a few edge cases to verify the correctness of this function:

### Edge Case 1: Empty List
If the input list is empty (`[]`), the length of the list would be zero. Doing a division by zero will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is a potential failure case.

### Edge Case 2: List with One Element
If the list contains a single element, for example `[5]`, the product will be `5`, and the length is `1`. The division will result in `5 / 1 = 5`, which is correct.

### Edge Case 3: List with Zero
If the list contains a zero, such as `[0, 1, 2]`, the product will be `0`, and the division will be `0 / 3 = 0`, which is still correct.

After considering these edge cases, it is clear that the program does not handle the empty list case, which means it will fail to execute without raising an exception. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
The program does not handle the case of an empty list correctly and will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which violates the requirement to process all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
