Correctness: **False**.

The provided function does not correctly handle the case when the input list is empty. If `numbers` is an empty list, the program will attempt to divide by `len(numbers)`, which is zero, leading to a division by zero error. Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.
