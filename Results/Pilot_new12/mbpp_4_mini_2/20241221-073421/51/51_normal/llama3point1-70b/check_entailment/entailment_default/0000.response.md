Explanation: The provided code correctly follows the problem description of multiplying all the numbers in a list and then dividing by the length of the list. The function `func_1` takes a non-empty list of numbers, multiplies them, and computes the average product by dividing that product by the count of numbers in the list. However, the output hints suggest that the code does not handle cases where the elements are zero or if the input list contains non-numeric types. While we assume the input to be valid, which means guaranteed numeric types, the specific mention of zero could still highlight a potential pitfall: if the product becomes zero due to any element being zero, the result will always be zero, which might not be the intended average product of non-zero values for a user expecting meaningful results. Since the description does not explicitly state that it should produce meaningful outputs even when one or more elements are zero, and the hints highlight a critical edge case without directly stating how it should be handled, we conclude that the provided program does not meet the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
