Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to calculate the product of all numbers in a list and then divide this product by the length of the list. However, there are some issues with the implementation that affect its correctness:

1. If any number in the list is zero, the product will be zero, and thus the average product will always result in zero, which does not represent the average correctly unless the input is [0]. This does not align with the intent of averaging meaningful products.
   
2. The program does not check for non-numeric types in the input list, which could lead to TypeError during multiplication. If a non-numeric element (like a string) is included in the list, it would cause the program to throw an error instead of being handled gracefully.

Thus, there are potential cases, such as a list containing zero or non-numeric types, where the program does not work correctly. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
