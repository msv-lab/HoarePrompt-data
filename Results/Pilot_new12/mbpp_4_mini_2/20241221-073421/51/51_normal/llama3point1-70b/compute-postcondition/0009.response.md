The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of numbers (either integers or floats) and the list is not empty. After executing the function body, the function calculates the average product per element in the list 'numbers', which is defined as the product of all the elements in the list divided by the number of elements in 'numbers'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty list of numbers and return the average product per element. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers and returns the average product per element calculated as the product of all elements divided by the number of elements in the list.**
