According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has at least 3 numbers, the loop can execute again for the third number in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` still has at least 2 numbers, and `num` is currently the second number in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `numbers` must have at least 3 numbers, `num` will be the third number in the list.

State: **`product` is equal to the previous value of `product` multiplied by the second number in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 3 numbers, `num` is the third number in the list.**
