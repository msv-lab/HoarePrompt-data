The variable `product` is assigned the value `1`. The initial state indicates that `numbers` is a non-empty list of numbers (either integers or floats), but its specific content does not change due to this line of code. 

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats) and the list is not empty; `product` is 1**.
