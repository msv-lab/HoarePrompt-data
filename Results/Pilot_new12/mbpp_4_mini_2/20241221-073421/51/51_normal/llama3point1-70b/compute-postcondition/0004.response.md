The variable `product` is updated by multiplying its current value with `num`. Since `num` is specified to be the second number in the list `numbers`, this means `product` will now hold the value of the product of its previous value and the specific value of `num`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`product` is equal to the previous value of `product` multiplied by the second number in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that still must have at least 2 numbers, `num` is the second number in the list.**
