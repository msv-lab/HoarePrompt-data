According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. Since the list is stated to be not empty, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `product` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the state of `num` should be adjusted to the first number in the list, and the iteration should start with `num` being the first element of `numbers`. 

State: **`product` is 1, `numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `num` is the first number in the list**
