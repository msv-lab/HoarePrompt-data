`product` is multiplied by `num`. The initial value of `product` is 1, and `num` is the first number in the list `numbers`. Therefore, the new value of `product` will be equal to `1 * num`, which is just `num`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that is not empty, `num` is the first number in the list**
