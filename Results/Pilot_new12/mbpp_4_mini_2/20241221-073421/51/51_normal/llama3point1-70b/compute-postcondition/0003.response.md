According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `numbers` list. If the list has more elements, the loop can execute again with the next number. At the end of the last iteration, `numbers` is not empty, `num` is the first number in the list, and `product` is equal to `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, the `numbers` list must have at least 2 numbers, and since `num` is currently the first number in the list, it will change to the second number in the next iteration.

State: **`product` is equal to `num`, `numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 2 numbers, `num` is the second number in the list**
