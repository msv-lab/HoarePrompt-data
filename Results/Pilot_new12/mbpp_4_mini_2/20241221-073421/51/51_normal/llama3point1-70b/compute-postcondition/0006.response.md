The value of `product` is multiplied by `num`, which is the third number in the `numbers` list. Since `product` is equal to the previous value of `product` multiplied by the second number in `numbers`, its new value will be `previous_product * second_number * num`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`product` is equal to the previous value of `product` multiplied by `second_number` and `num`; `numbers` is a list of at least 3 numbers; `num` is the third number in the list.**
