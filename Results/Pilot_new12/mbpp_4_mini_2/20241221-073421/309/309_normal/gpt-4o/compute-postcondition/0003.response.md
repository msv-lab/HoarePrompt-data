The code assigns the first character of the string `s` to the variable `first_char`. Since the length of `s` is at least 1 and `s` is not an empty string, `first_char` will now hold the first character of `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string with a length of at least 1, `first_char` is the first character of `s`**
