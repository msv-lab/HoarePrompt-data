According to the code, the loop executes for each character in the string `s`. The loop continues as long as there are more characters in `s` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has a length of at least 1, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is also the first character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` must be considered. 

If `s` has a length of at least 1, the first iteration would process the first character, and upon the next iteration, `char` will take the value of the second character in the string. Therefore, `char` will need to be updated to be the second character of `s`, and for more iterations to continue, the length of the string `s` has to be at least 2.

State: **`s` is a string with a length of at least 2, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`.**
