According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least 1 character, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `first_char` is already defined as the first character of `s`, ensuring that it corresponds to the current state of `s`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the string must remain unchanged, and the `char` variable will start by being the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a string with a length of at least 1, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s`**
