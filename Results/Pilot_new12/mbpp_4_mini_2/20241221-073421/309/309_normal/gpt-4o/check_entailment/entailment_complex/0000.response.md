Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which states that the function must check whether all characters in the given string are the same.

Here's an explanation of how the program works according to the problem description:

1. **Empty String Handling**: The function first checks if the input string `s` is empty. If it is, the function returns `True`. This aligns with the reasoning that an empty string can be considered as having all the same characters (since there are no characters to compare).

2. **Character Comparison**: For non-empty strings, the function establishes the first character of the string (`first_char`). It then iterates through each character in the string to check if any character differs from `first_char`. 
   - If any character does not match `first_char`, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all characters in the string are the same.
   - If the loop completes (meaning all characters matched `first_char`), the function returns `True`, confirming that all characters are the same.

3. **Testing**: The provided assertions check various cases:
   - For the input `'python'`, the function correctly returns `False` because the characters are not all the same.
   - For the input `'aaa'`, it returns `True`, as all characters are 'a'.
   - For the input `'data'`, it again returns `False` since there are differing characters.

The program does not handle non-string types, but the problem description assumes the input will always be a valid string. Therefore, since `func_1` correctly addresses the primary requirement of checking character uniformity, it performs as specified by the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
