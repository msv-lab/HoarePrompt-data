Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to check whether all characters in a given string are the same or not. Here's an explanation of how the program achieves this:

1. **Input Handling**: The program function `func_1(s)` checks for any string input `s`, including the case when `s` is an empty string.
  
2. **Logic for Same Characters**:
   - If the input string is empty, the function returns `True`. This decision is reasonable coding practice in this context because an empty string can be considered as having "the same character" since there are no differing characters present.
   - After the initial check for an empty string, the function assigns the first character of the string to `first_char`. It then iterates through each character of the string:
     - If any character is found to be different from `first_char`, the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all characters are the same.
     - If the loop completes without finding any differing characters, the function returns `True`.

3. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided before the function definition validate the correctness of the logic:
   - `assert func_1('python') == False`: This tests a string with different characters, which should return `False`.
   - `assert func_1('aaa') == True`: This tests a string where all characters are the same, which should return `True`.
   - `assert func_1('data') == False`: This also tests a string with different characters, which should return `False`.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to check if all characters are the same for any valid input as outlined in the problem description, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
