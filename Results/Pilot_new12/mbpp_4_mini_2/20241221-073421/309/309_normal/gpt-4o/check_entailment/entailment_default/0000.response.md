Explanation: The code appears to be correct based on the problem description and the provided examples. The function `func_1` checks whether all characters in a string are the same. It correctly handles the case of an empty string by returning `True`. For non-empty strings, it compares each character to the first character and returns `False` if any character differs. The output hints also support this assessment by confirming that the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases. Since there are no indications of missing logic or edge cases that invalidate the function, it is deemed correct.

Correctness: **True**.
