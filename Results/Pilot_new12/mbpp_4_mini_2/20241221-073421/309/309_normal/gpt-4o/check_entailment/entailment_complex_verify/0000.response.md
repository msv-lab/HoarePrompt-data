Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle the empty string case as specified in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` returns `True` for an empty string input, which suggests that "all characters are the same" due to the absence of characters. However, this contradicts the logical interpretation that an empty string has no characters at all, making the assertion invalid. According to the problem description, the expectation would typically be that an empty string should return `False`, since there are no characters to compare. Hence, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **False** is accurate.
