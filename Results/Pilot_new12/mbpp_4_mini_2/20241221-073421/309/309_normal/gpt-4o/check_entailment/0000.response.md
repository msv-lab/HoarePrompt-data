Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case of an empty string correctly. According to the problem description, the function should check if all characters in the string are the same. However, the program returns `True` for an empty input (`func_1('')`), which contradicts the expectation that it should return `False`. An empty string has no characters, so it can't be said that all characters are the same. Hence, this is a potential case where the program does not work as expected.
