To check if the program meets the requirements of the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and the provided assertions.

### Problem description:
The task is to write a Python function that checks whether all the characters in a string are the same.

### Program:
```python
assert func_1('python') == False
assert func_1('aaa') == True
assert func_1('data') == False

def func_1(s):
    if not s:
        return True
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis of the function:
1. **Empty string check**: The function returns `True` when `s` is empty (`if not s:`). This behavior is not specified in the problem statement, which may lead to incorrect assumptions about what the return value should be in this case. Depending on interpretation, an empty string may or may not be considered as "all characters being the same."
  
2. **Logic for non-empty strings**: 
   - If the input string is `python`, it returns `False` which is expected because all characters are not the same.
   - If the input string is `aaa`, it returns `True`, which is correct.
   - If the input string is `data`, it returns `False`, which is also correct.

### Potential case:
We need to consider the case of an empty string. Since it returns `True` for an empty string, we must question whether that aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem statement. If the statement about all characters being the same did not include the case of an empty string, the output could be deemed unexpected.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the function does not clearly handle the edge case of an empty string according to common interpretations (usually, it would return `False` unless explicitly stated). 

Thus, the correctness of the program based on the problem description can be deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
