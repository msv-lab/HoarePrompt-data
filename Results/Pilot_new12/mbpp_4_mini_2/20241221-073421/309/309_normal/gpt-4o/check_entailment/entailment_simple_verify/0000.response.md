Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The problem description requires the function to check if all characters in the string are the same. The function currently returns `True` for an empty string, which contradicts the expectation, as there are no characters to compare. An empty string therefore cannot satisfy the requirement of having all same characters since it lacks characters altogether. Hence, the program does not handle this case correctly, making it not meet the problem description's requirements.
