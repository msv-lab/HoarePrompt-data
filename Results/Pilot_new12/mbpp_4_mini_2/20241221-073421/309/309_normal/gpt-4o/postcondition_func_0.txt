The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string. If `s` is an empty string, the function returns `True`. If `s` is not empty, it checks whether all characters in the string are the same as the first character of `s`. If they are, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle inputs that are not strings, which may lead to errors if such inputs are provided. Thus, it effectively checks for uniformity of characters in the string while addressing the edge case of an empty string.
