#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string with a length of at least 0.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string with a length of at least 0, and `s` is not an empty string.
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string composed entirely of `first_char`, `first_char` is still the first character of `s`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the string 's' is composed entirely of the character 'first_char', which is also the first character of 's'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `s`, which is expected to be a string. If `s` is an empty string, the function returns `True`. If `s` is not empty, it checks whether all characters in the string are the same as the first character of `s`. If they are, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function does not handle inputs that are not strings, which may lead to errors if such inputs are provided. Thus, it effectively checks for uniformity of characters in the string while addressing the edge case of an empty string.
