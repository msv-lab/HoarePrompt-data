Final: **False**

The original assessment claims that the function `func_1(s)` is correct, asserting that it handles all edge cases, including an empty string. However, the output hints explicitly state that the function does not handle cases where `s` is an empty string or `None`, which may lead to unexpected behavior. Specifically, when passed an empty string, the function returns `True` (due to the set being empty), which contradicts the intention of checking if all characters are the same.

Since the function does not account for or properly handle these scenarios, it fails to meet the complete requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the assessment should be updated to reflect this issue with handling edge cases.
