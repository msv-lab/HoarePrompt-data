Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description due to its handling of certain edge cases. Specifically, the function does not explicitly address the behavior when the input string `s` is empty. According to the problem description, the function is expected to check whether all characters in the string are the same. While the function will work correctly for non-empty strings with identical characters, it will return `True` for an empty string (since `set('')` results in an empty set with length 0, and `0 == 1` is `False`). 

This behavior is inconsistent with the implicit expectation from the problem description, which does not clarify how empty strings should be treated. Therefore, since the function does not define behavior for all potential cases, including the empty string, it cannot be regarded as correct. 

To summarize, the function fails to correctly handle the case when `s` is empty and does not fulfill the problem description for all potential inputs.
