Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly states that the function `func_1(s)` accurately checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same. The annotated version confirms that the function uses the conversion of the string into a set to eliminate duplicate characters and checks the length of that set. If the length is 1, it indicates that all characters are identical, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. 

The function handles various cases appropriately, including empty strings, single-character strings, strings with identical characters, and strings with different characters. Hence, the assessment of correctness as **True** remains valid and supported by both the problem description and the annotations provided.
