Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether all characters in the given string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string to a set, which removes duplicates. If the length of this set is 1, it indicates that all characters in the string are the same.

The function works correctly for the following cases:
1. An empty string: `func_1("")` would return `True` since there are no different characters.
2. A string with the same character repeated: `func_1("aaaa")` would return `True`.
3. A string with different characters: `func_1("abc")` would return `False`.

Since the function handles these scenarios correctly and there are no edge cases that it does not account for, the implementation is correct.
