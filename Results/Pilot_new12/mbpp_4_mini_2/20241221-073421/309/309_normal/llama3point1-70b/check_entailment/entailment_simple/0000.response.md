Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It uses the `set` data structure to eliminate any duplicate characters in the string `s`. The length of this set is then checked. If all characters in `s` are the same, the set will contain exactly one unique character, resulting in a length of 1. Therefore, `len(set(s)) == 1` will evaluate to `True`. Conversely, if there are different characters in the string, the set will contain more than one unique character, and the condition will evaluate to `False`. 

This correctly fulfills the requirement to check whether all characters in the string are the same or not. The function handles valid inputs as specified in the problem description, returning the expected boolean result in all cases. Thus, it reliably meets the problem's criteria.
