Correctness: **False**

The provided function checks whether all characters in a string are the same by converting the string `s` to a set and checking if the length of that set is 1. However, it does not explicitly handle cases where `s` is an empty string or `None`. 

For instance:
1. Input: `s = ""` (empty string) would result in `len(set("")) == 0`, which returns `False`. However, it could be argued that since there are no characters to compare, the function should return `True` as there are no differing characters.
2. Input: `s = None` will raise an error when attempting to convert `None` to a set since `None` is not iterable.

Since the program fails for these edge cases, it does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
