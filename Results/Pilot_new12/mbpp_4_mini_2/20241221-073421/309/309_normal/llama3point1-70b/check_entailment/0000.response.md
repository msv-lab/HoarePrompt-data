Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same or not. It does so by converting the string into a set, which removes duplicate characters, and then checking if the length of that set is 1. If the length is 1, it means all characters in the string are the same; otherwise, they are not. 

This approach works for different cases, including:
1. An empty string `""`, which returns `True` since there are no differing characters.
2. A single-character string like `"a"` or `"1"`, which returns `True`.
3. A multi-character string with identical characters such as `"aaaa"` or `"1111"`, which returns `True`.
4. A string with different characters such as `"abc"` or `"aabb"`, which returns `False`.

Thus, it properly satisfies the requirements of the problem description for all edge cases.
