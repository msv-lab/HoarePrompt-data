Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly fulfills the problem description by checking if all items in the provided list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. The logic of the function has been verified against various test cases and the analysis of its behavior.

1. The function immediately returns `False` upon finding any item that does not equal the `element`, which is consistent with the problem's requirement.
2. If the list is empty, the function will correctly return `True`, as there are no unequal items, which aligns with the output hints that indicate this behavior.
3. The examples provided in the assertions validate that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios.

The output hints complement the original assessment by clarifying the behavior of the function without introducing any new contradictions. Given this consistent reasoning, the function operates correctly per the specifications outlined in the problem description.
