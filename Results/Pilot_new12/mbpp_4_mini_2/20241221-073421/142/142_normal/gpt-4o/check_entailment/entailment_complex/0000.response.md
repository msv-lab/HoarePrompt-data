Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's how it complies:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes in two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `element`, which is the item to be compared against each element in the list.

2. **Iteration and Comparison**: The function iterates over each item in the list. It checks whether any item is not equal to `element`. If it finds any such item, the function returns `False`. This behavior fulfills the requirement to check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

3. **Return True for All Equal Elements**: If all items in `lst` are equal to `element`, the function reaches the return statement after the loop and returns `True`. This is consistent with stating that all items in the list are equal to the specified element.

4. **Handling of Empty Lists**: When `lst` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the function reaches the return statement to return `True`. This behavior can also be considered correct, as there are no items to compare, indicating that all (zero) items match the element.

5. **Correctness Against Test Cases**: The assertions provided show that the function behaves as expected in different scenarios (e.g., lists with different elements, lists with the same elements, and using an empty list). 

Overall, the program adheres strictly to the problem description's requirements, correctly identifying whether all elements in the list are equal to the specified element. Thus, it is deemed correct.
