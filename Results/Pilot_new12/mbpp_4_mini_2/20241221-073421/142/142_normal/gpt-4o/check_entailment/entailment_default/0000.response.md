The given program is intended to check whether all items in a list are equal to a specified element. The implementation iterates through each item in the list and immediately returns `False` if it finds any item that does not equal the given element. If it checks all items without finding any discrepancies, it returns `True`.

The output hints explain that if the list is empty, the function will return `True`, since there are no items to compare. This behavior is consistent with the description of the function and is logical in terms of handling an empty list.

However, while evaluating the program's correctness, we need to ensure that it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, including the edge case where the input list is empty.

1. The program correctly returns `False` when items do not match.
2. The program correctly returns `True` when all items match.
3. The program returns `True` for an empty list, which is a reasonable and expected behavior in this scenario.

Based on the analysis, the program handles all specified use cases correctly, including the edge case of an empty list. Therefore, the functionality aligns with the requirement of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
