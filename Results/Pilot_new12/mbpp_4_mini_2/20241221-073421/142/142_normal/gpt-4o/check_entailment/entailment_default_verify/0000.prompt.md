You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to check whether all items in the given list are equal to the specified element. It iterates through each item in the list and compares it to the given element. If any item is not equal to the element, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any discrepancies, it returns `True`.

This implementation effectively handles all edge cases:
1. An empty list (the function will return `True` because there are no elements that can contradict the condition).
2. A list with all items equal to the element (it will return `True`).
3. A list with at least one item different from the element (it will return `False`).

The assertions provided in the code further confirm the correctness of the implementation for multiple test cases. Since it handles every case as described, the correctness of the program is affirmed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an item `element`. It checks if all the items in `lst` are equal to `element`. The function returns `False` as soon as it finds any item in `lst` that is not equal to `element`. If `lst` is empty, the function reaches the return statement and returns `True`, since there are no items to compare. This behavior contradicts the annotated postcondition that claims it always returns `True` regardless of the content of `lst`. If all items in `lst` are equal to `element`, the function will return `True` after checking all items. Overall, the function effectively determines if all elements in the list are the same as the given `element`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
