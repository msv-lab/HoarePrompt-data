Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every potential case. According to the description, the function should check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. 

A specific case that reveals the program's incorrectness is when the input list is empty. According to the provided hints, if the list `lst` is empty, the function returns `True`, as there are no items to compare. However, logically, the statement "all items in the list are equal to the given element" should also hold true when there are no items to contradict it. Therefore, while the current implementation does return `True` for an empty list, this doesn't align with the expectation of confirming equality to the element since there are no items present to affirm this condition.

Furthermore, the code correctly identifies cases where not all elements match the given element (as asserted in the given test cases), but the handling of an empty list makes the program incorrect in scope, as it doesn't satisfy the problem's requirement in all possible scenarios.
