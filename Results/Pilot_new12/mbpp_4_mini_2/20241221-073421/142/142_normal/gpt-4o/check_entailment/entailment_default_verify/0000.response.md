Based on the analysis of the problem description, the program, and the original assessment, I conclude as follows:

The problem description requires the function to check if all items in a list are equal to a specified element. The assertions provided clearly show the expected behavior of the function, and the implementation indeed verifies this requirement. The function iterates through the list, returning `False` if any item differs from the specified element and returning `True` if all items are equal or if the list is empty.

The original assessment marked the program's correctness as **True**, accurately reflecting that the implementation adheres to the problem description's requirements and effectively handles the defined edge cases.

However, the output hints indicate a contradiction in how the postcondition is described: they assert that the function always returns `True` regardless of the content of `lst`, which does not align with the provided implementation. The function does return `True` for an empty list, but it also returns `False` when it encounters any element that does not match the specified `element`. This behavior is correctly coded; thus, it aligns with the problem description requirements.

Therefore, despite the confusion raised by the output hints, the program's logic is accurate and consistent with the problem description, as the function is designed to return `False` when it finds a mismatch.

Final: **True**
