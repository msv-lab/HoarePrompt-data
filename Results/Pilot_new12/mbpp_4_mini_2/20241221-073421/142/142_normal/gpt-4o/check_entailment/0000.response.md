Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to check whether all items in the given list are equal to the specified element. It iterates through each item in the list and compares it to the given element. If any item is not equal to the element, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any discrepancies, it returns `True`.

This implementation effectively handles all edge cases:
1. An empty list (the function will return `True` because there are no elements that can contradict the condition).
2. A list with all items equal to the element (it will return `True`).
3. A list with at least one item different from the element (it will return `False`).

The assertions provided in the code further confirm the correctness of the implementation for multiple test cases. Since it handles every case as described, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
