The original assessment claims that the function `func_1` operates correctly based on the problem description. After analyzing both the original assessment and the provided annotated version, I have concluded that there are inconsistencies in the assessment.

While the initial explanation of the function's purpose is accurate, the annotations question the correctness of the return statements. Specifically, the annotation indicates that after the for loop, if `lst` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns `True`. This means that the function will incorrectly indicate that an empty list (i.e., a case where not all items can be equal to the element since there are no items to compare) satisfies the condition of all items being equal to the given element. Therefore, the assessment fails to account for this edge case.

In summary, since the function `func_1` will return `True` for an empty list, which does not align with the problem description stating that it should check whether all items are equal to the given element, I adjust the correctness evaluation accordingly.

Final: **False**
