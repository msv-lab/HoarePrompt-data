Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the provided list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. 

1. It iterates through each item in the list. 
2. If it finds an item that is not equal to `element`, it immediately returns `False`.
3. If the loop completes without finding any unequal items, it returns `True`.

The provided assertions also demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the tested cases:

- The first assertion checks if the list `['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white']` contains only the element `'blue'`, which it does not, so the function correctly returns `False`.
- The second assertion checks if the list `[1, 2, 3, 4]` contains only the element `7`, which it does not; the function again correctly returns `False`.
- The third assertion checks if all items in the list `['green', 'green', 'green', 'green']` are equal to `'green'`, which they are; hence, the function correctly returns `True`.

There are no edge cases that have been overlooked, and the logic is sound for all potential inputs including an empty list (which would also return `True` as there are no unequal elements). Thus, considering all of the above, the function is correct.
