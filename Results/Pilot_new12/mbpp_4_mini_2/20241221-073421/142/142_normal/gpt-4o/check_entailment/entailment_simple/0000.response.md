Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is intended to check whether all items in the provided list are equal to the given element. However, the logic is flawed in the following way:

1. The function correctly returns `False` as soon as it encounters an item in the list that is not equal to `element`, which aligns with part of the requirement.
2. However, it does not account for the case where the input list is empty. In the case of an empty list, the for loop does not execute and the function directly returns `True`. This means that for an empty list and any element, `func_1([], 'some_element')` will incorrectly return `True`, suggesting that all (zero) items in the list are equal to the given element.

According to the typical definition of the problem (i.e., all items in the list should be equal to the given element), when the list is empty, the function should ideally return `False`, as there are no elements to satisfy the equality condition. 

Therefore, the program fails to handle the empty list case correctly and does not always do what the problem description asks for in every potential case.
