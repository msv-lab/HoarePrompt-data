#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of items, and element is the item to be compared with the items in the list.
def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of items, `element` is equal to every item in `lst`. If `lst` is an empty list, the loop does not execute; hence no checks are made, and the return statement is never reached. In that case, no variable states change related to the for loop.
    return True
    #The program returns True regardless of the content of the list `lst`, as there are no conditions affecting this return statement.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an item `element`. It checks if all the items in `lst` are equal to `element`. The function returns `False` as soon as it finds any item in `lst` that is not equal to `element`. If `lst` is empty, the function reaches the return statement and returns `True`, since there are no items to compare. This behavior contradicts the annotated postcondition that claims it always returns `True` regardless of the content of `lst`. If all items in `lst` are equal to `element`, the function will return `True` after checking all items. Overall, the function effectively determines if all elements in the list are the same as the given `element`.
