According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If `lst` has at least 1 item, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, `element` is provided for comparison but does not influence the loop's execution. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 item, and `item` would be the first item in the list during the first iteration.

State: **`lst` is a list of items that must have at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the list**
