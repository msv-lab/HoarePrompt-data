According to the code, whether the loop can execute one more time depends on the `lst`. If the list has at least 3 items, the loop can execute again for the third item. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the list and is equal to `element`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 items, and `item` must correspond to the third item in the list. 

State: **`lst` is a list of items with at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the list and is equal to `element`**
