The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list of items, and `element`, which is the item to be compared with the items in the list. The function may return different values based on specific conditions:

- Case 1: The function returns `False` since the current value of an item in the list is not equal to `element`.
- Case 2: The function returns `False`.
- Case 3: The function returns `False`.
- Case 4: The function returns `True` regardless of the content of the list `lst`, as there are no conditions affecting this return statement.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and an `element`, and based on the evaluations of the items in the list with respect to `element`, it might return `True` or `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and an item `element`, and it returns `False` if the conditions in the first three cases are met; otherwise, it returns `True` if none of these conditions apply.**
