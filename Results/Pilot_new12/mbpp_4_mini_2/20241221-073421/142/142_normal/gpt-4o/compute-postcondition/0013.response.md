Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an item `element`. It checks if all the items in `lst` are equal to `element`. The function returns `False` as soon as it finds any item in `lst` that is not equal to `element`. If `lst` is empty, the function reaches the return statement and returns `True`, since there are no items to compare. This behavior contradicts the annotated postcondition that claims it always returns `True` regardless of the content of `lst`. If all items in `lst` are equal to `element`, the function will return `True` after checking all items. Overall, the function effectively determines if all elements in the list are the same as the given `element`.**
