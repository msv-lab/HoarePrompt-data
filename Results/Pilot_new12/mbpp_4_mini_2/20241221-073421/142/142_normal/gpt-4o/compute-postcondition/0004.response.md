According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If the list has at least 2 items, the loop can execute again for the second item. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 1 item, and `item` is the first item in the list, which is equal to `element`. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 2 items, and `item` must equal the second item in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of items that must have at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the list, and `item` is equal to `element`**
