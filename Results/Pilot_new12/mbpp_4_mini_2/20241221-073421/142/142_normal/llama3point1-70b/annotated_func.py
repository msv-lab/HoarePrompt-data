#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is a value that can be of any type.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether all items in the list 'lst' are equal to the 'element'
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an `element` of any type. It checks if all items in the list are equal to the given `element`. The function returns `True` if every item is the same as `element`, and returns `False` if at least one item is different. Importantly, if the list is empty, the function will return `True` since vacuously all elements (none in this case) are equal to the element. This behavior aligns with the expected return postcondition which states that the function indicates whether all items in the list are equal to the provided element.
