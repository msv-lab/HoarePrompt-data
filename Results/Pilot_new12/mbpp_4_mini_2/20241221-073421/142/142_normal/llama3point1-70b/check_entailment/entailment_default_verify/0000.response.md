Final: **True**

The program indeed meets the problem description by defining a function that checks if all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. The original assessment of correctness is accurate as it correctly identifies the handling of various edge cases, including an empty list, lists where all elements match the given element, and lists with at least one differing element. The behavior described in the output hints aligns perfectly with the program's implementation, reaffirming the correctness of the function. Overall, the program behaves as intended based on the criteria provided in the problem description.
