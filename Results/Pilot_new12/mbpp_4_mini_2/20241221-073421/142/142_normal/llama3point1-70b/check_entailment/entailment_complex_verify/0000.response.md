Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program successfully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to check if all elements in a given list are equal to a specified element. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected in all potential scenarios:

1. The function appropriately handles an empty list by returning `True`, which is consistent with the principle that all (zero) elements in an empty set can be considered equal to any reference element.
2. It returns `True` when all elements in the list match the given element.
3. It returns `False` if at least one element in the list does not match the specified element.

The annotations clarify the logic and details of how the program achieves its functionality without error, aligning perfectly with the assessment of correctness. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program correctly fulfills the problem description as stated.
