Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and an `element`, and it uses the `all()` function to check whether every item in the list is equal to the specified `element`. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Checks Equality**: The use of `item == element` within a generator expression effectively checks if every item in the list matches the given element.

2. **Handles All Cases**: 
   - If all items in the list are equal to the provided element, it returns `True`.
   - If at least one item differs from the element, it returns `False`.
   - Crucially, if the list is empty, the function returns `True`, which is the expected behavior since vacuously, there are no elements that are unequal to the element.

3. **Vacuous Truth**: The explanation confirms that the function's behavior aligns with the mathematical definition of vacuous truth, satisfying the requirement in the problem description.

Overall, the function correctly fulfills the task of determining if all items in a list are equal to a given element, adhering strictly to the provided problem description.
