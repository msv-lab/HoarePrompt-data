Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether all items in the provided list are equal to the specified element using the built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression. All potential cases are handled, including:

1. An empty list, where the condition is vacuously true since there are no items to compare.
2. A list with elements equal to the given element, which should return `True`.
3. A list with at least one element not equal to the given element, which should return `False`.

Every situation specified in the problem description is addressed appropriately by the program logic.
