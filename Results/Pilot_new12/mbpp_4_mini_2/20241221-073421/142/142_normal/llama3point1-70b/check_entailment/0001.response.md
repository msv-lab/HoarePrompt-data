Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the task of checking if all items in a list are equal to a given element. 

### Explanation:
1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst` (a list) and `element` (an element to compare against).
2. It uses the built-in `all()` function, which returns `True` if all elements in the iterable (in this case, a generator expression) are `True`.
3. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` checks each item in the list to see if it is equal to the specified element.
4. If the list is empty, the `all()` function will return `True` as there are no elements that would contradict the condition (the condition is vacuously true).
5. There are no edge cases encountered in typical usage scenarios (e.g., different types or variable length of the list).

Thus, since the condition is correctly implemented and handles the edge cases (like an empty list), the program is confirmed to be correct.
