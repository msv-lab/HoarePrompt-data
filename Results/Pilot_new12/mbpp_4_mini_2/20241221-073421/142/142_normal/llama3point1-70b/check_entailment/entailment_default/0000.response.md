Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic of checking whether all items in the list are equal to the provided element. The use of `all()` combined with a generator expression ensures that it efficiently evaluates each item in the list. Importantly, the output hints clarify that if the input list is empty, the function returns `True`, which aligns with the mathematical principle that all elements in an empty set vacuously satisfy the condition of being equal to any given element. Therefore, the function behaves as expected for all potential cases. 

Correctness: **True**.
