Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `lst` and an element `element`, and it checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element using the built-in `all()` function combined with a generator expression.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function assumes valid inputs, where `lst` is a list and `element` can be of any type.
2. **Logic Implementation**: The core of the function utilizes `all(item == element for item in lst)`, which iterates over each item in `lst` and checks if it is equal to `element`. The `all()` function returns `True` if every comparison is `True` (i.e., if all items in the list are equal to the specified element); otherwise, it returns `False`.
3. **Edge Cases**: In cases where the list is empty, the `all()` function will return `True` (since there are no items to contradict the condition), which aligns with the behavior of checking for equality for all items in the list.

Thus, the program fulfills the requirement of checking if all items in the list equal the specified element, leading to the conclusion that it meets the problem description's criteria.
