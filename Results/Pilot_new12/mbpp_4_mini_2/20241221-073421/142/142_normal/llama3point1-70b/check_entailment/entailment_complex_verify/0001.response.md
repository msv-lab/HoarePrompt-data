Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the program is correct is accurate. Based on the problem description, the function `func_1` effectively checks whether all items in a given list `lst` are equal to the provided `element`. The use of the `all()` function in conjunction with a generator expression accurately generates the required boolean output. 

The annotations correctly describe the various states of the program, specifically highlighting that it handles an empty list properly (returning `True` in this case). The clarity and correctness in both the original assessment and annotations confirm that the program fulfills the requirements set forth by the problem description without encountering edge case issues.

Thus, the program's logic and behavior align with what is expected, validating the correctness of the initial assessment.
