You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all((item == element for item in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the task of checking if all items in a list are equal to a given element. 

### Explanation:
1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst` (a list) and `element` (an element to compare against).
2. It uses the built-in `all()` function, which returns `True` if all elements in the iterable (in this case, a generator expression) are `True`.
3. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` checks each item in the list to see if it is equal to the specified element.
4. If the list is empty, the `all()` function will return `True` as there are no elements that would contradict the condition (the condition is vacuously true).
5. There are no edge cases encountered in typical usage scenarios (e.g., different types or variable length of the list).

Thus, since the condition is correctly implemented and handles the edge cases (like an empty list), the program is confirmed to be correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and element is a value that can be of any type.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether all items in the list 'lst' are equal to the 'element'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
