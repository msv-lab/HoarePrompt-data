Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. It checks if all elements in the input list `lst` are equal to the specified `element`. The use of the `all()` function along with a generator expression ensures that the function efficiently checks this condition for all items in the list.

The behavior of the function when the list is empty is also aligned with the problem description. According to the logic of the function, if the list is empty, `all()` returns `True`, which is the correct behavior because there are no elements that could be unequal to the given `element`.

In conclusion, the code handles all potential cases correctly based on the problem description, including the case of empty lists.
