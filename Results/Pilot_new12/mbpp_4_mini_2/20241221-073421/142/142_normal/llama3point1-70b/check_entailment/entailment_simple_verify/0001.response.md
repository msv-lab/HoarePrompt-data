Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. Analyzing the provided program and the annotated version, we can see the following:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` correctly takes two parameters: a list (`lst`) and an element (`element`) that can be of any type.
2. **Behavior of the Function**: The use of the `all()` function checks whether all items in the list are equal to the specified element. This is done effectively through a generator expression.
3. **Edge Cases**: The behavior of `all()` when called with an empty list is well understood; it returns `True` in this case, which aligns with the function's intended behavior described in the problem statement.
4. **Annotated State**: The annotations confirm that the state of the program is as expected right before the function call and during its execution, as they detail the expected types of `lst` and `element`, as well as the return type.

Since the program meets all requirements stated in the problem description and there's an alignment with the annotations affirming its correctness, the final assessment remains valid.

Overall, there are no inconsistencies or issues found, thus confirming the original assessment.
