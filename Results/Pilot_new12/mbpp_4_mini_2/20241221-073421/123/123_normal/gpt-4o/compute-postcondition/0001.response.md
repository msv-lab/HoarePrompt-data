The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. The parameter `lst` is a list of elements, and `L` is a non-negative integer that satisfies the condition 0 <= L <= len(lst). After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the first `L` elements of the list `lst` and the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple consisting of the first `L` elements of `lst` and the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.**
