The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`. It returns a tuple consisting of two elements: the first element is a sublist containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second element is a sublist containing the elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`. It effectively divides the input list into two parts based on the given index `L`. If `L` is 0, the first part will be an empty list and the second part will be the entire list. If `L` equals the length of `lst`, the first part will contain all elements and the second part will be empty.
