Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the provided function `func_1` adheres to the specifications given in the problem description. The function appropriately splits the list into two parts based on the non-negative integer `L`, returning a tuple consisting of the first `L` elements and the remainder of the list. The annotations confirm that the states before and during the function's execution align with the expected behavior defined in the original assessment. 

Additionally, the function handles edge cases successfully as outlined in the assessment, such as when `L` is greater than the list length, when `L` is `0`, and when the list is empty. Thus, upon review of the details in both the assessment and the annotations, the conclusion of correctness remains validated.
