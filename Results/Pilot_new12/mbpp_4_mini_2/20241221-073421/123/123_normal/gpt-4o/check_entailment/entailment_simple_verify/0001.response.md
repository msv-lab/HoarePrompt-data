Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle cases where the integer L exceeds the length of the list. According to the problem description, the function should split the list into two parts, where the length of the first part is L. However, when L is greater than the length of the list, as pointed out in the original assessment with the example `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, the function returns `([1, 2, 3], [])`. This result does not fulfill the requirement because the first part should not exceed the total length of the list. The program does not enforce any constraints on the value of L relative to the length of lst, which could lead to unintended behavior. Thus, the program's correctness is not upheld according to the problem description.
