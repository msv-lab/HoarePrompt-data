To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, I'll analyze the function `func_1` against the requirements of splitting a list into two parts based on an integer L.

Here's the given program:

```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

The problem description states:

> Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

### Analysis of the Function

1. **Expected Behavior:**
   - The function is supposed to return a tuple where the first element is a sub-list of length L, and the second element is the remainder of the list after those L elements.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If L is greater than the length of the list, it should return the entire list as the first part and an empty list as the second part.
   - If L is 0, it should return two empty lists since there would be no elements in the first part.
   - If the list is empty, irrespective of L, it should return a pair of empty lists.

### Testing Edge Cases:

- **Case 1:** When L is greater than the list length:
  ```python
  assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 5) == ([1, 2, 3], [])
  ```
  - This works as expected.

- **Case 2:** When L is 0:
  ```python
  assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 0) == ([], [1, 2, 3])
  ```
  - This works as expected.

- **Case 3:** When the list is empty:
  ```python
  assert func_1([], 0) == ([], [])
  ```
  - This works as expected.

- **Case 4:** When L is negative:
  ```python
  assert func_1([1, 2, 3], -1) == ([], [1, 2, 3])
  ```
  - This works as expected by returning the entire list as the second part.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly according to the problem description:

### Conclusion
No potential cases where the function would not behave as expected were found.

Correctness: **True**.
