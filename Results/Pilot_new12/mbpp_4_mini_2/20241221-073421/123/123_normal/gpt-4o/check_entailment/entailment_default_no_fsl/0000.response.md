Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and splits the list into two parts:

1. The first part contains the first `L` elements of `lst` (i.e., `lst[:L]`).
2. The second part contains the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list (i.e., `lst[L:]`).

The program also adheres to the constraints provided in the output hints:
- If `L` is 0, the first part will indeed be an empty list, and the second part will contain all elements of the list.
- If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first part will contain all elements while the second part will be empty.

As verified with the provided assertions and the behavior described in the output hints, there are no missing cases or logic flaws.

Therefore, the program meets all specified requirements for every potential case.
