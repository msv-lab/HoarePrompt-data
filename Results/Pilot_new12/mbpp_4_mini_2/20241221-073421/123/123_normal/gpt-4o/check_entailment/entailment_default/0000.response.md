Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts based on the given integer `L`. The code checks the input list and the integer `L`, and based on the slice operations, it handles cases where `L` is 0 or equal to the length of the list appropriately. 

- If `L` is 0, then the first part will be an empty list and the second part will be the entire list.
- If `L` equals the length of the list, then the first part will contain all elements and the second part will be empty.

All the provided assertions match the expected output as per the problem statement, and thus the function works correctly for every potential case described, demonstrating adherence to the problem requirements.
