Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why the implementation is considered correct:
1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two arguments: `lst`, which is a list, and `L`, which is an integer.
2. **Splitting the List**: The function splits the list into two parts:
   - The first part contains the first `L` elements from the list, obtained using slicing (`lst[:L]`).
   - The second part contains the remainder of the list starting from index `L` to the end, also obtained using slicing (`lst[L:]`).
3. **Returning a Tuple**: The function returns both parts as a tuple, which matches the requirement of the problem description.

The assertions provided in the annotated program confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs regarding varying data types in the list and different values of `L`. The function correctly handles all specified cases, adhering to the constraints that the input `L` is always such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)` as defined in the state of the program right before the function call. Thus, it does not encounter any out-of-bounds errors and meets the problem's requirements perfectly.
