Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the integer L is greater than the length of the list. For example, if we execute `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, the function will return `([1, 2, 3], [])`, which is not correct according to the problem description since the first part should not exceed the length of the list. Hence, the program does not fulfill the requirement of splitting the list correctly for all possible cases.
