Correctness: **True**

The program fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst, L)` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`.

2. **Splitting Logic**: The function slices the list into two parts:
   - The first part (`lst[:L]`) consists of the first `L` elements of `lst`.
   - The second part (`lst[L:]`) contains all the elements from index `L` to the end of the list.

3. **Tuple Return**: The function returns a tuple containing these two parts, which directly aligns with the problem's requirement of returning the two lists as a tuple.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases as specified:
   - If `L` is 0, it correctly returns an empty list for the first part and the whole list for the second part.
   - If `L` equals the length of `lst`, it returns the entire list in the first part and an empty list in the second part.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions in the code serve as a form of tests that confirm the function behaves as expected based on given examples. Each assertion checks the expected behavior of the function in various scenarios.

Overall, the function adheres to the problem description in all potential cases, thus confirming its correctness.
