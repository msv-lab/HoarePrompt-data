You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the task of splitting a list into two parts based on an integer `L`. It uses Python's slicing features, which handle various cases correctly:

1. If `L` is less than or equal to the length of the list, it will return the first `L` elements as the first part and the remainder as the second part.
2. If `L` is equal to the length of the list, it will return the entire list in the first part and an empty list as the second part.
3. If `L` is greater than the length of the list, the first part will contain the entire list, and the second part will be empty.

Thus, the function accounts for edge cases such as empty lists and `L` values that exceed the list length, ensuring it operates as specified in the problem description for all possible input scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of any type and a non-negative integer `L`, where \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)}\). It returns a tuple containing two elements: the first element is a list containing the first `L` elements from `lst`, and the second element is a list containing the remaining elements from `lst`, starting from index `L` to the end. Importantly, if `L` is 0, the first element of the tuple will be an empty list and all elements of `lst` will be in the second element. If `L` equals the length of `lst`, the first element of the tuple will contain all elements of `lst` and the second element will be empty. There are no additional checks or error handling for invalid inputs, relying on the precondition provided for `L`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
