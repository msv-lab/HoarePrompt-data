Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Inputs**:
   - The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L` such that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)}\). This condition is explicitly noted in both the comments and the annotations, thereby ensuring valid input as per the description.

2. **Output Specification**:
   - The function splits the list `lst` into two parts:
     - The first part contains the first `L` elements of the list, obtained using slicing (`lst[:L]`).
     - The second part contains the elements from index `L` to the end of the list, also via slicing (`lst[L:]`).
   - This results in a tuple with the first element as the first part of the list and the second element as the remaining part, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `L` is `0`, the function correctly returns an empty list for the first element of the tuple and the entire list `lst` for the second element.
   - If `L` equals the length of `lst`, the function returns the entire list as the first element and an empty list for the second element.
  
4. **No Additional Checks**: 
   - The comments clarify that there are no additional error checks or handling, which aligns with the assumption that inputs will always be within the specified bounds. Therefore, these omissions do not detract from the correctness of the function.

In summary, the function behaves as required by the problem description across all potential valid cases, demonstrating that it meets the specifications provided.
