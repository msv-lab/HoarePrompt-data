To analyze the program based on the provided problem description, we need to ensure that it handles all possible cases appropriately.

**Problem Description**: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(lst, L):
    return (lst[:L], lst[L:])
```

### Considerations:
1. If `L` is negative, the slice `lst[:L]` will return an empty list, and `lst[L:]` will return the entire list, which could be a valid behavior since it still meets the criteria of splitting the list. However, this aspect could be debatable.
  
2. If `L` is greater than the length of the list, `lst[:L]` will return the entire list, and `lst[L:]` will be empty. This behavior is also internally consistent according to Python's list slicing.

3. If `L` is zero, the function would return an empty list for the first part and the entire list for the second part, which is again valid.

4. If the input list is empty, regardless of `L`, the output will always be two empty lists, which still conforms to the request.

### Conclusion:
Given that the provided program handles all potential edge cases appropriately and adheres to the requirements of the problem description, I find no examples where the program fails to meet the criteria outlined.

Correctness: **True**.
