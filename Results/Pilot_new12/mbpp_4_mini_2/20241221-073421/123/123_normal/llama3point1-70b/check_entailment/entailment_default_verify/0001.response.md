Final: **True**

The program correctly meets the specifications provided in the problem description. The function `func_1` accurately splits the list `lst` into two parts based on the integer `L`, which adheres to the expected behavior outlined in the output hints.

1. The function handles cases where `L` is less than, equal to, or greater than the length of the list effectively due to Python's slicing.
2. If `L` is 0, the first element of the returned tuple is an empty list, and the second contains all elements of `lst`, which aligns with the output hints.
3. If `L` equals the length of the list, the first part contains the entire list, while the second part is empty, again matching the expected output.
4. The output hints clarify that the function does not implement additional input checks but assumes valid inputs, which aligns with the original assessment.

Thus, the analysis confirms that the original assessment of **True** is accurate, as the program correctly performs the required functionality and fulfills the outlined conditions.
