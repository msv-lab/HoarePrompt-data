Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly splits the list `lst` into two parts based on the integer `L`. 

1. If `L` is 0, the first part will indeed be an empty list, while the second part will contain all elements of `lst`.
2. If `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the first part will contain all elements of `lst`, and the second part will be an empty list.

The output hints confirm the functionality of the code, indicating that it has no issues handling the specified conditions of valid input. Thus, the code works correctly for every potential case described.
