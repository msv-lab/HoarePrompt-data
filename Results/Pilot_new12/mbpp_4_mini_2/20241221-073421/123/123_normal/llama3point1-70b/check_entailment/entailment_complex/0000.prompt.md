You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer L and splits the given list into two parts where the length of the first part of the list is L, and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of any type, L is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, L):
    return lst[:L], lst[L:]
    #The program returns a tuple containing the first L elements of the list 'lst' (lst[:L]) and the remaining elements from index L to the end of the list (lst[L:])
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of any type and a non-negative integer `L`, where \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)}\). It returns a tuple containing two elements: the first element is a list containing the first `L` elements from `lst`, and the second element is a list containing the remaining elements from `lst`, starting from index `L` to the end. Importantly, if `L` is 0, the first element of the tuple will be an empty list and all elements of `lst` will be in the second element. If `L` equals the length of `lst`, the first element of the tuple will contain all elements of `lst` and the second element will be empty. There are no additional checks or error handling for invalid inputs, relying on the precondition provided for `L`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
