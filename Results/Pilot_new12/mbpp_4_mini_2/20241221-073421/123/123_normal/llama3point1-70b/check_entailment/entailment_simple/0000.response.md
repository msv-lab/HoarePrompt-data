Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`. It returns a tuple containing two parts: 

1. The first part, which is the slice of the list from the beginning up to (but not including) index `L` (`lst[:L]`), effectively captures the first `L` elements of the list.
2. The second part, which is the remainder of the list starting from index `L` to the end of the list (`lst[L:]`), captures all elements from that point onward.

The program conditions specified that `L` will always be a non-negative integer satisfying the constraint `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, so the slicing will always be valid. 

Overall, the function behaves exactly as described, consistently splitting the input list into two segments of lengths determined by `L`, thus fulfilling the problem requirements in all cases.
