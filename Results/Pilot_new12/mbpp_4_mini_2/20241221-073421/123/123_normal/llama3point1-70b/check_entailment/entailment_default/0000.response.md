Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and it effectively splits the list into two parts: the first part consists of the first `L` elements, while the second part contains the remaining elements. The output hints further confirm that the function handles edge cases appropriately, such as when `L` is 0 (resulting in an empty first list) or when `L` equals the length of the list (resulting in an empty second list). Given that the program correctly addresses all cases stated in the problem description and there are no undiscovered edge cases that lead to incorrect behavior, we conclude that the function adheres to the specifications.

Correctness: **True**.
