Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the behavior of the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations. The function `func_1` correctly handles edge cases such as negative, zero, and excessively large values of `L`, as well as the case where `lst` is empty. The annotation clarifies that the function always returns a tuple containing two parts of the list, which aligns perfectly with the requirements specified in the problem description. Given that the program adheres to all stated conditions and handles potential variations appropriately, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.
