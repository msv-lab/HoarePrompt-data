Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the task of splitting a list into two parts based on an integer `L`. It uses Python's slicing features, which handle various cases correctly:

1. If `L` is less than or equal to the length of the list, it will return the first `L` elements as the first part and the remainder as the second part.
2. If `L` is equal to the length of the list, it will return the entire list in the first part and an empty list as the second part.
3. If `L` is greater than the length of the list, the first part will contain the entire list, and the second part will be empty.

Thus, the function accounts for edge cases such as empty lists and `L` values that exceed the list length, ensuring it operates as specified in the problem description for all possible input scenarios.
