Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to split a list into two parts based on a non-negative integer `L`. The annotations confirm that the input conditions are appropriately handled, adhering to the specified range for `L` in relation to the list's length. The behavior of the function is consistent with the problem description for all specified cases, including edge scenarios where `L` is zero or equal to the length of the list. Additionally, the assumption of valid inputs further supports the correctness of the program as described.
