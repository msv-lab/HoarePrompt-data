The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. The parameter `lst` is a list of any type, and the parameter `L` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len}(lst)\). After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing two elements: the first element is a list of the first `L` elements from `lst` (`lst[:L]`), and the second element is a list containing the remaining elements from index `L` to the end of the list (`lst[L:]`). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and return a tuple that includes the first `L` elements of the list and the remaining elements of the list after the first `L` elements.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple containing the first `L` elements of `lst` and the remaining elements from `lst` starting from index `L`.**
