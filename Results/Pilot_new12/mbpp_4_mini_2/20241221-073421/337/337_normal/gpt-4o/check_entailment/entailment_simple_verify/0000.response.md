Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The purpose of the program is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the implementation `return sum(set(lst))` sums all unique elements in the list, rather than excluding any element that appears more than once. 

For example, with the input `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, which sum to `20`. Instead, the current program adds `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, resulting in `21`. 

The provided annotations reaffirm this understanding of the program's behavior, indicating that the program returns the sum of unique integers, which does not align with the requirement to sum only non-repeated elements. Hence, the program does not meet the problem description.
