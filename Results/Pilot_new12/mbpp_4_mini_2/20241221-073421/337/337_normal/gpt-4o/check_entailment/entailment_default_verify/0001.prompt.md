You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21
assert func_1([1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]) == 71
assert func_1([12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]) == 78

def func_1(lst):
    return sum(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the given program in relation to the problem description, we analyze the function `func_1(lst)`.

The problem requires the function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. In contrast, the implementation uses `sum(set(lst))`, which simply sums all unique elements in the list, regardless of whether they are repeated or not.

For example:

- Consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The non-repeated (unique) elements are only 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The correct sum of these non-repeated elements would be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`.
- The program, however, would return the sum of all unique elements as follows: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`, which does not fulfill the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly implement the desired functionality based on the problem description.

Thus, the program exhibits incorrect behavior. 

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It computes and returns the sum of unique integers found in `lst`. If `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, as there are no integers to sum. This means that the output will also be 0 in cases where all integers in the list are duplicates, as they will be reduced to a unique sum of zero items. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `lst` contains non-integer values, which may lead to a TypeError during the execution.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
