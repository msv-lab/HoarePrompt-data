The annotated version provides clarity on the function's behavior. However, it reaffirms the original assessment's correctness. The problem is specifically asking for the sum of non-repeated elements from a list, meaning that any element that appears more than once should be omitted from the summation.

The function `func_1(lst)` currently computes the sum of all unique elements using `sum(set(lst))`, which will include all elements that appear at least once in the list, thereby failing to meet the requirement of summing only the non-repeated elements. 

For instance, using the provided example `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the correct result is `20` since `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6` are the non-repeated elements. However, the function produces `21` by incorrectly including `1` as a unique element.

Thus, the original assessment that states the program is incorrect still holds true based on the problem description and the behavior described in the annotated code. The function does not adhere to the necessity of excluding repeated elements.

Final: **False**
