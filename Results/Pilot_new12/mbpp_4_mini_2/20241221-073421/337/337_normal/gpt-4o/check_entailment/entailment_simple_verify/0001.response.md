Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description, which is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. The implementation of `func_1(lst)` incorrectly sums all unique elements rather than specifically non-repeated elements. The annotations clarify the state of the program before the function call and confirm that the function returns the sum of unique integers from the list, further supporting the conclusion that it does not meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the final assessment remains that the program is incorrect.
