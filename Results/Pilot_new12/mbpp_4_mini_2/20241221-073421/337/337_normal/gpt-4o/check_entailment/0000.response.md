Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the implementation uses `sum(set(lst))`, which will sum all unique elements of the list. This approach does not adhere to the requirement of summing only the non-repeated elements.

For instance, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`. Their sum is `20`. However, the current program will sum `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, leading to a total of `21`, which is incorrect.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in that it sums repeated elements rather than excluding them from the total.
