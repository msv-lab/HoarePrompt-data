The given program is intended to find the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in a list. The program uses the `set()` function to convert the list into a set, which inherently removes any duplicates, and then computes the sum of the unique elements.

However, the output hints indicate a potential issue with the program. Specifically, it states that the function does not handle cases where `lst` contains non-integer values, which may lead to a `TypeError` during execution. Although it's assumed that the input will always be valid, the problem description does not specify this restriction outright. Therefore, the program could fail if it encounters non-integer values, which is a potential case that the function does not handle correctly.

As a result, since there exists at least one scenario where the program may fail (non-integer values in the input list), the correctness of the program is compromised.

Correctness: **False**.
