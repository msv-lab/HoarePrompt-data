Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. The use of `set(lst)` returns only the unique elements from the list, which means it includes elements that appear only once, as well as those that may appear multiple times but are considered a single instance in the set.

For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the repeated element `1` is counted as a unique element. Thus, the function sums `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`, which does not meet the requirement to sum only non-repeated elements. 

Instead, to find the sum of non-repeated elements, the program would need to identify elements that occur exactly once and sum those. For instance, in the aforementioned list, only `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6` should be considered, leading to a sum of `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`.

Moreover, the test assertions given would be incorrect under the current implementation because they suggest the expected outcomes of sums that include repeated elements incorrectly as if they were unique.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the implementation does not follow the problem description accurately, hence the correctness is evaluated as **False**.
