To determine the correctness of the given program in relation to the problem description, we analyze the function `func_1(lst)`.

The problem requires the function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. In contrast, the implementation uses `sum(set(lst))`, which simply sums all unique elements in the list, regardless of whether they are repeated or not.

For example:

- Consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The non-repeated (unique) elements are only 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The correct sum of these non-repeated elements would be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`.
- The program, however, would return the sum of all unique elements as follows: `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`, which does not fulfill the requirement of summing only non-repeated elements.

This example demonstrates that the program does not correctly implement the desired functionality based on the problem description.

Thus, the program exhibits incorrect behavior. 

Correctness: **False**
