Final: **False**  

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(lst)` fails to meet the problem description's requirement of summing only non-repeated elements. The function correctly sums all unique elements but does not account for the requirement of excluding any element that appears more than once. As indicated in the examples provided in the original assessment, the computed sums do not match the expected output based on the definition of non-repeated elements. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the desired functionality according to the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
