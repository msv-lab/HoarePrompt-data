Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not fulfill the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list. The function `func_1(lst)` uses `set(lst)` which converts the list into a set of unique elements, followed by `sum(set(lst))`. This method results in summing all unique elements from the input list, but it does not exclude elements that appear more than once (i.e., it does not correctly handle the need to identify and sum only non-repeated elements).

For example, consider the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`. The non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`. The correct sum of those non-repeated elements should be `2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 20`. However, the program sums all unique values, yielding `21` (`1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6`), which is incorrect.

Additionally, the output hints mention the potential TypeError if `lst` contains non-integer values, indicating that the program does not handle cases where invalid types are included, but given the assumptions in the task, we focus on its primary functionality. 

Thus, the program fails to correctly compute the sum of non-repeated elements for certain inputs, leading to the conclusion that it does not meet the problem descriptionâ€™s requirements fully.
