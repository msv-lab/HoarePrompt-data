Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not meet the requirement laid out in the problem description. According to the problem, the goal is to find the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in the list. However, the implementation, which uses `sum(set(lst))`, sums all unique elements in the list rather than specifically the non-repeated elements. 

For example, in the case of the input list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the non-repeated elements are `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, and their sum is `20`. Instead, the program incorrectly sums `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`, resulting in a total of `21`. The output hints suggest that the function correctly handles cases with duplicates by reducing all duplicates to unique sums; however, it fails to distinguish between repeated and non-repeated elements as required by the problem description.

Thus, the function is incorrect in its current form and does not fulfill the requirements stipulated in the problem description.
