Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` attempts to find the sum of unique elements in the list, but it does not align with the problem description which specifically requests the sum of **non-repeated** elements. 

The current implementation uses `set(lst)`, which effectively retrieves unique elements from the list, but it does not filter out the elements that appear multiple times. For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the elements `1` is repeated multiple times and should not be included in the sum, whereas the output of the function would be `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21`, which counts `1` as a unique number rather than excluding it.

To correctly implement the function, it would need to check the occurrence of each element in the list and include only those that appear exactly once. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
