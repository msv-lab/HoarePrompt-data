The function accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It computes and returns the sum of unique integers found in `lst`. If `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, as there are no integers to sum. This means that the output will also be 0 in cases where all integers in the list are duplicates, as they will be reduced to a unique sum of zero items. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `lst` contains non-integer values, which may lead to a TypeError during the execution.
