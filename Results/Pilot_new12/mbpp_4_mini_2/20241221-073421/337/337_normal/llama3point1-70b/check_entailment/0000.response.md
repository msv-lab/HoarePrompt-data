Correctness: **True**. 

The given function correctly computes the sum of non-repeated elements in the provided list. It uses a generator expression to iterate through each element `i` in the list `lst`, checking if the count of `i` in `lst` is equal to 1 (which indicates it is non-repeated). The `sum` function then adds up all such non-repeated elements. 

Since it correctly handles all potential cases, including when there are all non-repeated elements, a mix of repeated and non-repeated elements, or even when the list is empty, the code behaves as specified in the problem description. There are no missed edge cases that would lead to incorrect results.
