Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. The function `func_1(lst)` calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in the given list `lst`. It uses a generator expression that iterates through each element `i` in `lst` and checks whether the count of `i` in `lst` is exactly one using `lst.count(i)`. 

Here's why it always meets the problem description requirements:

1. **Non-Repeated Elements**: The condition `lst.count(i) == 1` filters out only those elements which appear exactly once in the list.

2. **Summation**: The built-in `sum()` function computes the total of these non-repeated elements, thus fulfilling the requirement to find their sum.

The function will always produce the correct sum of non-repeated elements as long as a valid list of integers is provided, adhering strictly to the problem description. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program correctly meets the problem requirements.
