Correctness: **True**

The program calculates the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in a given list according to the problem description. It uses a generator expression that only includes integers that appear exactly once in the list, which is aligned with the problem requirements. 

The output hints correctly state that the function returns 0 for an empty list, and that the `count` method allows the function to identify unique integers. Although the approach may not be the most efficient for large lists, it does not affect the correctness in terms of meeting the specified requirements.

All potential input cases, including an empty list, are handled appropriately, returning 0, which is the expected sum of unique integers in that scenario. Unique integers are correctly identified, and their sums are accurately computed.

Since the program meets the described requirements across all potential cases considered valid inputs, the correctness is verified as true.
