Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The original assessment's conclusion that the function correctly computes this sum is supported by the annotated version of the code, which clearly describes the function's behavior and confirms that it effectively identifies integers that appear exactly once in the list.

The annotations affirm that the function operates as intended, summing the integers that are unique in the input list. Furthermore, the assessment rightly comments on the behavior of the function when the input list is empty, noting that the sum will be zero, which aligns with the expected behavior when there are no unique integers.

While there are potential inefficiencies due to the repeated use of the `count` method, this does not affect the correctness of the result provided the input adheres to the specified conditions. Thus, the function fulfills the problem description accurately, making the original assessment true.
