The original assessment states that the program is correct, which aligns with the problem description. The function is designed to compute the sum of non-repeated elements in a provided list.

The annotated code also observes that the function "returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear exactly once," which further confirms that the implementation fulfills the requirements of the problem description.

The reasoning provided in the original assessment supports the conclusion that the function behaves correctly under various scenarios, such as empty lists or mixed content lists, as it properly identifies and sums the non-repeated elements.

There are no contradictions between the annotated state of the program and the original assessment, and both confirm that the function satisfies the problem's specifications.

Final: **True**
