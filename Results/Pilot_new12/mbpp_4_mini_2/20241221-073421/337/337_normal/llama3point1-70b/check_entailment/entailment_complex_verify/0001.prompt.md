You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    return sum((i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1))


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze it.

The problem description requires a function that finds the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. 

The program `func_1` implements this logic using a generator expression to iterate over the list (`lst`) and sums up the elements that appear exactly once.

1. The line `lst.count(i) == 1` counts the occurrences of each element `i` in the list. 
2. If `i` appears only once (`count == 1`), it is included in the sum.

### Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider a few test cases:

1. **Empty List:**
   - Input: `[]`
   - Expected Output: `0` (since there are no elements)
   - Program Output: `sum([])` returns `0`. Correct.

2. **Single Element List:**
   - Input: `[5]`
   - Expected Output: `5` (5 appears once)
   - Program Output: `5`. Correct.

3. **List with Non-Repeated Elements:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `6` (1, 2, and 3 are all non-repeated)
   - Program Output: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. Correct.

4. **List with Repeated Elements:**
   - Input: `[1, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `5` (2 and 3 are non-repeated, 1 is repeated)
   - Program Output: `2 + 3 = 5`. Correct.

5. **All Elements Repeated:**
   - Input: `[1, 1, 2, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `0` (no non-repeated elements)
   - Program Output: `0`. Correct.

6. **Mixed Elements:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]`
   - Expected Output: `1 + 3 + 5 = 9` (1 and 3 and 5 are non-repeated)
   - Program Output: `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`. Correct.

### Possible Concerns:
- The use of `lst.count(i)` is inefficient as it has a time complexity of O(n) for each element. The overall time complexity can be O(n^2) in the worst case (where `n` is the number of elements in `lst`).
  
However, the program correctly computes the required sum based on the provided problem description for all examined cases.

Since we cannot find any case where the program does not behave as expected according to the problem description, the function appears to handle all scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, 'lst', and computes the sum of all integers that appear exactly once in the list. It utilizes the 'count' method to filter these integers. However, this approach can lead to inefficiencies for large lists due to the repetitive counting of elements. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where 'lst' is empty, as the sum of an empty list will simply be zero, which is implicitly accounted for and is consistent with the expected behavior. Overall, the function effectively identifies unique integers and calculates their sum, returning 0 if there are no unique integers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
