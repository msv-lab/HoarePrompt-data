Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here’s why it fulfills the requirements:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers `lst` and computes the sum of integers that appear exactly once in the list. This matches the requirement of finding the sum of non-repeated elements, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Use of Count Method**: The program utilizes a generator expression combined with the `sum` function. The generator checks each integer `i` in the list and sums it only if its count in `lst` is equal to 1. This effectively filters for unique elements and yields their sum.

3. **Handling Empty Lists**: When the input list is empty, the `sum` function correctly returns 0, which aligns with the expected behavior mentioned in the annotations. 

4. **Efficiency Consideration**: The annotations note the potential inefficiency of using `count` on each iteration, especially for larger lists. While this can lead to performance issues, it does not affect the correctness of the program regarding the calculated output.

In conclusion, given the assumptions that the input will be valid and adhere to the specified format, the function consistently fulfills the problem’s requirements by accurately summing only the non-repeated elements in the provided list.
