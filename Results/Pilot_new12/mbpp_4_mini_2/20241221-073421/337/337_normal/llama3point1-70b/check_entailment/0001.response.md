To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze it.

The problem description requires a function that finds the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. 

The program `func_1` implements this logic using a generator expression to iterate over the list (`lst`) and sums up the elements that appear exactly once.

1. The line `lst.count(i) == 1` counts the occurrences of each element `i` in the list. 
2. If `i` appears only once (`count == 1`), it is included in the sum.

### Test Case Analysis:
Let's consider a few test cases:

1. **Empty List:**
   - Input: `[]`
   - Expected Output: `0` (since there are no elements)
   - Program Output: `sum([])` returns `0`. Correct.

2. **Single Element List:**
   - Input: `[5]`
   - Expected Output: `5` (5 appears once)
   - Program Output: `5`. Correct.

3. **List with Non-Repeated Elements:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `6` (1, 2, and 3 are all non-repeated)
   - Program Output: `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`. Correct.

4. **List with Repeated Elements:**
   - Input: `[1, 1, 2, 3]`
   - Expected Output: `5` (2 and 3 are non-repeated, 1 is repeated)
   - Program Output: `2 + 3 = 5`. Correct.

5. **All Elements Repeated:**
   - Input: `[1, 1, 2, 2]`
   - Expected Output: `0` (no non-repeated elements)
   - Program Output: `0`. Correct.

6. **Mixed Elements:**
   - Input: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5]`
   - Expected Output: `1 + 3 + 5 = 9` (1 and 3 and 5 are non-repeated)
   - Program Output: `1 + 3 + 5 = 9`. Correct.

### Possible Concerns:
- The use of `lst.count(i)` is inefficient as it has a time complexity of O(n) for each element. The overall time complexity can be O(n^2) in the worst case (where `n` is the number of elements in `lst`).
  
However, the program correctly computes the required sum based on the provided problem description for all examined cases.

Since we cannot find any case where the program does not behave as expected according to the problem description, the function appears to handle all scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **True**
