The original assessment accurately identifies that the program satisfies the problem description, as the function computes the sum of non-repeated elements in the list correctly. Each test case provided supports the conclusion that the program operates as expected, returning the correct sum of elements that appear exactly once.

The output hints reinforce this perspective. They clarify that the function handles empty lists appropriately by returning 0, which aligns with the expected behavior. The mention of potential inefficiencies due to the use of `lst.count(i)` is a valid concern, but inefficiency does not equate to incorrectness, and the functional requirements are still met.

Given these considerations, the original assessment remains valid since the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description without encountering any unexpected behaviors as demonstrated in the test cases.

Final: **True**
