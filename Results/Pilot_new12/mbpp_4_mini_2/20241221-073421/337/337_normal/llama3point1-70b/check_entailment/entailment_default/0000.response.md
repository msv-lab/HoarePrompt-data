The program is designed to sum the non-repeated elements in a given list. It does so by using a generator expression within the `sum` function to filter out the elements that appear exactly once in the input list.

Examining the output hints, they clarify that the function effectively computes this sum but may be inefficient for larger lists due to repeated calls to the `count` method, which indeed checks each element's frequency in the list multiple times.

As per the problem description, the function should calculate the sum of non-repeated elements, which it does successfully, returning zero if there are no such elements or if the list is empty (since summing an empty list in Python naturally results in zero). 

The output hints also confirm that the function correctly identifies unique integers and sums them up, with the acknowledgment that calling `lst.count(i)` for each element can lead to performance concerns with large lists.

However, the core logic aligns well with the problem requirements and expected behavior in both ordinary and edge cases, such as an empty list.

Based on this evaluation, the program fulfills the problem description in all cases tested or anticipated. Thus, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**.
