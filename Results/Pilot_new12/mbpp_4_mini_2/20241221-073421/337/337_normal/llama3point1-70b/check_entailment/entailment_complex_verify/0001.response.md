Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program, `func_1`, meets the requirements of the problem description by accurately calculating the sum of non-repeated elements in the list. The annotated version of the code reaffirms this correctness, as it describes the function's behavior in line with the expected output for various test cases.

The annotations highlight that the function:

1. Accepts a valid list of integers.
2. Uses a generator expression to filter and sum up integers that appear exactly once.
3. Properly returns `0` when the input list is empty, which is consistent with the expected behavior.
4. Identifies and sums the unique integers correctly, as demonstrated in multiple test scenarios.

Despite mentioning potential inefficiencies in handling larger lists due to the `count` method being called multiple times, this does not affect the current correctness of the functionality as per the problem description. The function works as required, producing correct outputs even with repeating elements or empty lists.

Thus, the conclusion that the function is correct according to the original assessment stands valid.
