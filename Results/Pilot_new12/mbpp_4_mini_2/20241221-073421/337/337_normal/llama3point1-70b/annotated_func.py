#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear exactly once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, 'lst', and computes the sum of all integers that appear exactly once in the list. It utilizes the 'count' method to filter these integers. However, this approach can lead to inefficiencies for large lists due to the repetitive counting of elements. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where 'lst' is empty, as the sum of an empty list will simply be zero, which is implicitly accounted for and is consistent with the expected behavior. Overall, the function effectively identifies unique integers and calculates their sum, returning 0 if there are no unique integers.
