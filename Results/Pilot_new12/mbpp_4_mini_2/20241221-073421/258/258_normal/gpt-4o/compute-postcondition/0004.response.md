The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. The function checks whether the `armstrong_sum`, which is the sum of each digit in the string representation of `n` raised to the power of the length of that string, is equal to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return a boolean indicating whether the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to `n`.  

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns a boolean indicating whether the armstrong_sum of the digits of n raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to n.**
