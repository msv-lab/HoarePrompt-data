`num_len` is assigned the value `len(num_str)`, which is the length of the string representation of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` will have a length that corresponds to the number of digits in `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.**
