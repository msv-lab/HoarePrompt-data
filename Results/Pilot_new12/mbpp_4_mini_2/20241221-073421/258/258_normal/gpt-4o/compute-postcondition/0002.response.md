The `armstrong_sum` is computed by summing the result of raising each digit in `num_str` (which represents the number `n`) to the power of `num_len` (the number of digits in `n`). Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is its string representation, and `num_len` is the length of that string.

- The value of `num_str` can be inferred from `n`. If `n` is `0`, then `num_str` is `"0"` and `num_len` is `1`. For any other non-negative integer, letâ€™s denote it generically as `n`, then `num_str` would be the string representation of `n`, and `num_len` would be the count of characters in `num_str` (which is equal to the number of digits in `n`).
- The `armstrong_sum` for an Armstrong number of order `num_len` is the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len`.

Therefore, `armstrong_sum` is calculated as follows:
- If `n` has digits `d1, d2, ..., dk`, then:
  \[
  armstrong\_sum = d1^{num\_len} + d2^{num\_len} + ... + dk^{num\_len}
  \]
  
The initial value of `n` remains unchanged and will still be a non-negative integer; `num_str` will stay a string representation of `n`, and `num_len` will continue to reflect the number of digits in `n`. However, `armstrong_sum` will now have a specific computed value.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `n`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`, `armstrong_sum` is the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
