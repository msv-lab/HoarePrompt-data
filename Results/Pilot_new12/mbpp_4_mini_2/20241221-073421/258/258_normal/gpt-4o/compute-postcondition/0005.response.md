Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks whether `n` is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or Narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function converts `n` to a string to access its digits, computes the number of digits, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total count of digits, and returns a boolean indicating if this sum equals `n`. It correctly handles all non-negative integers, including 0 and single-digit numbers, as they qualify as Armstrong numbers. The boolean result indicates whether the input `n` meets the Armstrong criteria.**
