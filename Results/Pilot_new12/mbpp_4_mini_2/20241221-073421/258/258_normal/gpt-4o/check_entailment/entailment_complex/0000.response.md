Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description, which is to check if a given number is an Armstrong number.

Here's a breakdown of why the implementation is correct:

1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number for a given number of digits is one that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. This is correctly captured in the program.

2. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`, as stated in the annotations. The assertion that `n` is a non-negative integer ensures it handles only valid inputs as per the problem statement.

3. **String Conversion**: The program converts the integer `n` to a string to access and manipulate its individual digits, which is valid for determining Armstrong numbers.

4. **Calculation**: It calculates the number of digits (`num_len`) in `n` and then computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len`. This logic correctly reflects the Armstrong number calculation.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns a boolean indicating whether the calculated sum (`armstrong_sum`) is equal to `n`. This directly addresses the requirement of checking if `n` is an Armstrong number.

6. **Coverage of Cases**: The program correctly handles the required cases, including single-digit numbers and zero, as all single-digit numbers (0-9) are Armstrong numbers by definition.

7. **Assertions**: The provided assertions further help validate the function by testing it against known Armstrong numbers (like 153) and non-Armstrong numbers (like 259 and 4458), confirming the correctness of the output.

Thus, since the function operates correctly according to the problem description and requirements, the conclusion is that the program is indeed correct.
