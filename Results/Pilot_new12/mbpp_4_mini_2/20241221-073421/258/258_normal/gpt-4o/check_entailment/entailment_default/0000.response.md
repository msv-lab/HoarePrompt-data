The provided program aims to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number, which is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

The program description states that it should handle all non-negative integers, including 0 and single-digit numbers. The sample assertions also include checks for 153 (an Armstrong number), 259 (not an Armstrong number), and 4458 (not an Armstrong number).

The code uses the following logic:

1. Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit.
2. Calculate the number of digits in the number.
3. Compute the sum of each digit raised to the power equal to the number of digits.
4. Return a boolean indicating whether this sum equals the original number.

The output hints confirm that the program correctly identifies Armstrong numbers by checking each digit and using the formula described. The hints also mention that it handles non-negative integers and covers single-digit inputs, which are Armstrong numbers by definition.

The program appears to be correctly implemented based on both the problem description and the output hints. Therefore, there doesn't seem to be any edge cases or scenarios that would cause the function to fail.

Correctness: **True**.
