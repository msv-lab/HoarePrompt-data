You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
    return armstrong_sum == n
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether armstrong_sum, which is the sum of each digit in num_str raised to the power of num_len, is equal to n, where n is a non-negative integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks whether `n` is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or Narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function converts `n` to a string to access its digits, computes the number of digits, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total count of digits, and returns a boolean indicating if this sum equals `n`. It correctly handles all non-negative integers, including 0 and single-digit numbers, as they qualify as Armstrong numbers. The boolean result indicates whether the input `n` meets the Armstrong criteria.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
