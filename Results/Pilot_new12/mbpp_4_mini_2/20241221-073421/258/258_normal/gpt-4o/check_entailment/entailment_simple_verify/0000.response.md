Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number, as defined in the problem description. The annotated version of the code supports this conclusion by confirming that the variable `n` is correctly used as a non-negative integer and that the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the computed Armstrong sum matches `n`. Furthermore, the test cases provided in the assertions align with the expected outcomes, confirming that the function handles the definitions of an Armstrong number correctly. Therefore, the program meets the criteria outlined in the problem description.
