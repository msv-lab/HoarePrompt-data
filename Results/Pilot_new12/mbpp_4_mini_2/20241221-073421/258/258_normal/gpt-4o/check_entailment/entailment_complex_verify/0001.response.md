The original assessment states that the program is correct. Analyzing the annotated version of the code along with the initial assessment and the problem description confirms this conclusion.

1. The function `func_1` is well-defined to check if a number is an Armstrong number.
2. The function correctly:
   - Accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
   - Converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit.
   - Computes the length of this string (i.e., the number of digits).
   - Sums each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
   - Returns a boolean indicating whether this sum equals the original number.
3. The annotated code further clarifies that it handles non-negative integers, including all edge cases such as single-digit numbers, which are also considered Armstrong numbers.
4. The assertions confirm that the function works correctly for the given test cases.

The problem description aligns with the function's purpose, and the annotations illustrate the function's intended behavior accurately. Therefore, there are no discrepancies or edge cases found that would affect the correctness of the program based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
