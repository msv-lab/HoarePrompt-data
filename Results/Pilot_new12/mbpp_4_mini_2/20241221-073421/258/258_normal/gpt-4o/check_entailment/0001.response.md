Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements a function to check if a given number is an Armstrong number. Here’s why I believe it’s correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It converts `n` to a string to easily iterate through each digit.
3. The length of the string is determined to know the number of digits.
4. It then calculates the Armstrong sum by raising each digit to the power of the number of digits (length) and summing those values.
5. Finally, it checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number, returning `True` if they are equal (indicating it's an Armstrong number) and `False` otherwise.

The assertions provided:
- `func_1(153)` returns `True` because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.
- `func_1(259)` returns `False` because 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 does not equal 259.
- `func_1(4458)` returns `False` because 4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 does not equal 4458.

I cannot find any edge cases or examples where the function would not perform correctly as per the problem description. Thus, the program is indeed correct in handling Armstrong numbers for the provided cases and according to the definition of Armstrong numbers.
