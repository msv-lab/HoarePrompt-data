Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness accurately reflects the function's behavior in relation to the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether an input number is an Armstrong number by following these steps:

1. It converts the input number `n` into a string to isolate its digits.
2. It calculates the length of the string, which corresponds to the number of digits in `n`.
3. It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power equal to the number of digits and checks if this sum equals the original number.

The annotated version confirms that the function handles non-negative integers properly and meets the requirements of the problem description. All assertions provided (including for numbers like 0 and single-digit numbers) validate the functionality of the code.

Since there is consistency between the annotations, the original assessment, and the behavior of the program with respect to its intended purpose (checking Armstrong numbers), the final correctness of the program is confirmed to be accurate.
