Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the necessary logic to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number based on the problem description. The annotations provided in the annotated version support this assessment, confirming that the variable `n` is a non-negative integer and that the function evaluates the Armstrong condition correctly. 

The annotations specify that the function calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits and compares this sum to the original number `n`. The assertions check known Armstrong numbers and non-Armstrong numbers, and the program correctly provides expected outputs for these cases.

Therefore, the program behaves as intended and meets the problem description, reaffirming the original assessment of correctness.
