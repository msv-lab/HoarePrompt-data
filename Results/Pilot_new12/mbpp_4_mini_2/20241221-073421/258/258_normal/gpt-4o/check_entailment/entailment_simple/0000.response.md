Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number. 

Hereâ€™s the explanation:

1. **Definition of Armstrong Number**: An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) for a number with `n` digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of `n`. For example, \(153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3\).

2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1(n)` converts the input number `n` to a string to facilitate the processing of its digits.
   - It calculates the number of digits (`num_len`) in the number.
   - It computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len` using a generator expression inside the `sum` function.
   - Finally, it checks if this computed sum is equal to the original number `n` and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

3. **Testing**:
   - The assertions provided in the program test the function with specific known Armstrong numbers, verifying the implementation against expected outcomes. The number `153` is an Armstrong number (the function should return `True`), while `259` and `4458` are not (the function should return `False` for both).

Since the function correctly checks for Armstrong numbers according to the definition and returns the expected results for the provided test cases, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Thus, it is correct.
