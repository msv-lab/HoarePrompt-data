The original assessment stated that the program correctly implements a function to check if a given number is an Armstrong number, and it provided reasoning supporting this claim. 

Upon evaluation, the program seems to meet the problem description as it correctly implements the algorithm to determine if a number is an Armstrong number. The function:
1. Accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
2. Converts `n` to a string to easily access each digit.
3. Computes the number of digits in `n`.
4. Calculates the Armstrong sum by raising each digit to the power of the number of digits and summing these values.
5. Returns `True` if this sum equals `n`, otherwise returns `False`.

The output hints confirm that the function handles non-negative integers correctly, including edge cases such as 0 and single-digit numbers, which are also Armstrong numbers because they equal themselves when raised to the power of one.

The assertions provided for various test cases are also accurate:
- For `func_1(153)`, it correctly returns `True` as 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.
- For `func_1(259)`, it returns `False`, which is accurate since 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 does not equal 259.
- For `func_1(4458)`, it returns `False`, which is also correct as 4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 does not equal 4458.

Since all aspects of the program align with the problem description and the function operates correctly as validated by the output hints and supplied assertions, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

Thus, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:
Final: **True**
