You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements a function to check if a given number is an Armstrong number. Here’s why I believe it’s correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It converts `n` to a string to easily iterate through each digit.
3. The length of the string is determined to know the number of digits.
4. It then calculates the Armstrong sum by raising each digit to the power of the number of digits (length) and summing those values.
5. Finally, it checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number, returning `True` if they are equal (indicating it's an Armstrong number) and `False` otherwise.

The assertions provided:
- `func_1(153)` returns `True` because 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153.
- `func_1(259)` returns `False` because 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 does not equal 259.
- `func_1(4458)` returns `False` because 4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 does not equal 4458.

I cannot find any edge cases or examples where the function would not perform correctly as per the problem description. Thus, the program is indeed correct in handling Armstrong numbers for the provided cases and according to the definition of Armstrong numbers.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks whether `n` is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or Narcissistic number) for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The function converts `n` to a string to access its digits, computes the number of digits, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total count of digits, and returns a boolean indicating if this sum equals `n`. It correctly handles all non-negative integers, including 0 and single-digit numbers, as they qualify as Armstrong numbers. The boolean result indicates whether the input `n` meets the Armstrong criteria.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
