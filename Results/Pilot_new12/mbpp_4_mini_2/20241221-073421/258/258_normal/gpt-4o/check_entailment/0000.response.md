Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). 

Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. The function converts the number `n` to a string and calculates its length (the number of digits).
2. It then calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits.
3. Finally, it checks if this computed sum is equal to the original number `n`.

The examples provided in the assertions are validated correctly:
- `func_1(153)` returns `True` because \( 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153 \).
- `func_1(259)` returns `False` because \( 2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 \neq 259 \).
- `func_1(4458)` returns `False` because \( 4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 \neq 4458 \).

Since the function performs the required checks correctly for various test cases, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
