Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the checks to determine if a number is an Armstrong number. It does this by:

1. Converting the number to a string to access its individual digits.
2. Calculating the length of this string to determine the number of digits.
3. Raising each digit to the power of the number of digits and summing these values.
4. Returning whether this sum equals the original number.

The output hints confirm that the program correctly handles all non-negative integers, including the special cases of 0 and single-digit numbers (which are indeed Armstrong numbers). The assertions provided in the code (with inputs like 153 and 259) are additional tests that validate the implementation. 

Since the code is robust in handling all specified cases, including edge cases, I conclude the correctness of the program is valid for the problem it aims to solve.
