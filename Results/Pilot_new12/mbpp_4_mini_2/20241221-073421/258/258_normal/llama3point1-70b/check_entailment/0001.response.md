Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1(num)` correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). 

An Armstrong number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits. The function works as follows:

1. It converts the number to a string to easily access each digit and calculates the number of digits (`num_len`).
2. It initializes a variable `sum` to accumulate the sum of the digits raised to the power of `num_len`.
3. It iterates through each digit of the number, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and adds that to `sum`.
4. Finally, it compares the accumulated `sum` to the original number and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that it is an Armstrong number, or `False` otherwise.

The code handles single-digit numbers correctly (as all single-digit numbers are Armstrong numbers) and also correctly processes multi-digit numbers, including edge cases like 0. 

I couldn't find any input case that the function does not handle appropriately according to the given problem description. Therefore, it behaves correctly for all potential cases related to the definition of an Armstrong number.
