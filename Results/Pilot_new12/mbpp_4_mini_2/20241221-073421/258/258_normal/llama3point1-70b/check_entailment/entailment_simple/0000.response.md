Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). An Armstrong number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Here's how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a non-negative integer `num`, which aligns with the problem description.
   
2. **String Conversion and Length Calculation**: The program converts `num` into its string representation to easily iterate over each digit, and it calculates the length (`num_len`) of this representation to determine the power each digit should be raised to.

3. **Digit Processing**: Inside the loop, the program iterates through each digit of the number, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and accumulates the result in the variable `sum`.

4. **Return Statement**: After the loop, the program checks if `sum` is equal to `num`. If they are equal, it returns `True` indicating that `num` is indeed an Armstrong number; otherwise, it returns `False`.

Since the program logic correctly implements the mathematical definition of an Armstrong number for all non-negative integers, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
