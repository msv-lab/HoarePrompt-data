You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1(num)` correctly implements the logic to determine whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). 

An Armstrong number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits raised to the power of the number of digits. The function works as follows:

1. It converts the number to a string to easily access each digit and calculates the number of digits (`num_len`).
2. It initializes a variable `sum` to accumulate the sum of the digits raised to the power of `num_len`.
3. It iterates through each digit of the number, converts it back to an integer, raises it to the power of `num_len`, and adds that to `sum`.
4. Finally, it compares the accumulated `sum` to the original number and returns `True` if they are equal, indicating that it is an Armstrong number, or `False` otherwise.

The code handles single-digit numbers correctly (as all single-digit numbers are Armstrong numbers) and also correctly processes multi-digit numbers, including edge cases like 0. 

I couldn't find any input case that the function does not handle appropriately according to the given problem description. Therefore, it behaves correctly for all potential cases related to the definition of an Armstrong number.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `num` as input and checks whether `num` is a narcissistic number. A narcissistic number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the total number of digits in the number. The function does this by converting `num` to a string to extract its digits, calculating the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and then comparing this sum to the original number. It returns `True` if `num` is a narcissistic number and `False` otherwise. The function assumes that the input will always be a non-negative integer, so it does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
