Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(num)` correctly implements the logic for determining whether a given number is an Armstrong number. The reasoning provided in the original assessment aligns well with the problem description and the behavior of the program. The output hints confirm that the function is designed to handle non-negative integers as specified and correctly computes whether the input number meets the criteria for being a narcissistic number. 

Specifically, it correctly sums the digits of the input number raised to the power of the number of digits, and returns `True` if this sum equals the original number and `False` otherwise. Given that the function assumes valid non-negative integer input, which is in line with the problem description, it therefore meets all specified requirements reliably. Consequently, there are no identified flaws in its implementation.
