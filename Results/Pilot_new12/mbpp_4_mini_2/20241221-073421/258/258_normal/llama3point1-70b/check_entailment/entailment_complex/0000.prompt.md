You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is equal to the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.
    return sum == num
    #The program returns True if sum, which is the sum of each digit of num raised to the power of num_len, is equal to num, indicating that num is a narcissistic number.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `num` as input and checks whether `num` is a narcissistic number. A narcissistic number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the total number of digits in the number. The function does this by converting `num` to a string to extract its digits, calculating the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and then comparing this sum to the original number. It returns `True` if `num` is a narcissistic number and `False` otherwise. The function assumes that the input will always be a non-negative integer, so it does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
