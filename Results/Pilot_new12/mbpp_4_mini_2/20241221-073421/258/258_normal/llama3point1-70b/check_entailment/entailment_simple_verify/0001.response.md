Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(num)` implements the correct logic to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number based on the defined criteria in the problem description. The annotated version of the code reinforces this by clearly stating the state of the program before and after the execution of the for loop. It confirms that the function correctly sums the digits raised to the power of the number of digits and accurately compares this sum to the original number. Given the assumption that the input will be a valid non-negative integer, the program meets the criteria for determining Armstrong numbers, thus validating the original assessment of correctness.
