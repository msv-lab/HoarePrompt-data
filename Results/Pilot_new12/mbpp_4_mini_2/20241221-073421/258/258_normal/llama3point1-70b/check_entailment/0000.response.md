Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if a given number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (or narcissistic number) is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its digits raised to the power of the number of digits.

The function `func_1(num)` takes an integer, converts it to a string to iterate through the digits, calculates the number of digits, and then computes the sum of each digit raised to that power. Finally, it checks if this sum equals the original number.

I cannot find any case where this program does not meet the problem description. The logic applied is sound for all numbers, including edge cases like single-digit numbers (which are all Armstrong numbers) and larger numbers. Thus, the code works correctly for all potential inputs according to the problem description.
