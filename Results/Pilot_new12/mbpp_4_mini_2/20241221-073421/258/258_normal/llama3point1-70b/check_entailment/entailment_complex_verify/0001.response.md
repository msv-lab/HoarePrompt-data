Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** remains accurate. The annotated code supports this conclusion by confirming that the program correctly implements the logic for determining whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong (narcissistic) number:

1. The input is specified to be a non-negative integer, which the function handles appropriately.
2. The program converts this integer to a string to easily access each digit, calculates the number of digits, and initializes a variable to accumulate the sum.
3. It correctly iterates through each digit, computes the digit raised to the power of the total digit count, and adds this to the sum.
4. Finally, it accurately checks if this sum equals the original number, returning `True` for Armstrong numbers and `False` otherwise.

The annotations further reinforce that after executing the loop, the values of `num`, `num_str`, and `num_len` maintain their expected relationships, providing confidence in the correctness of the program's functionality per the problem description. 

Overall, since the function passes all relevant checks for Armstrong numbers and assumes valid input as stated in the problem, the conclusion of the program's correctness stands as evaluated.
