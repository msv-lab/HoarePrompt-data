Correctness: **False**

The program checks whether a given non-negative integer `num` is an Armstrong (or narcissistic) number correctly for valid non-negative integers. However, the program description explicitly states that the function assumes the input will always be a non-negative integer, meaning it does not handle edge cases where the input could be negative numbers or non-integer values.

Although it might not raise errors for negative inputs under the current implementation, it is incorrect according to the problem description as it fails to account for potential cases of invalid input. For instance, if `num` were to be `-153`, the program would proceed with the calculation, returning `False`, even though the ARMSTRONG number definition does not accommodate negative integers. 

Thus, since the program does not satisfy the requirements for every potential case (specifically not handling negative numbers), the correctness is deemed **False**.
