`num_len` is assigned the value of the length of `num_str`. Since `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is equal to the number of digits in `num`. The value of `num` remains a non-negative integer, and `num_str` remains the string representation of that non-negative integer.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`.**
