According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string representation of `num` and the variable `num_len`. If `num_len` is greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute multiple times for each digit in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `num_len` is at least 2, meaning there are at least 2 digits left in `num_str` for the loop to iterate over. 

If `num_str` has at least 2 digits, then for the loop to execute one more time, it should be on the second digit (in total the loop has iterated for each digit until all are used). If we have already processed one digit in the current iteration, the next digit corresponds to the next index position in the loop.

Therefore, after processing the first digit, the loop will be ready to process the next digit in `num_str`. 

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` must be greater than or equal to 1, sum is now equal to `0 + (int(digit)) + (int(digit))`**
