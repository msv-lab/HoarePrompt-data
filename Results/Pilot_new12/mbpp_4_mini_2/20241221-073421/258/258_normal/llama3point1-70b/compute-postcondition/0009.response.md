Initial State: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is 0.  
Code of the loop:  
```
for digit in num_str:
    sum += int(digit) ** num_len
```

The loop iterates over each digit in `num_str`, which corresponds to the digits of `num`. The variable `num_len` is equal to the length of `num_str`, which represents the number of digits in `num`. After all iterations of the loop have executed, `sum` will equal the sum of each digit in `num`, raised to the power of `num_len`.

If `num` is a non-negative integer, then `num_str` will have at least one digit, and the loop will execute `num_len` times, which is at least 1. 

Therefore, after the loop executes completely:
- `num` remains a non-negative integer as originally defined,
- `num_str` is the string representation of `num`,
- `num_len` is equal to the number of digits in `num`,
- `sum` is equal to the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.

Taking these details into account, we arrive at the following output state:

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is equal to the sum of each digit of `num` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
