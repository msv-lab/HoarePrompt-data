To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the given state before the loop starts along with the for loop statement:

1. The loop iterates over `num_str`, which is the string representation of `num`.
2. For the loop to execute at least once, `num_str` must contain at least one character (digit).
3. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, its string representation is guaranteed to be either empty (if `num` is 0) or contain digits (if `num` is greater than 0).
4. If `num` is 0, then `num_str` would be "0", which still allows the loop to execute once.
5. The initial value of `sum` is 0, and its value will be updated during the iterations, but this does not affect the ability of the loop to start executing.

Thus, the relevant states are:
- `num_str` should not be empty.
- At the start of the loop, `digit` will be the first character (digit) in `num_str` when the loop begins.

Given this analysis, the adjustments we require are relatively simple.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is 0, `digit` is the first character in `num_str`**
