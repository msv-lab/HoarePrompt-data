The variable `sum` is updated by adding `int(digit) ** num_len` to its previous value. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` correctly represents that integer, and `num_len` is greater than or equal to 2, `int(digit)` will yield a non-negative integer based on the characters in `num_str`. The value of `sum` is modified from its previous value, which is `0 + (int(digit))`, to include the new computation.

The impact on the program is:
- The previous value of `sum` (which was `0 + (int(digit))`) will be incremented by `int(digit) ** num_len`.

Thus, the new value of `sum` becomes `0 + (int(digit)) + (int(digit) ** num_len)`.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is now equal to `0 + (int(digit)) + (int(digit) ** num_len)`**.
