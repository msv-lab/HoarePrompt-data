Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `num` as input and checks whether `num` is a narcissistic number. A narcissistic number is defined as a number that is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the total number of digits in the number. The function does this by converting `num` to a string to extract its digits, calculating the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and then comparing this sum to the original number. It returns `True` if `num` is a narcissistic number and `False` otherwise. The function assumes that the input will always be a non-negative integer, so it does not handle negative numbers or non-integer inputs.**
