`sum` is updated by adding the value of `int(digit) ** num_len` to its previous value. The variable `digit` represents the first character of `num_str`, which is the string representation of `num`. Since `num` is a non-negative integer and `num_len` is greater than or equal to 1, `int(digit)` will give a non-negative integer as well. The calculated value being added to `sum` is thus `int(digit) ** num_len`.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, if `digit` is the first character of `num_str`, then `int(digit)` equals `num`. 

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is greater than or equal to 1, `sum` is equal to `0 + (int(digit) ** num_len)` and `digit` is the first character in `num_str`.**
