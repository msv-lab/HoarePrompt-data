According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string representation of `num`, which is `num_str`. Each iteration of the loop processes one digit from this string. Since `num_len` is greater than or equal to 1, and we know that `num_str` has been processed up to a certain point, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that there is at least one more digit left to process.

Given that `num_len` is greater than or equal to 1, and it's implied that we've processed at least one digit (since `sum` is defined by adding converted digits), if `num_len` is currently at `len(num_str)`, we can assume that during the last iteration, we processed the digit at the current index that is one less than `num_len`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, we should have:

- The next `digit` to process is at index equal to the current count of processed digits, which is equal to the length of `num_str` minus 1. Therefore, the next `digit` will be from `num_str` where the index is equal to the current processed count.
- Since we don't know how many digits have been processed, but `num_len` indicates that there are still digits left, we will adjust the `num_len` for the next iteration.

Thus, the required state adjustments are as follows: For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions on the state are that `num_len` needs to reflect the number of digits left to process. After processing the last digit in that iteration, `num_len` must decrease.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is greater than or equal to 2, `sum` is equal to `0 + (int(digit))` (for the next processed digit)**
