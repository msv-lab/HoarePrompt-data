The code assigns the value of `num` converted to a string to the variable `num_str`. Since `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` will be its string representation. The state of `num` remains unchanged, while `num_str` takes on the new string value. 

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.**
