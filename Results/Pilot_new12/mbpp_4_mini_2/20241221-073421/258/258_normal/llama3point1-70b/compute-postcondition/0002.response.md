The variable `sum` is initialized to 0. This assignment does not affect any other variables, and no calculations are performed involving `num`, `num_str`, or `num_len`. Therefore, the output state will simply reflect the new value of `sum` along with the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is 0**.
