#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length, containing numeric values.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the differences between the corresponding elements of 'tup1' and 'tup2'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which must be of the same length and contain numeric values. It returns a new tuple that consists of the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. If the input tuples contain any non-numeric values, the behavior of the function is not defined, as it does not handle such cases. Additionally, if the tuples are of different lengths, it will raise a `ValueError` due to the `zip` function only pairing elements until the shortest input is exhausted, resulting in potentially unintended behavior.
