The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length, containing numeric values. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the differences between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of numeric values of the same length and return a tuple that represents the differences between their corresponding elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples of the same length containing numeric values and returns a tuple containing the differences between the corresponding elements of the input tuples.**
