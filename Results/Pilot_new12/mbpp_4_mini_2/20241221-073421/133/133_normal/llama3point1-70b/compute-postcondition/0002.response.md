Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which must be of the same length and contain numeric values. It returns a new tuple that consists of the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. If the input tuples contain any non-numeric values, the behavior of the function is not defined, as it does not handle such cases. Additionally, if the tuples are of different lengths, it will raise a `ValueError` due to the `zip` function only pairing elements until the shortest input is exhausted, resulting in potentially unintended behavior.**
