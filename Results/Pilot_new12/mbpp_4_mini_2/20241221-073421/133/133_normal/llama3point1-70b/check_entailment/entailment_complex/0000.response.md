Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the described functionality. It takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` and assumes they are of the same length and contain numeric values, as stated in the problem description. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` function to compute the difference between corresponding elements from both tuples using `zip`, which pairs elements based on their indices.

Here's why the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Same Length Tuples**: The program assumes that both tuples are of the same length. This is a necessary condition for proper element-wise subtraction, which the annotations confirm.
2. **Numeric Values**: It presumes the tuples contain numeric values. The program does not handle non-numeric values, but this is acceptable given the problem description's assumption about valid input.
3. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The use of `zip` allows for iteration over both tuples in parallel, and the expression `a - b` computes the difference between corresponding elements as intended.
4. **Return Type**: Finally, the result is returned as a new tuple of differences, which aligns perfectly with the requirement of returning the differences of the input tuples.

Since all the requirements in the problem description are met under the stated assumptions, the program is correct, and we conclude that the correctness is **True**.
