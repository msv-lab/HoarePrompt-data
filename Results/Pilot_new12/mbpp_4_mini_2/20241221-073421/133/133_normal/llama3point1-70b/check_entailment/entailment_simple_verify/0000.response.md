Final: **True** 

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the subtraction of two tuples element-wise, as outlined in the problem description. The provided annotations confirm that the inputs `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length and contain numeric values before the function call, ensuring that valid operations are performed.

The key points supporting the correctness are:

1. **Correctness of Operation**: The function uses `zip` to pair elements from both tuples and iterates through the pairs, performing subtraction correctly.

2. **Return Type**: The result is returned as a tuple, fulfilling the requirement specified in the problem description.

3. **Handling Tuples of the Same Length**: Since the annotations specify that the tuples have the same length, there is no ambiguity or issue related to differing lengths when the function is called, ensuring that all indices match correctly.

4. **Handling of Valid Numeric Values**: The annotations clarify that the `tup1` and `tup2` contain numeric values, and thus the subtraction operation will yield expected results.

Thus, given the consistent behavior of the program according to the problem description and the supportive annotations throughout the discussion, the correctness of the program stands affirmed.
