Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the input tuples `tup1` and `tup2` are of different lengths. While the `zip` function will stop at the shorter tuple, which prevents an index error, this behavior is unintended and does not align with the problem description, which implies that both tuples must be of the same length. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where either tuple might contain non-numeric values, resulting in undefined behavior.

For example:
- If `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the output would be `(1-4, 2-5)` which equals `(-3, -3)`, while there is a missing third element in `tup2`, and the program does not return an error or warning indicating this inconsistency.
- If `tup1 = (1, 'a', 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`, the program would attempt to subtract a string from a number, resulting in a `TypeError`, which is outside the prediction of the behavior described.

Thus, because it does not meet the requirements of sameness in length and proper numeric handling for every potential case, the program is deemed incorrect.
