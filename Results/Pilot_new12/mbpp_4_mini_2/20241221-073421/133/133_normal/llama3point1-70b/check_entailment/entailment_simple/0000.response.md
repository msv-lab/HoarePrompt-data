Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and subtracts the corresponding elements using their indices. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Tuple Input**: The function accepts two tuples, which is implied in the context that the input will always be valid and of equal length.
2. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The function uses a generator expression inside a `tuple()` to iterate over the elements of the tuples in parallel (using `zip()`). This allows for element-wise subtraction.
3. **Return Type**: The output is a tuple, which aligns with the requirement of returning the differences in the same indexed format as provided in the input tuples.

Since the implementation accurately follows the problem description and handles the operations on the tuples as specified (assuming valid input is always provided), the program is indeed correct.
