Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement: it takes in two tuples and subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple at corresponding indices.

Hereâ€™s how it works:
- The program uses `zip` to iterate over both tuples in parallel, allowing it to access elements from both tuples at the same index simultaneously.
- It employs a generator expression inside the `tuple()` constructor to perform the subtraction `a - b` for each pair of elements.

Consider these examples:
1. `func_1((5, 3, 2), (1, 2, 1))` results in `(4, 1, 1)`.
2. `func_1((10, 20, 30), (1, 2, 3))` results in `(9, 18, 27)`.
3. `func_1((1,), (0,))` results in `(1,)`, which is valid.

The function handles cases where tuples:
- Are of equal length (as required).
- Contain only numerical values.
- Can handle negative numbers and zero correctly.

The code does not include error handling for cases where the tuples are of different lengths, which technically would lead to issues if there is an assumption of equal length tuples. However, since no restrictions about the input lengths were mentioned in the problem statement, it can be assumed that the input will always be valid as per the description. Therefore, there are no potential cases I've identified where this code would not work as expected based on the problem description. 

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description adequately.
