The original assessment states that the correctness of the program is **True**. However, upon reviewing the output hints provided, it is clear that the function `func_1` does not adequately handle cases where the input tuples are of different lengths. Specifically, the output hints mention that if the tuples are of different lengths, the `zip` function will only pair elements until the shortest tuple is exhausted, which could lead to unintended behavior or scenarios not accounted for in the original assessment.

Thus, the original assessment is incorrect. The function does indeed only compute the differences for overlapping elements between two tuples of potentially different lengths but does not raise a `ValueError`. Instead, it simply truncates the output to the length of the shorter input, which may not be what is expected based on the problem description that seems to imply handling of tuples of the same length.

Final: **False**
