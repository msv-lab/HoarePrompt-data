Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are tuples of the same length containing numerical values (integers or floats). It returns a new tuple that contains the differences between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. If `tup1` and `tup2` are not of the same length, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the behavior of the `zip` function. Additionally, if either tuple is empty, the function will return an empty tuple as the output.**
