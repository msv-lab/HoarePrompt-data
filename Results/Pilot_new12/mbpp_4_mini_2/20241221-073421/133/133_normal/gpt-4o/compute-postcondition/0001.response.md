The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length that contain numerical values (either integers or floats). After executing the function body, it returns a tuple consisting of the differences between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of numerical values and return a new tuple that represents the element-wise differences between these two input tuples.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters tup1 and tup2, which are tuples of the same length containing numerical values, and returns a tuple with the differences between the corresponding elements of tup1 and tup2.**
