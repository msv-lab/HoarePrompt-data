Final: **True** 

The original assessment stating that the program is correct is accurate. The implementation of `func_1` adheres closely to the problem description, successfully subtracting elements of the first tuple from corresponding elements in the second tuple. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function produces the expected output for various cases, including both positive and negative results. 

Additionally, the annotations confirm that just before the function executes, the inputs are guaranteed to be tuples of the same length containing numerical values, which aligns with the problem requirements. Thus, based on the checked assertions and the correctness of the logic within `func_1`, the program meets the expectations set forth in the problem description.
