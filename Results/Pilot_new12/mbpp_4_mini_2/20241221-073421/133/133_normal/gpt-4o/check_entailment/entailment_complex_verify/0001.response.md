Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description by accurately subtracting corresponding elements of two tuples of the same length and returning the results as a new tuple. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for various test cases, including those resulting in both positive and negative values.

The annotations confirm that the inputs are tuples of the same length containing numerical values and that the function returns the expected output as described. The function's design using `zip` ensures that pairs of elements are correctly subtracted, and the behavior concerning longer or shorter tuples was also correctly noted in the annotations.

Overall, since the program meets the problem description, the original assessment stands correct, supporting the conclusion that the implementation is accurate. Thus, the final assessment is True.
