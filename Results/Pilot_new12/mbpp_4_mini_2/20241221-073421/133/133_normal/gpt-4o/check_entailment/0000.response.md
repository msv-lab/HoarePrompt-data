Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(tup1, tup2)` correctly subtracts the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The logic uses `zip` to pair elements from both tuples and performs the subtraction element-wise.

Let's analyze the provided assertions:
1. For `func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18))`, the expected result is `(10-2, 4-5, 5-18) = (8, -1, -13)`. This assertion is correct.
2. For `func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16))`, the expected result is `(11-24, 2-45, 3-16) = (-13, -43, -13)`. This assertion is also correct.
3. For `func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12))`, the expected result is `(7-10, 18-11, 9-12) = (-3, 7, -3)`. This assertion is correct as well.

The function works as intended for the tested cases where both tuples have the same length. It does not handle the case where tuples differ in length, which could lead to unexpected behavior. However, the problem description implies element-wise subtraction and does not specify handling for unequal lengths. 

Overall, since no case results in failure and the provided cases work correctly, the code follows the problem description accurately.

Thus, I conclude the correctness of the program.
