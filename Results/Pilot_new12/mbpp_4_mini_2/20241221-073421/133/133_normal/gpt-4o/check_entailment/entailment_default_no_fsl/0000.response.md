Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle cases where the two tuples are of different lengths or where either tuple is empty, even though it mentions that it would raise a `ValueError` in such cases. According to the problem description, the function should work for tuples of the same length and return an empty tuple when both are empty, but if they are of different lengths and the code does not handle this scenario appropriately, it results in incorrect behavior.

For example:
- Input: `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))` would raise a `ValueError` due to differing lengths.
- Input: `func_1((), ())` would return `()` as expected.
- However, as the problem must work for every potential case, the differing lengths case being unhandled leads to the conclusion that it is incorrect. 

Thus, since there are cases where the program fails, the correctness is false.
