Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes in two tuples (`tup1` and `tup2`) and subtracts the corresponding elements of the first tuple from the second one, producing a new tuple of the differences.

1. **Tuple Handling**: The program uses the `zip` function to pair the elements of the two tuples, ensuring that the subtraction occurs for elements at the same index. This is consistent with the problem requirement to subtract elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.

2. **Return Value**: The function returns a new tuple containing the results of those subtractions, which aligns perfectly with the expected output format as described in the problem.

3. **Validation of Length**: The program indirectly assumes that the tuples will always be of the same length (as stated in the function precondition), which is a valid assumption based on the problem description. If they are not, `zip` would handle this by truncating to the shortest tuple, but this case does not need to be considered since the problem description ensures that the inputs will be valid.

4. **Handling of Empty Tuples**: The function also handles the case of empty tuples and will return an empty tuple as a result, which is correct given that subtracting nothing from nothing should yield nothing.

Overall, all these points confirm that the function meets the problem description, successfully computes the difference of corresponding elements from the two tuples, and adheres to the expected behaviors outlined.
