Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality of subtracting the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The provided assertions test various cases, including scenarios where the resulting values are both positive and negative, and the function computes the expected results in each case. 

Additionally, the function uses the `zip` function to pair corresponding elements from both tuples, and then it subtracts them using a generator expression wrapped in the `tuple()` constructor. 

No edge cases or input scenarios suggest that the program would fail. The function correctly handles tuples of the same length as intended by the problem description. Therefore, the implementation is accurate, and no example exists to demonstrate it not working as expected.
