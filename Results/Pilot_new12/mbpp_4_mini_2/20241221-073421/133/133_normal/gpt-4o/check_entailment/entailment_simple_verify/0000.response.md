Final: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly implements the intended behavior as described in the problem statement. The assertions provided in the annotations show that the function properly subtracts elements of two tuples with the same index. The additional context provided in the annotations confirms that the input tuples contain numerical values and have the same length at the point of function execution.

The original assessment accurately reflects this correctness, as the function has been tested with various inputs and consistently produces the expected results. Furthermore, the assumption that the input will be valid (tuples of equal length containing numerical values) aligns with the purpose of the program, and thus any unhandled cases regarding input length are deemed irrelevant under the specified conditions of valid input.

Since all tested cases confirm the function's correctness and the reasoning supports this outcome, I maintain the original assessment as accurate.
