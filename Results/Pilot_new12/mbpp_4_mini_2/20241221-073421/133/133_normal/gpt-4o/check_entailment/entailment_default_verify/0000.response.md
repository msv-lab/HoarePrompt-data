Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the desired behavior of subtracting corresponding elements from two tuples, as defined in the problem description. The analysis of the test cases confirms that the function produces the expected results for the provided inputs. 

The output hints provide valuable insight into the function's behavior, emphasizing that it will work correctly for tuples of the same length and will yield an empty tuple for empty inputs. While the function does not explicitly handle cases where the tuples are of unequal length (it would raise a `ValueError`), the problem description does not specify that this should be addressed, and it's implied that valid input will be provided. 

Thus, the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and aligns with the expected outputs demonstrated in the assertions.
