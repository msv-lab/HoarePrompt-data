Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the task defined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and calculates the differences of their corresponding elements using a generator expression with the `zip` function. This effectively pairs elements from both tuples based on their indices, allowing for direct subtraction.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Type**: The function is given two tuples, which aligns with the requirement that it should take in two tuples.

2. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The function subtracts each element of the first tuple (`tup1`) from the corresponding element of the second tuple (`tup2`) at the same index, as required.

3. **Output Type**: The result of the operation is returned as a new tuple, containing the differences of the corresponding elements, which matches the expected behavior described.

The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests to verify that the function behaves as intended with specified inputs, producing the correct outputs. Therefore, the implementation correctly follows the requirements laid out in the problem description.
