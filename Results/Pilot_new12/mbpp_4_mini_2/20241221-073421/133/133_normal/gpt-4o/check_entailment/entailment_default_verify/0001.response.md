Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` implements the required functionality of subtracting corresponding elements of two tuples, resulting in a new tuple containing these differences. The output hints clarify that if the tuples are of unequal lengths, the function will raise a `ValueError`, and if either tuple is empty, the function will correctly return an empty tuple. 

Since the problem description states that two tuples of the same length are expected, and considering the assumption that proper inputs will be provided, the function behaves correctly under the specified conditions. It accurately handles both positive and negative results from the subtraction as demonstrated by the assertions. Thus, the original assessment of **True** for correctness remains valid.
