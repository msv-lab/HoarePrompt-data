The variable `r` is assigned the value of the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. The outcome will depend on the specific values of `x` and `y`, which are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates. Therefore, `r` will be the distance from the origin (0, 0) to the point (x, y).

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates; `r` is equal to `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2`.**
