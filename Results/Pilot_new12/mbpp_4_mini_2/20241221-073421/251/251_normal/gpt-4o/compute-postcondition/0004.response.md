Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, which represent rectangular coordinates. It calculates and returns their polar coordinates `(r, theta)`, where `r` is the distance from the origin to the point (given by the formula `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`) and `theta` is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (calculated using `atan2(y, x)`). The function does not account for complex numbers or input validation, so if either input is not a real number, it would raise a `TypeError`. However, under the assumption that inputs are valid, the function will correctly convert the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.**
