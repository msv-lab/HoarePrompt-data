The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, it returns the polar coordinates (r, theta), where r is equal to the square root of (x^2 + y^2), and theta is equal to the arctangent of (y/x). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept real numbers `x` and `y` representing rectangular coordinates and return their corresponding polar coordinates (r, theta). 

Functionality: **The function accepts two real numbers x and y representing rectangular coordinates, and returns their polar coordinates (r, theta), where r is the square root of (x^2 + y^2) and theta is the arctangent of (y/x).**
