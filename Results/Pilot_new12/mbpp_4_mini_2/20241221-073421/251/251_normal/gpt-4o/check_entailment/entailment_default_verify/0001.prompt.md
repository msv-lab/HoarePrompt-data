You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(3, 4) == (5.0, 0.9272952180016122)
assert func_1(4, 7) == (8.06225774829855, 1.0516502125483738)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (22.67156809750927, 0.8478169733934057)

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, theta)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1(x, y)` calculates the radius `r` using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is the correct method for determining the magnitude of the vector from the origin to the point (x, y).

2. It calculates the angle `theta` using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which properly handles the angle measurement in all quadrants based on the signs of x and y. This method ensures that the angle is computed correctly and is represented in the range of (-π, π).

3. The assertions provided test the function with multiple valid rectangular coordinates, and the expected results are accurate for the conversion to polar coordinates according to the mathematical definitions.

4. Since all provided test cases return the expected polar coordinates and the function correctly implements the conversion logic, I see no edge cases or potential failures in the conversion process.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, which represent rectangular coordinates. It calculates and returns their polar coordinates `(r, theta)`, where `r` is the distance from the origin to the point (given by the formula `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`) and `theta` is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (calculated using `atan2(y, x)`). The function does not account for complex numbers or input validation, so if either input is not a real number, it would raise a `TypeError`. However, under the assumption that inputs are valid, the function will correctly convert the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
