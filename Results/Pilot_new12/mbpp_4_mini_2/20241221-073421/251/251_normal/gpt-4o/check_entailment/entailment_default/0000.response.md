Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` accurately converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) into polar coordinates (r, theta). It correctly computes `r` using the formula `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)` for the distance from the origin and `theta` using `atan2(y, x)` for the angle. The examples provided (e.g., `func_1(3, 4)`, `func_1(4, 7)`, and `func_1(15, 17)`) yield the correct polar coordinates as expected. Given that the problem assumes valid input, the function performs correctly under these conditions. Thus, there are no edge cases identified that disrupt the specified functionality, leading to the conclusion that the program is correct.
