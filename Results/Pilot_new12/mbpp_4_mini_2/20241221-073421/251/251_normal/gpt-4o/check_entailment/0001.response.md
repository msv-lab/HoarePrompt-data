Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1(x, y)` calculates the radius `r` using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is the correct method for determining the magnitude of the vector from the origin to the point (x, y).

2. It calculates the angle `theta` using the `math.atan2(y, x)` function, which properly handles the angle measurement in all quadrants based on the signs of x and y. This method ensures that the angle is computed correctly and is represented in the range of (-π, π).

3. The assertions provided test the function with multiple valid rectangular coordinates, and the expected results are accurate for the conversion to polar coordinates according to the mathematical definitions.

4. Since all provided test cases return the expected polar coordinates and the function correctly implements the conversion logic, I see no edge cases or potential failures in the conversion process.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
