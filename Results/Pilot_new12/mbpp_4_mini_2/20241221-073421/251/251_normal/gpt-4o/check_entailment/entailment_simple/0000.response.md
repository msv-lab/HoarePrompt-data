Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to convert rectangular coordinates (x, y) into polar coordinates (r, θ). 

Here's how the program satisfies the requirements:

1. **Calculation of r**: The program calculates the radius \( r \) using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is correct for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.

2. **Calculation of θ**: The angle \( \theta \) is calculated using \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \). The use of the `math.atan2` function ensures that the angle is correctly determined based on the signs of x and y, handling all quadrants of the Cartesian plane.

3. **Return Values**: The function returns a tuple of the polar coordinates \( (r, \theta) \), which exactly meets the requirements laid out in the problem description. 

4. **Assertions**: The program includes assertions that check the output against expected values for specific inputs, which further confirms the correctness of the function for those test cases. 

Since the function correctly implements the mathematical conversion from rectangular to polar coordinates for any real number inputs x and y, it adheres to the problem description and thus is deemed correct.
