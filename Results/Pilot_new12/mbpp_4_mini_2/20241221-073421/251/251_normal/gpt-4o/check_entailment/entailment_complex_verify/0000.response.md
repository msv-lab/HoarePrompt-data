Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies a fundamental issue with the program: `func_1` is called before it is defined, resulting in a `NameError` when any assertion is evaluated. Hence, the program cannot execute successfully, regardless of the logic within the function itself. The annotations confirm that the assertions are intended to test the function's behavior but fail to recognize that the function's placement in the code leads to an error when trying to call it. Therefore, the program does not meet the expectations outlined in the problem description because it cannot be executed correctly as is. The assessment is justified and retains its validity.
