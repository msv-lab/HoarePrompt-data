Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program's structure causes a `NameError` because the function `func_1` is referenced in assertions before it is defined in the code. The function should be defined prior to any calls made to it. According to Python's language rules, function definitions must occur before they can be invoked, and the annotations confirm that the function is only defined after the assertions. Consequently, even if the logic within `func_1` is correct, the program will not run successfully due to this structural issue, leading to an overall conclusion that it does not meet the problem description as intended.
