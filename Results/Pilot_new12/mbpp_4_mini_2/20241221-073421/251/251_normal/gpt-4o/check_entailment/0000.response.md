Correctness: **False**.

The implementation of the function is placed after the test assertions. This means that when the assertions are evaluated, the function `func_1` has not yet been defined, leading to a NameError. Specifically, evaluating `func_1(3, 4)` before its definition will raise an error, making the program incorrect regardless of whether the logic in `func_1` is valid or not. 

Hereâ€™s a specific case where it fails: 
- When running the first assertion (i.e., `func_1(3, 4)`), it will result in a `NameError` because `func_1` is not defined at that point in the code. 

Hence, the program does not work as expected for this case.
