Final: **False**

The original assessment of the program being incorrect is valid. The main reason for this assessment is that the function `func_1` is defined after the test assertions. This means that when the assertions are evaluated, `func_1` has not yet been defined, which will result in a `NameError`. Thus, the program will indeed not work as expected, making the overall correctness of the program false regardless of whether the logic within `func_1` for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates is implemented correctly. 

Therefore, the original assessment accurately captures the issue in the program's structure that prevents it from running successfully.
