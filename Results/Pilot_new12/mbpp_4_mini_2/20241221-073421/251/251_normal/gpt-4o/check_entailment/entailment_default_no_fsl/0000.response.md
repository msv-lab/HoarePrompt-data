Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the potential case of non-numeric inputs since it only assumes that valid inputs will be provided. While the current test assertions use valid numeric inputs, if a caller mistakenly provides a value that is not a real number (e.g., a string or a complex number), the program would raise a `TypeError`. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem description for every potential case as specified.
