Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1(x, y)` correctly computes the polar coordinates (r, θ) from the given rectangular coordinates (x, y).

1. The calculation of `r` using `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)` correctly determines the radius from the origin to the point (x, y), complying with the mathematical definition of polar coordinates.

2. The use of `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate `theta` ensures that the angle is determined correctly according to the quadrant in which the point lies, staying within the expected range of (-π, π).

3. The assertions provided validate that the function returns correct results for the specific inputs, confirming the implementation's correctness as defined in the problem description.

4. The annotations clarifying the state of input parameters just before invoking the function further substantiate that the function is designed to handle valid inputs, aligning with the assumption that the input will always be valid.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, and the provided annotations support this verification.
