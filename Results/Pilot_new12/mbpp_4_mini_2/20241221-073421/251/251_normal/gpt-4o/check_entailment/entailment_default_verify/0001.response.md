Final: **True**

The original assessment that the program is correct is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly implements the mathematical formulas needed to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. 

Key points supporting this conclusion are:

1. The calculation for the radius `r` uses the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is indeed the correct method to find the distance from the origin to the point (x, y).

2. The angle `theta` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which takes into account the correct quadrant for the angle based on the signs of both x and y. This ensures accurate angle representation.

3. The assertions provided test the function with specific rectangular coordinates and correctly compare the outputs against expected polar coordinates.

4. Though the hints mention the function does not account for complex numbers or input validation, the problem description assumes valid input is given. Under that assumption, the function will reliably provide the correct conversion.

Overall, since the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and successfully passes the provided test cases, the original assessment is maintained as accurate.
