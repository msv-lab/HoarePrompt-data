Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates as described in the problem statement. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. The input parameters `x` and `y` are defined as real numbers, which correctly represent the rectangular coordinates.

2. The computation of `r` (the radial distance) is done using the formula \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is the correct method to obtain the distance from the origin to the point in rectangular coordinates.

3. The calculation of `theta` (the angle) is performed using `math.atan2(y, x)` which correctly returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (x, y). This function is preferable over `math.atan(y/x)` as it correctly handles different quadrants and cases where x is zero.

4. The function returns a tuple `(r, theta)`, matching the required output format.

5. The assertions provided in the program test the function with different valid inputs, demonstrating that it produces the expected polar coordinates.

Since the function is implemented correctly according to the provided problem description, we conclude that it will always do what is required, given valid inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
