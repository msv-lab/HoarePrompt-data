#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers representing the rectangular coordinates.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, theta
    #The program returns the polar coordinates (r, theta) where r is equal to the square root of (x^2 + y^2) and theta is equal to the arctangent of (y/x)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, which represent rectangular coordinates. It calculates and returns their polar coordinates `(r, theta)`, where `r` is the distance from the origin to the point (given by the formula `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`) and `theta` is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (calculated using `atan2(y, x)`). The function does not account for complex numbers or input validation, so if either input is not a real number, it would raise a `TypeError`. However, under the assumption that inputs are valid, the function will correctly convert the rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
