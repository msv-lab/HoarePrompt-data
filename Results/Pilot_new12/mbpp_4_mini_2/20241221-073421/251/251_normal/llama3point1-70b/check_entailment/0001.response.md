Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†). 

- The variable `r` is calculated using `math.hypot(x, y)`, which computes the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y), effectively giving the radial coordinate in polar form.
- The variable `phi` is computed using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). This correctly accounts for the signs of both x and y to ensure the angle is accurate for all quadrants.

This implementation covers all possible cases:
1. For the origin (0, 0), `r` will be 0, and `phi` will be 0, which is expected in polar coordinates.
2. For positive and negative values of x and y, the function provides valid polar coordinates which accurately represent the angle and distance from the origin.

Since I cannot find a test case where this implementation fails to meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
