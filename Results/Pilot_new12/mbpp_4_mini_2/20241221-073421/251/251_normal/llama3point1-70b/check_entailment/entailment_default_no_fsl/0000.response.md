Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). It uses the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radius r as the distance from the origin (0,0), which is always non-negative and handles the case when both x and y are zero by returning r = 0. The angle φ is calculated using the `math.atan2` function, which properly accounts for the quadrant of the point (x, y) and returns φ in the correct range. 

Additionally, as noted in the output hints, the atan2 function handles the case where both x and y are zero by returning φ = 0, which is the convention. The implementation adheres to the problem description and correctly handles edge cases. Thus, it meets all the requirements outlined.
