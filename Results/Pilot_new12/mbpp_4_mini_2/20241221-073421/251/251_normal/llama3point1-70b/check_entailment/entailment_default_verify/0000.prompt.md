You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, phi)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). 

- It uses the `math.hypot` function to calculate the distance r from the origin, which correctly computes \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).
- It then computes the angle φ using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y), handling various quadrants appropriately.

There are no edge cases or inputs that seem to cause the function to misbehave, as it handles all potential values for x and y correctly, including the origin (0, 0). In this case, r should be 0 and φ is traditionally undefined but often considered 0 by convention. For all other cases, it accurately computes the polar coordinates.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two real numbers, x and y, representing rectangular coordinates. It calculates the polar coordinates (r, phi) where r is the hypotenuse computed using the Euclidean distance formula from (x, y) and is always a non-negative value. Phi is the angle in radians calculated from the coordinates (y, x) using the arctangent function. The function returns the computed values (r, phi). Edge cases considered include instances where x and y are both zero, resulting in r being zero and phi being undefined, which the atan2 function correctly handles by returning zero in this case.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
