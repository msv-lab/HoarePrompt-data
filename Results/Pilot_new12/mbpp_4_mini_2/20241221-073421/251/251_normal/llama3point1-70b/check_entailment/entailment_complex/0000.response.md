Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ) as described in the problem description. 

- The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the distance r (the hypotenuse) from the origin to the point (x, y), which is the correct formulation for converting from rectangular to polar coordinates.
- It uses `math.atan2(y, x)` to compute the angle φ in radians, which correctly accounts for the signs of x and y to determine the correct quadrant of the angle.
- The annotations confirm that both r and φ are correctly derived from the rectangular coordinates and that edge cases, such as both x and y being zero, are handled appropriately according to the mathematical definitions.

Since the function adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential valid inputs, it is indeed correct.
