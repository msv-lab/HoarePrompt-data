Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ) as per the problem description. The original assessment accurately reflects this correctness.

- The function uses `math.hypot` to calculate \( r \), which computes the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y) correctly.
- It utilizes `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate φ, providing the correct angle in radians for all quadrants and appropriately handling the case where both coordinates are zero.

The output hints support this assessment, confirming that the function behaves as intended, including handling the edge case where (x, y) is (0, 0) and returning (0, 0) for the polar coordinates, which is conventionally acceptable.

Overall, all the evidence indicates that the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, and there are no indicated flaws in implementation, confirming the correctness of the original assessment.
