Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, phi) as specified in the problem description. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Rectangular Coordinates to Polar Coordinates Conversion**: 
   - The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radial distance `r` from the origin to the point (x, y). This is correctly computed as \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is the definition of the radius in polar coordinates.
   - The angle `phi` is computed using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y) in radians. This is the correct way to calculate the angle in polar coordinates, taking into account the signs of `x` and `y` to determine the proper quadrant.

2. **Return Values**: The function returns both `r` and `phi` in the correct format, which is required by the problem description.

3. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The problem statement indicates that valid input will be provided, and the function handles it appropriately without any error cases. It doesn't need additional validation or error handling since it's guaranteed that inputs will be correct.

Therefore, the program meets the specifications of the problem description accurately, ensuring that it always performs the required conversion correctly for valid inputs.
