Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). 

- It uses the `math.hypot` function to calculate the distance r from the origin, which correctly computes \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \).
- It then computes the angle φ using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y), handling various quadrants appropriately.

There are no edge cases or inputs that seem to cause the function to misbehave, as it handles all potential values for x and y correctly, including the origin (0, 0). In this case, r should be 0 and φ is traditionally undefined but often considered 0 by convention. For all other cases, it accurately computes the polar coordinates.
