Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ) as described in the problem. 

The use of `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radius \( r \) ensures that the distance is correctly computed as \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is essential for polar coordinates. The use of `math.atan2(y, x)` properly computes the angle φ in radians, taking into account the correct quadrant of the point (x, y).

The annotations confirm that before the function call, x and y are valid real numbers and after execution, the function returns the correct values for r and φ, maintaining the expected behavior. Thus, based on both the program's logic and the provided annotations, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and operates correctly across all specified cases, including the edge case at the origin.
