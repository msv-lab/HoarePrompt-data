The function accepts two real numbers, x and y, representing rectangular coordinates. It calculates the polar coordinates (r, phi) where r is the hypotenuse computed using the Euclidean distance formula from (x, y) and is always a non-negative value. Phi is the angle in radians calculated from the coordinates (y, x) using the arctangent function. The function returns the computed values (r, phi). Edge cases considered include instances where x and y are both zero, resulting in r being zero and phi being undefined, which the atan2 function correctly handles by returning zero in this case.
