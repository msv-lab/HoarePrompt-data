The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, it returns two values: `r`, which is the positive value equal to the hypotenuse of the right triangle formed by the coordinates (using the mathematical function `math.hypot`), and `phi`, which is the angle in radians calculated using `math.atan2` of `y` and `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept real numbers `x` and `y`, and return the hypotenuse `r` and the angle `phi` corresponding to the rectangular coordinates. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y, which are real numbers, and returns r, the hypotenuse computed from (x, y), and phi, the angle in radians computed from (y, x).**
