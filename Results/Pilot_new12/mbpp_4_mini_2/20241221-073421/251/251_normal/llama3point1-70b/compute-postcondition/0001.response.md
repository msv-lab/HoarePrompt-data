The value of `phi` is assigned the result of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which calculates the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y). The value of `r` is already defined as the distance from the origin to the point (x, y), but since `phi` depends solely on `x` and `y`, we do not change `r` during this operation. The output state reflects that `phi` now holds the angle derived from the coordinates (x, y).

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates; `r` is the positive value equal to `math.hypot(x, y)`; `phi` is equal to `math.atan2(y, x)`.**
