The variable `r` is assigned the value of the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y) using the formula `r = math.hypot(x, y)`, which calculates the square root of the sum of the squares of `x` and `y`. Therefore, `r` will equal the positive distance from the origin to the coordinate (x, y). The states of the other variables `x` and `y` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are real numbers representing rectangular coordinates; `r` is the positive value equal to `math.hypot(x, y)` or `sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`.**
