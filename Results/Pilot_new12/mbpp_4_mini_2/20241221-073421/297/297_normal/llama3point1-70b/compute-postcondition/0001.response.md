The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a tuple of at least 2 elements. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the products of each element in `numbers` multiplied by the next element, formed by zipping `numbers` with a shifted version of itself. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of numbers and return a tuple of products of each element with the next one in the sequence. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of numbers and returns a tuple containing the products of each element multiplied by the next element in the sequence.**
