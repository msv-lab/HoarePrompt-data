Correctness: **True**

The program takes a tuple of numbers as input and computes the product of each consecutive pair of elements in the tuple. The implementation uses the `zip` function to pair each element `t_i` with the following element `t_{i+1}` and generates a new tuple of the products.

To verify the correctness:
- For an input tuple with multiple numbers, such as `(1, 2, 3)`, the output would be `(1*2, 2*3)`, which results in `(2, 6)`. This meets the requirement of returning the products of each consecutive pair.
- For a tuple with only one element, such as `(5,)`, the result will be an empty tuple since there are no pairs to multiply, which is also correct.
- For an input with two elements, such as `(4, 7)`, the output will be `(4*7,)`, yielding `(28,)`, which adheres to the specification as well.

Thus, all potential edge cases, such as inputs with different lengths (including length 1, 2, and more), have been considered, and the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. 

Therefore, the implementation is correct for all scenarios described.
