Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. 

The function `func_1` correctly computes the product of each consecutive pair of elements in a tuple, as specified. The annotated code confirms that the input `numbers` is assumed to be a tuple of at least two elements, which aligns with the expectation in the problem description. The use of the `zip` function to pair elements `t_i` with `t_{i+1}` is implemented correctly, generating the desired tuple of products.

The edge cases discussed in the original assessment, such as single-element tuples and tuples with two elements, demonstrate the correctness of the function's behavior for the expected range of input scenarios. The annotation provided reinforces that the expected outcome is indeed a tuple containing products of each element multiplied by the next, which confirms adherence to the specified requirements.

Therefore, the program meets the outlined requirements and behaves as expected.
