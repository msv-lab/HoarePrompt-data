To evaluate the provided Python program against the problem description, let's first restate the requirements clearly:

**Problem description:** Write a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers \( (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) \) and returns a tuple of length \( N \) where the \( i \)-th element of the tuple is equal to \( t_i * t_{i+1} \).

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple((a * b for (a, b) in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])))
```

Now, let's analyze the provided code.

1. The function takes a tuple called `numbers` as the input.
2. It uses the `zip` function to pair each element \( t_i \) with \( t_{i+1} \) from the input tuple. 
3. The `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` effectively creates pairs: \( (t_1, t_2), (t_2, t_3), \ldots, (t_N, t_{N+1}) \).
4. It computes the product for each of these pairs and returns them as a tuple.

Letâ€™s evaluate the behavior of this implementation:

- For an input tuple of length 2, e.g., `(3, 4)`, it should produce the output `(3 * 4,)` which results in `(12,)`. This is correct considering the description.
- For an input tuple of length 3, e.g., `(1, 2, 3)`, it should produce the output `(1 * 2, 2 * 3)` which results in `(2, 6)`. This again matches the requirement.
- For an input tuple of length 4, e.g., `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, it should produce the output `(1 * 2, 2 * 3, 3 * 4)` which results in `(2, 6, 12)` and is correct too.

Now checking edge cases:

- If the input tuple has only one element (e.g., `(5,)`), the output should be empty because there are no valid pairs.
- If the input tuple is empty, it should also return an empty tuple. 

Both cases above should also return an output consistent with the problem statement. The implementation currently handles these cases correctly, as `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` will result in an empty iterator if the input tuple has less than 2 elements, producing an empty tuple as output.

Since all cases from the problem description are satisfied by the program, and every input I've considered works as expected, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly computes the products of adjacent pairs in all valid scenarios including edge cases.
