Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and uses a generator expression with the `zip` function to create a new tuple. Here's a breakdown:

1. The input `numbers` is expected to be a tuple with at least two elements.
2. The line `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` pairs each element in the tuple with the next element (i.e., `t_i` with `t_{i+1}`).
3. The generator expression `a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` computes the product of each pair.
4. Finally, the `tuple(...)` wraps the results in a tuple, producing a final output containing N elements, where each element is the product of successive elements from the input tuple.

Since the function operates exactly as required by the problem description, returning a tuple of length N with values that are the products of the respective elements, the implementation is correct for all valid inputs as specified.
