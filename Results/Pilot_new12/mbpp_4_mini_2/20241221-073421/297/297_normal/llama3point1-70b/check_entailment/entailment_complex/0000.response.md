Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple called `numbers`, which is explicitly stated to contain at least two numerical elements. This aligns with the problem description's requirement that the function takes a tuple of numbers.

2. **Tuple Length**: The problem requires the function to return a tuple of length N, where N is the length of the input tuple minus one (since the function generates products of consecutive elements). The program correctly uses `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its succeeding element, thereby effectively reducing the length of the resulting tuple by one.

3. **Element Calculation**: The expression `a * b` within the tuple comprehension calculates the product of each pair of consecutive elements, meeting the requirement that the i-th element of the output tuple is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program returns a new tuple formed from these products, which is consistent with the requirement to return a tuple.

Since the program adheres strictly to the functional requirements laid out in the problem description and the assumptions made (valid input), it is correct, and thus the output is True.
