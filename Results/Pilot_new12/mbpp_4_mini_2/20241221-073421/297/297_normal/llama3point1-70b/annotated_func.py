#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a tuple of numbers with at least 2 elements.
def func_1(numbers):
    return tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the products of each element in 'numbers' multiplied by the next element, which is formed by zipping 'numbers' with a shifted version of itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of at least two numerical elements, referred to as 'numbers'. It outputs a new tuple where each element is the product of each element in 'numbers' multiplied by the subsequent element. The final state of the program will be a tuple of the products, having a length of one less than the input tuple. The code does not handle the case of input with fewer than two elements since it assumes there will be at least two, as noted in the precondition. Additionally, it does not enforce type checking, so the input elements should ideally be numeric to avoid potential errors in multiplication.
