#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with a length greater than 1.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple of products of consecutive elements in the tuple 't', where each element is the product of t[i] and t[i + 1] for i in the range of the length of 't' minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `t` containing numbers, provided that the length of the tuple is greater than 1. It processes this tuple to generate and return a new tuple, where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple `t`. Specifically, each element of the result is the product of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` for all valid indices `i`. The function does not handle cases where the input tuple is empty or has a length of 1, and thus may raise an error if those conditions are encountered, indicating a limitation in its input validation. The result will have a length of one less than the original tuple `t`.
