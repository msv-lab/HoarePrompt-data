The function accepts a tuple `t` containing numbers, provided that the length of the tuple is greater than 1. It processes this tuple to generate and return a new tuple, where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple `t`. Specifically, each element of the result is the product of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` for all valid indices `i`. The function does not handle cases where the input tuple is empty or has a length of 1, and thus may raise an error if those conditions are encountered, indicating a limitation in its input validation. The result will have a length of one less than the original tuple `t`.
