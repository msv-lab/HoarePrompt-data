The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a tuple of numbers with a length greater than 1. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple of products of consecutive elements in the tuple `t`, where each element is the product of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` for `i` in the range of the length of `t` minus 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `t` and return a tuple containing the products of consecutive elements within the tuple. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple t of numbers with a length greater than 1, and returns a tuple of products of consecutive elements in t.**
