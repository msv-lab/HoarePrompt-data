You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes as input a tuple of numbers (t_1,...,t_{N+1}) and returns a tuple of length N where the i-th element of the tuple is equal to t_i * t_{i+1}.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1((1, 5, 7, 8, 10)) == (5, 35, 56, 80)
assert func_1((2, 4, 5, 6, 7)) == (8, 20, 30, 42)
assert func_1((12, 13, 14, 9, 15)) == (156, 182, 126, 135)
assert func_1((12,)) == ()

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with a length greater than 1.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple of products of consecutive elements in the tuple 't', where each element is the product of t[i] and t[i + 1] for i in the range of the length of 't' minus 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `t` containing numbers, provided that the length of the tuple is greater than 1. It processes this tuple to generate and return a new tuple, where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple `t`. Specifically, each element of the result is the product of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]` for all valid indices `i`. The function does not handle cases where the input tuple is empty or has a length of 1, and thus may raise an error if those conditions are encountered, indicating a limitation in its input validation. The result will have a length of one less than the original tuple `t`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
