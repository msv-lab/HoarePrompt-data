Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to return a tuple of products of consecutive elements of the input tuple. While the code correctly calculates products for tuples with more than one element, it does not handle cases where the tuple has a length of 1 or is empty. The output hints clearly state this limitation, indicating that if the input tuple does not meet the required condition of having more than one element, the function may fail or produce unintended results. 

For instance, if input is an empty tuple `()` or a single-element tuple `(12,)`, the function will not behave as required per the problem description. Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements for all potential input cases, leading to an overall incorrect assessment.

The provided assertions are not sufficient to cover all edge cases, and they confirm that the code does not correctly handle inputs that are invalid or at the lower boundary of valid inputs. Therefore, the function is deemed incorrect.
