To assess the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, we need to examine the implementation of the function `func_1`.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a tuple of numbers and return a new tuple of length N, where the i-th element is equal to the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple.

### Program Review:
Here's the relevant part of the code:
```python
def func_1(t):
    return tuple((t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1)))
```

### Potential Cases to Consider:
1. **Empty Tuple**: If an empty tuple `()` is passed to the function, the expected return should presumably also be an empty tuple, but since the functionality doesn't specify this clearly, we need to check if it handles this case correctly. The code would return `()` since `range(len(()))` would give an empty range.
2. **Single Element Tuple**: As given in the case `assert func_1((12,)) == ()` which is handled correctly by returning an empty tuple.
3. **Multiple Elements**: The code seems to be correctly implemented for tuples with more than one element.

### Verification of Logic:
The implementation uses a generator expression to compute products of consecutive elements which is both concise and clear. Here are extra examples we might check:
- For a tuple with length 2 like `(2, 3)`, it should return `(6,)`.
- For a larger tuple like `(1, 2, 3, 4)` it should return `(2, 6, 12)`.

### Conclusion:
The program appears to handle the specified requirements as it returns tuples of products for valid inputs and returns an empty tuple where required.

Since the function handles the edge cases appropriately and works for inputs of varying sizes as described, I find no scenarios where it fails according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
