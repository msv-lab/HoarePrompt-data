The annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. 

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a tuple `t` as input. According to the problem description, it expects a tuple of numbers, which is properly handled.

2. **Output Requirement**: The output is required to be a tuple of length N where the i-th element is the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements from the input tuple. The program achieves this by:
   - Using a generator expression that iterates over the indices of the tuple up to the second-to-last element (`range(len(t) - 1)`).
   - For each index `i`, it calculates the product `t[i] * t[i + 1]`.
   - The results are then converted into a tuple.

3. **Behavior with Valid Inputs**:
   - For the input `(1, 5, 7, 8, 10)`, the expected output is `(1*5, 5*7, 7*8, 8*10)` which results in `(5, 35, 56, 80)`.
   - For the input `(2, 4, 5, 6, 7)`, the expected output is `(8, 20, 30, 42)`.
   - For the input `(12, 13, 14, 9, 15)`, the expected output is `(156, 182, 126, 135)`.
   - The function also correctly returns an empty tuple `()` when it receives a single element tuple `(12,)`, which aligns with the requirement that it returns a tuple of length N (where N = number of products).

4. **Edge Cases**: The implementation seems aware of edge cases through its iterative boundary. It will directly return an empty tuple for any input tuple that consists of just one element, as no products can be formed.

Overall, the function correctly applies the problem requirements through effective use of indexing and tuple generation based on the given specifications.

Correctness: **True**
