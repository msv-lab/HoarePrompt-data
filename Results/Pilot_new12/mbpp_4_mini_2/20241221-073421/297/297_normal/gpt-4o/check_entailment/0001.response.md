Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when the input tuple has less than two elements correctly. According to the problem description, the function should return a tuple of length N, where N is the length of the input tuple minus one. If the input tuple has only one element, it should return an empty tuple, which the assertions seem to indicate is handled correctly. However, the assertions also include an assertion for a singleton tuple which is misleading because only tuples with at least two elements should be valid inputs for the multiplication operation defined in the problem statement.

Here is the critical case:
- When the input tuple is empty `func_1(())`, it would lead to an error because the function attempts to access elements that do not exist. In this particular case, it should return an empty tuple `( )`, but the function does not handle this situation.

Thus, since the function does not correctly handle all potential inputs (specifically, the empty tuple), it is marked as incorrect.
