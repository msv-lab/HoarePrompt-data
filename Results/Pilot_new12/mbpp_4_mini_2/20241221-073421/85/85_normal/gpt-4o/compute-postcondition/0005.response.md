Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and calculates the difference between the maximum integer and the minimum integer in the list, returning this difference as `max_diff`. If the list is empty, the function would raise a `ValueError` when attempting to find the minimum or maximum, which is a potential edge case not addressed in the annotations. Therefore, the final state of the program after it concludes is that it either returns the maximum difference computed or raises an error if the list is empty.**
