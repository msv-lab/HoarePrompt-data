In the given code, `max_diff` is assigned the value of the difference between `max_val` and `min_val`. The values of `min_val` and `max_val` are based on the list `arr`, where `min_val` is the smallest integer and `max_val` is the largest integer in that list. Therefore, after executing the code, `max_diff` will represent the difference between these two values.

No other variables in the initial state are affected by this calculation. Thus, the Output State reflects the new value of `max_diff`, which is `max_val - min_val`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum integer in `arr`, `max_diff` is equal to `max_val - min_val`.**
