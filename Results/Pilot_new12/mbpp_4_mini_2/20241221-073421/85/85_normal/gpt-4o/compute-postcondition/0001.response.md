The value of `max_val` is assigned the maximum value from the list `arr`. The variable `min_val` remains unchanged, and `arr` retains its list of integers. The output state reflects that `max_val` now holds the maximum integer from `arr`, while `min_val` is still the minimum integer in `arr`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer in `arr`, `max_val` is the maximum integer in `arr`.**
