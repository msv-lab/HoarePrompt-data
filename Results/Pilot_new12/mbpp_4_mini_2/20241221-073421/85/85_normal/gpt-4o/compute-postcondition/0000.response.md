`min_val` is assigned the minimum value from the list `arr`. Since `arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` will hold the smallest integer present in that list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer in `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum integer in `arr`**.
