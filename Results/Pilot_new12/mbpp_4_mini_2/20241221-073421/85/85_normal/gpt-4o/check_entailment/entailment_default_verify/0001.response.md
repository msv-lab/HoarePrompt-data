Final: **False**

The original assessment concluded that the program is correct, focusing on the core functionality of the `func_1` function, which does indeed compute the maximum difference between any two elements in the input array (assuming valid input). However, the output hints reveal an important edge case: the function does not handle the scenario where the input array is empty. In such cases, attempting to find the minimum or maximum would raise a `ValueError`. 

The problem description asks specifically for a function to find the maximum difference, and while the program works well with the provided test cases, it fails to account for potential inputs that could disrupt its operation (i.e., an empty list). Since the correctness assessment should encompass all expected input scenarios, not just the presented ones, the failure to handle this edge case means the program does not fully meet the requirement set by the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
