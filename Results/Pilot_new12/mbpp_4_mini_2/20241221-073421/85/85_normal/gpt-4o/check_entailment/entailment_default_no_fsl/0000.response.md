Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the edge case of an empty input list. If the input array `arr` is empty, the calls to `min(arr)` and `max(arr)` will raise a `ValueError`. This means that for the case of an empty list, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which states that it should find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. Since the function would fail to return a valid output in this scenario, it does not satisfy all potential cases; hence, it is deemed incorrect.
