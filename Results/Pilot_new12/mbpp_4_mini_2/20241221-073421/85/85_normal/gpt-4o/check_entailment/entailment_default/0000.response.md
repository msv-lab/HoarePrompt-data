The program provided in the task correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by finding the minimum and maximum values of the array and returning their difference. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the points:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` uses Python's built-in `min()` and `max()` functions on the input tuple or array `arr`. It computes the maximum difference by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.

2. **Correctness with examples**:
   - For `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, `min` is `1` and `max` is `5`, so the difference is `5 - 1 = 4`, which matches with `assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4`.
   - For `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, `min` is `1` and `max` is `9`, yielding `9 - 1 = 8`, consistent with `assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8`.
   - For `(3, 2, 1)`, `min` is `1` and `max` is `3`, resulting in `3 - 1 = 2`, which aligns with `assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2`.

3. **Edge Cases**: The output hints mention that the function does not handle the case when the list is empty (which would raise a `ValueError`), but since we are assuming valid inputs according to the problem description, we do not consider this as a flaw.

Since every provided example returns the expected output and there are no other inputs specified in the problem description that could cause the algorithm to fail (as we assume valid inputs based on the task requirements), the implementation correctly fulfills the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
