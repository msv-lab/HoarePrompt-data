Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does so by finding the minimum and maximum values in the input array and returning the difference between them. For the given test cases:

1. For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `5`, yielding a difference of `4`.
2. For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `9`, yielding a difference of `8`.
3. For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `3`, yielding a difference of `2`.

All test cases are valid, and the logic properly handles positive numbers and the differences as required by the problem description. There doesn't appear to be any edge cases or scenarios that the program does not account for, assuming the input is always a non-empty tuple or list of numbers. Therefore, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description.
