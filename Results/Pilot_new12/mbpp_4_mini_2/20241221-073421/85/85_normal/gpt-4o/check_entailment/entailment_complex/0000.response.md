Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements set out in the problem description, which is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

Here's the breakdown of the annotated program:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(arr)` takes a list of integers as input.
2. **Finding Minimum and Maximum**: It uses the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to determine the smallest and largest elements in the array, respectively.
3. **Calculating the Difference**: It calculates the maximum difference by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value.
4. **Returning the Result**: The function returns this difference.

The assertions provided in the program check whether the function correctly computes the expected maximum differences for specific test cases:

- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the maximum difference is `5 - 1 = 4`.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the maximum difference is `9 - 1 = 8`.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the maximum difference is `3 - 1 = 2`.

All of these outputs match the expected results based on the problem statement.

Additionally, the final state of the function can lead to a `ValueError` if given an empty list; however, the problem statement allows for assumptions regarding input validity. Thus, we conclude that the function fulfills the requirements of the problem as stated.

As such, the program can be deemed correct and fully functional according to the given specifications.
