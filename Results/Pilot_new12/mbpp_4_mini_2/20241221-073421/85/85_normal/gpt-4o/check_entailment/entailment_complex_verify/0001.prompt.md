You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It does this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then calculating their difference. 

The assertions provided in the code:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `5`, leading to a difference of `4`, which is correctly returned.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `9`, leading to a difference of `8`, which is also correctly returned.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `3`, resulting in a difference of `2`, which is correctly returned as well.

Since all provided test cases return the expected results and no edge cases are evident that would cause the function to fail to meet the requirements of finding the maximum difference, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum integer 'max_val' and the minimum integer 'min_val' in the list 'arr', which is 'max_diff'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and calculates the difference between the maximum integer and the minimum integer in the list, returning this difference as `max_diff`. If the list is empty, the function would raise a `ValueError` when attempting to find the minimum or maximum, which is a potential edge case not addressed in the annotations. Therefore, the final state of the program after it concludes is that it either returns the maximum difference computed or raises an error if the list is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
