Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

The function `func_1(arr)` first computes the minimum and maximum values in the input array `arr` using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions. It then calculates the difference between these two values, which represents the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. The result is returned as `max_diff`.

For example, for the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum value is `1` and the maximum value is `5`, resulting in a maximum difference of `4`. This is consistent with the problem's requirement. 

Additionally, all provided test cases confirm that the function behaves correctly for various inputs, ensuring that it consistently meets the specified criteria of the problem description under the assumption that valid input will always be provided. 

As such, the program accurately fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description, and hence the correctness is confirmed.
