Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It does this by finding the minimum and maximum values in the array and then calculating their difference. 

The assertions provided in the code:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `5`, leading to a difference of `4`, which is correctly returned.
- For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `9`, leading to a difference of `8`, which is also correctly returned.
- For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `3`, resulting in a difference of `2`, which is correctly returned as well.

Since all provided test cases return the expected results and no edge cases are evident that would cause the function to fail to meet the requirements of finding the maximum difference, the program is correct.
