You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
assert func_1((2, 1, 5, 3)) == 4
assert func_1((9, 3, 2, 5, 1)) == 8
assert func_1((3, 2, 1)) == 2

def func_1(arr):
    min_val = min(arr)
    max_val = max(arr)
    max_diff = max_val - min_val
    return max_diff


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does so by finding the minimum and maximum values in the input array and returning the difference between them. For the given test cases:

1. For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `5`, yielding a difference of `4`.
2. For the input `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `9`, yielding a difference of `8`.
3. For the input `(3, 2, 1)`, the minimum is `1` and the maximum is `3`, yielding a difference of `2`.

All test cases are valid, and the logic properly handles positive numbers and the differences as required by the problem description. There doesn't appear to be any edge cases or scenarios that the program does not account for, assuming the input is always a non-empty tuple or list of numbers. Therefore, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and calculates the difference between the maximum integer and the minimum integer in the list, returning this difference as `max_diff`. If the list is empty, the function would raise a `ValueError` when attempting to find the minimum or maximum, which is a potential edge case not addressed in the annotations. Therefore, the final state of the program after it concludes is that it either returns the maximum difference computed or raises an error if the list is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
