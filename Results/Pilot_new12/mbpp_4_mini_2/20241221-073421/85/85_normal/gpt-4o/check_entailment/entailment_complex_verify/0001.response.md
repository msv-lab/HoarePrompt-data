Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` accurately calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given list of integers. The program utilizes the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions to compute the minimum and maximum values in the array and subsequently returns their difference, `max_diff`.

The assertions provided in the code confirm this behavior with valid test cases:
- For the input `(2, 1, 5, 3)`, the output is indeed `4`.
- For `(9, 3, 2, 5, 1)`, the output is `8`.
- For `(3, 2, 1)`, the output is `2`.

The annotations explain the functioning of the program, reinforcing that the objective is to find `max_val - min_val`.

While the annotation points out a potential issue regarding handling an empty list, the problem description assumes valid input, and thus this concern does not detract from the correctness of the logic implemented in `func_1`. Given the adherence to the problem requirements and the successful passing of the test cases, I maintain that the program is correct.

Therefore, the final assessment remains consistent with the original evaluation, concluding that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
