Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. 

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1(arr)` takes an array `arr` as input.
2. It utilizes the built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value in `arr` and `min()` function to find the minimum value.
3. The difference between these two values (`max(arr) - min(arr)`) will always provide the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

The function handles the following potential cases effectively:

- If the array has multiple elements, it will return the correct maximum difference.
- If the array contains repeated elements, the function will still work correctly since the minimum and maximum would still be derived from the actual distinct values.
- If the array has both negative and positive numbers, the calculation will still be accurate since Python handles the subtraction correctly.

Moreover, if the input array is empty or has only one element, the function would raise a `ValueError`, which should be considered an edge case. However, without specific instructions in the problem description regarding behavior with empty arrays, it could be deemed acceptable as per typical Python behavior.

Since there is no identified case where the function fails to fulfill the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
