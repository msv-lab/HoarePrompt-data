Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers `arr` as input and calculates the maximum difference between any two elements by returning the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. 

Let's break down the reasoning:

- The problem description asks for finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The maximum difference between any two elements can be effectively determined by finding the maximum and minimum values in the arrayâ€”since the difference between these two numbers will yield the highest possible difference.
  
- The program uses `max(arr)` to find the largest number and `min(arr)` to find the smallest number in the list. By subtracting these two values, it directly computes the maximum difference.

- The program assumes that the input list `arr` is non-empty, which means that we won't encounter any errors related to empty lists. This assumption is acceptable as per the guidelines provided, which state that the program is expected to work under the presumption of valid input.

In conclusion, the function meets all requirements laid out in the problem description: it inputs a list of integers and calculates the correct maximum difference. Hence, the correctness of the program is validated as true.
