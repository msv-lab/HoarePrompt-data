You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation given.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
```

### Analysis:

1. The goal is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. In other words, we want to find the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array.
2. The implementation uses `max(arr)` to find the maximum element and `min(arr)` to find the minimum element, then calculates the difference between them.

### Considerations:
- **Empty List:** What if the provided array is empty? The functions `max()` and `min()` will raise a `ValueError` if called on an empty list.
- **Single Element List:** If the array has only one element, the maximum difference would logically be 0 (since the element minus itself is 0), but the current implementation will still return that single element for max and min, and will give a 0 difference.

### Conclusion:
Given these considerations, the implementation fails to handle the edge case of an empty array and may not provide the expected result for a single-element array either.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the integers in the list. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the behavior of the `max()` and `min()` functions. Therefore, the function assumes that `arr` is a non-empty list of integers for successful execution.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
