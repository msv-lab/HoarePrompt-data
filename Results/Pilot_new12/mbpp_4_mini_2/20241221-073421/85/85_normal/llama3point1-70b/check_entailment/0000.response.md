To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the implementation given.

**Problem description:** Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
```

### Analysis:

1. The goal is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in the array. In other words, we want to find the difference between the largest and smallest elements in the array.
2. The implementation uses `max(arr)` to find the maximum element and `min(arr)` to find the minimum element, then calculates the difference between them.

### Considerations:
- **Empty List:** What if the provided array is empty? The functions `max()` and `min()` will raise a `ValueError` if called on an empty list.
- **Single Element List:** If the array has only one element, the maximum difference would logically be 0 (since the element minus itself is 0), but the current implementation will still return that single element for max and min, and will give a 0 difference.

### Conclusion:
Given these considerations, the implementation fails to handle the edge case of an empty array and may not provide the expected result for a single-element array either.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
