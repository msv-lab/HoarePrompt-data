You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum value from the maximum value. 

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1(arr)` takes an array `arr` as input.
2. It utilizes the built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value in `arr` and `min()` function to find the minimum value.
3. The difference between these two values (`max(arr) - min(arr)`) will always provide the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

The function handles the following potential cases effectively:

- If the array has multiple elements, it will return the correct maximum difference.
- If the array contains repeated elements, the function will still work correctly since the minimum and maximum would still be derived from the actual distinct values.
- If the array has both negative and positive numbers, the calculation will still be accurate since Python handles the subtraction correctly.

Moreover, if the input array is empty or has only one element, the function would raise a `ValueError`, which should be considered an edge case. However, without specific instructions in the problem description regarding behavior with empty arrays, it could be deemed acceptable as per typical Python behavior.

Since there is no identified case where the function fails to fulfill the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the integers in the list. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the behavior of the `max()` and `min()` functions. Therefore, the function assumes that `arr` is a non-empty list of integers for successful execution.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
