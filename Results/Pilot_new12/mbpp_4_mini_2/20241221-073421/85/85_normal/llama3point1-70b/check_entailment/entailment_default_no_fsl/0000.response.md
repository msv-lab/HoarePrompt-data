Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case of an empty list, which would raise a `ValueError` when attempting to compute the maximum and minimum values. According to the problem description, it should be able to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a list, but if the input list is empty, it cannot do so, making the function incorrect for that potential case. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement for every potential case.
