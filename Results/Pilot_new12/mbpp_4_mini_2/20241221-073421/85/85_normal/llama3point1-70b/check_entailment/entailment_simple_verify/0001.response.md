Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program meets the problem description of finding the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function `func_1(arr)` correctly calculates this difference by utilizing the `max()` and `min()` functions on the input list of integers. 

The annotations provide clear validation that `arr` is a list of integers. The calculation of the maximum difference as `max(arr) - min(arr)` will reliably yield the expected result for valid input. The assessment also acknowledged the handling of specific cases, such as multiple elements and lists containing both negative and positive numbers. 

Given that valid input is assumed and no errors are expected under those conditions, the program functions correctly as required by the problem description.
