Explanation: The given code seems correct as it accurately follows the problem description, which requires finding the maximum difference between any two elements in the provided array. The logic implemented in the `func_1` function correctly calculates this difference by utilizing the `max()` and `min()` functions on the list, which provide the largest and smallest values, respectively. However, the output hints reveal that if the list `arr` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`. Because the problem description does not explicitly exclude the possibility of an empty list and expects the function to handle it for all potential cases, this constitutes an incorrect implementation.

Correctness: **False**.
