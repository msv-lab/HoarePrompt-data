Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement from the problem description, which is to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. 

The function `func_1(arr)` achieves this by using `max(arr)` to find the maximum value in the array and `min(arr)` to find the minimum value. The difference between these two values, `max(arr) - min(arr)`, essentially gives the maximum difference between any two elements in the list. 

Since the function properly calculates the maximum difference based on the provided definition, and the problem description specifies the requirements accurately, the function satisfies the conditions set forth in the problem description. 

Thus, the program is correct and fulfills the problem requirements.
