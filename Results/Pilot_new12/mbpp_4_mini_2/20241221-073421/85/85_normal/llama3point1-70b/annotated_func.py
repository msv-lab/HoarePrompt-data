#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list of integers 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the integers in the list. If the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` due to the behavior of the `max()` and `min()` functions. Therefore, the function assumes that `arr` is a non-empty list of integers for successful execution.
