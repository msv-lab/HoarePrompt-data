Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(a, b)` takes in two numbers, `a` and `b`, and correctly returns a tuple containing `b` first followed by `a`, which satisfies the problem description requirements. It handles all potential cases since it simply returns the inputs in a swapped order. There are no edge cases that would cause this function to fail; it works correctly for all numeric inputs, including integers, floats, and even negative values. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description.
