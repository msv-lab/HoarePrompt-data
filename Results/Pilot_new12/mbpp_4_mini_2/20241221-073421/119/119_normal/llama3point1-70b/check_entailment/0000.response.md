Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number first and then the first number second, which is precisely what the problem description requires. The function will work correctly for any two numeric inputs, regardless of their types (integers or floats), and will always return a tuple in the specified order. Since the implementation aligns with the given problem description without any edge cases or logical flaws, the correctness is confirmed.
