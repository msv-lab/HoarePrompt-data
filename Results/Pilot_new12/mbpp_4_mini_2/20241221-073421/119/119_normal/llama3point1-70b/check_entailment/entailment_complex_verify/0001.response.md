Final: **True**

The original assessment states that the function correctly returns a tuple with the second number first and the first number second. This matches the problem description and the behavior of the function. The annotations confirm that the function simply returns the provided inputs in swapped order without any constraints, and that it works correctly for various input types, as expected. As there are no indicated errors or edge cases that would affect its correctness for valid inputs, the original assessment of correctness remains accurate.
