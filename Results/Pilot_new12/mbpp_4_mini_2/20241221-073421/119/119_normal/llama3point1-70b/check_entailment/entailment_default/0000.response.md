Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` accurately fulfills the requirements stated in the problem description. It takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns them as a tuple in the order of `(b, a)`. The output hints confirm that the function accepts input of various types without any specified constraints and returns the inputs in reverse order. Since there are no edge cases that disrupt this straightforward tuple formation, the code correctly implements the desired functionality for all potential valid cases in accordance with the problem description. Therefore, the program is indeed correct.
