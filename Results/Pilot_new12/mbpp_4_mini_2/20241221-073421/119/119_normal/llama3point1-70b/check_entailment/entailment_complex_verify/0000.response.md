Final: **True**

The original assessment's correctness is accurate. The program `func_1(a, b)` correctly takes two inputs, `a` and `b`, and returns them in the tuple format as specified in the problem description, with `b` first and `a` second. The annotated version confirms the structure and functionality of the function, clearly stating that it reflects the inputs in reversed order. There are no contradictions between the problem description, the program's behavior, and the annotations provided. Therefore, the program fulfills the requirements as described, confirming its correctness.
