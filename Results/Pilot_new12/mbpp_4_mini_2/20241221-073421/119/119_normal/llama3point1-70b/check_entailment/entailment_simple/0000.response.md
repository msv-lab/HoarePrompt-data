Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing the second number `b` followed by the first number `a` in that exact order (`(b, a)`). 

This matches the problem statement, which specifies that the function should return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The implementation correctly reflects this by swapping the order of the inputs in the returned tuple.

Since the function will consistently output the second argument first followed by the first argument for any valid inputs, it meets the requirements of the problem description under the assumption of valid input types. Thus, the program is correct.
