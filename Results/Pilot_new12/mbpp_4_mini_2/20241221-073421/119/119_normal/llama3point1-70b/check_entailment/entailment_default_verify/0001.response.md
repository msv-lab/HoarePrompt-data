Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description: it takes two numbers as inputs and returns a tuple containing these numbers in swapped order (the second number followed by the first). The output hints confirm that the function does not impose constraints on the types of inputs and effectively handles various types without errors. The function's straightforward logic meets the problem requirements, and there are no errors or unexpected behaviors based on the input assumptions stated, justifying the final conclusion of correctness.
