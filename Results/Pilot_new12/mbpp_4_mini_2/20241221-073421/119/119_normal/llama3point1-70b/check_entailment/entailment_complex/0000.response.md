Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two input parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second number (`b`) first, followed by the first number (`a`). This behavior is explicitly stated in both the annotations and the problem description. Additionally, the function does not enforce any type constraints on the inputs, allowing it to accommodate various typesâ€”consistent with the problem description that implies any number types are acceptable.

The function's correctness can be confirmed as follows:
- When called with any two values (numbers or otherwise), it will always return `(b, a)`, which corresponds to outputting the second input followed by the first input, thus fulfilling the requirement set forth in the problem description.
- Since it assumes valid input, there are no cases where it would fail to meet the description provided the inputs are given correctly.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement.
