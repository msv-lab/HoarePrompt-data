Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description, which is to return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The function `func_1` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and it returns them in the order `(b, a)`. 

The output hints clarify that the function accepts two parameters and returns them in reverse order without any constraints on their types. Since it is specified that valid input will be provided and the function performs its intended task without any errors or exceptions, it meets the correctness criteria for all potential cases, as per the assumption outlined in the problem description. Therefore, every valid input (including various types of numbers or even other data types) will lead to a valid output, fulfilling the requirement.

Overall, since there are no edge cases that the function fails to handle based on the assumptions made, the code is correct.
