Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided output hints. The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly implements the task of taking two numbers and returning a tuple with the values in the specified order: the second number first, followed by the first number. The assessment also correctly notes that there are no constraints on the types of inputs, and that the function will work for any valid numeric inputs, as specified in the problem description. Thus, no edge cases or logical flaws exist that would alter the straightforward nature of the implementation. The program meets the requirements effectively, supporting the conclusion that its correctness is indeed true.
