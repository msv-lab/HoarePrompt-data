#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are any values (of any type).
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a in that order, reflecting their current states.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, a and b, and returns a tuple containing the values of b and a in that order. The function does not exhibit any constraints on the types of a and b, meaning it can handle inputs of various types. After execution, the final state of the program reflects that the original inputs are returned in the reverse order. There are no edge cases handled in the function as it straightforwardly returns the provided arguments without error handling or type checking.
