Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which can be any two numbers (including potentially negative numbers, zero, or large values). It returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that specific reversed order. There are no additional checks or constraints on the values of `a` and `b`, meaning all numerical inputs are valid, including edge cases like both being zero or both being negative. The function performs no other actions and does not modify the input parameters.**
