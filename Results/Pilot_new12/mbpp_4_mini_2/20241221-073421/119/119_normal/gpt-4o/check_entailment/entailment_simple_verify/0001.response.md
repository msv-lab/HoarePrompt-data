Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and correctly returns a tuple containing the values of `b` followed by `a`, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. 

The assertions provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for the supplied test cases, returning the correct tuples. The annotations indicate the state of the program before the function call and clearly state that the values are returned in reverse order, which is consistent with the intended functionality.

Therefore, since the function implementation is correct, the original assessment of **True** remains valid based on the evidence from the program, its assertions, and the provided annotations.
