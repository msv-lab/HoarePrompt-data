The program correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with `b` first and `a` second. The output hints confirm that the function does exactly this without any conditions or additional constraints on the input values, which align with the problem description. 

The code has been verified against the provided assertions (test cases) and handles valid inputs, including potential edge cases such as zero or negative numbers, accurately producing the expected outputs as specified.

Correctness: **True**.
