Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the specified functionality of taking two numbers and returning them in a tuple with the second number first and then the first number. 

Analyzing the provided assertions:
- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which is correct.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which is correct.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, which is correct.

Additionally, the function is simple and operates correctly for any input pair of numbers, fulfilling the requirement without any edge cases missing to handle. Therefore, the implementation meets all criteria laid out in the problem description.
