Correctness: **True**  

The program correctly implements the described functionality. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second number, `b`, followed by the first number, `a`. 

The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function behaves as expected for these example cases:
- For `func_1(10, 20)`, it returns `(20, 10)`.
- For `func_1(15, 17)`, it returns `(17, 15)`.
- For `func_1(100, 200)`, it returns `(200, 100)`.

Since the function works correctly for various inputs, including positive integers, and the code logic aligns with the problem description, there are no edge cases or missing logic to indicate incorrectness. Therefore, the function is robust and operates correctly for all potential inputs.
