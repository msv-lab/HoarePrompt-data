Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. The `func_1` function takes two input numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns them as a tuple in the order of `(b, a)`. This meets the specification of returning a tuple with the second number followed by the first number.

The provided assertions validate the function's correctness by testing with different pairs of numbers. Each assertion checks that the function returns the second number first and then the first number, consistent with the requirement.

Since the program is designed to always return the values in the specified order regardless of which valid numbers are inputs, it adheres to the problem's requirements in all potential cases. Thus, the implementation is correct.
