Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(a, b)` correctly takes in two parameters `a` and `b` and returns a tuple in the order of `(b, a)`. Based on the output hints and the examples provided, the function handles all potential cases, including negative numbers, zero, and large values of `a` and `b`, without any constraints on their values. There are no edge cases indicated by the output hints that the code would fail to handle. Each assertion confirms the expected behavior, thus confirming that the function meets the problem requirements for all valid input scenarios.
