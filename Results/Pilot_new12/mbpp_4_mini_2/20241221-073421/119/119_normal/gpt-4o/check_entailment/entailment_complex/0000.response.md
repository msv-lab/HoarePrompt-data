Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The `func_1` function takes two numbers, `a` and `b`, as inputs and returns them in a tuple in reversed order, specifically `(b, a)`. 

The assertions demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for different pairs of inputs:
- `func_1(10, 20)` correctly returns `(20, 10)`.
- `func_1(15, 17)` correctly returns `(17, 15)`.
- `func_1(100, 200)` correctly returns `(200, 100)`.

These tests confirm that for any two input numbers, the function will always return a tuple containing the second number first, followed by the first number, which aligns perfectly with the problem description's requirements. 

There are no restrictions on the inputs beyond being two numbers, and the function performs as expected across a range of typical cases, including edge cases where the numbers could be negative or zero. Thus, the function is correctly implemented as per the given problem description.
