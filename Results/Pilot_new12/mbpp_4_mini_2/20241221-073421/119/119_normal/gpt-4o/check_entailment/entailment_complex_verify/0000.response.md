Final: **True**

The program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which specifies that the function should take two numbers and return a tuple with the second number first, followed by the first number. The annotated code further reinforces this by clearly stating that the function returns the values in reverse order. Additionally, the assertions provided confirm the expected output for various inputs, demonstrating that the function behaves as intended. The original assessment is supported by the annotations, which affirm that all input cases have been handled properly, fulfilling the criteria outlined in the problem description without missing any edge cases. Thus, the assessment of correctness remains accurate.
