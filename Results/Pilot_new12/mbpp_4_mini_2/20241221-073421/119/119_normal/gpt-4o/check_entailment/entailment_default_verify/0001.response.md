Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program implements the functionality described in the problem statement by defining a function `func_1` that accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, and correctly returns a tuple with `b` first and `a` second. The assertions provided in the code validate that the function works correctly for various representative inputs, confirming its reliability.

The output hints reinforce the correctness of the program by stating that the function can accept any two numbers, including negative numbers and zero. Since the program lacks additional checks and assumes valid inputs, it aligns with the problem description as there are no constraints that it violates. Thus, the function robustly meets the requirements as specified in the problem description.
