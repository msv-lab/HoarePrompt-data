Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly states that the program is functioning as intended based on the problem description. The annotated version of the code reinforces this by showing that the function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, and correctly returns them in the specified order: the second number first and then the first number. 

The assertions confirm that the function behaves correctly for the provided test cases. Each assertion checks if the function output matches the expected tuple format, and all assertions pass without any issues. Furthermore, the annotations clarify the purpose of the function, demonstrating that it effectively handles any pair of numbers.

Thus, the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description, and the original assessment is supported by both the assertions and the annotations.
