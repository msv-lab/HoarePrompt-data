You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(10, 20) == (20, 10)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (17, 15)
assert func_1(100, 200) == (200, 100)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are any two numbers.
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    #The program returns the values of b and a in reverse order, where a and b are any two numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which can be any two numbers (including potentially negative numbers, zero, or large values). It returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that specific reversed order. There are no additional checks or constraints on the values of `a` and `b`, meaning all numerical inputs are valid, including edge cases like both being zero or both being negative. The function performs no other actions and does not modify the input parameters.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
