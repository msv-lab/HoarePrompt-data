Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the program meets the problem description effectively. The function `func_1` takes two parameters and correctly returns them in a tuple with the second number first and the first number second. The output hints confirm that the function does not impose constraints on the input values, and it processes any numerical input correctly, including potential edge cases.

The assertions provided also validate this functionality:
- `func_1(10, 20)` correctly returns `(20, 10)`.
- `func_1(15, 17)` correctly returns `(17, 15)`.
- `func_1(100, 200)` correctly returns `(200, 100)`.

Given that the function performs as described and fulfills the requirements without errors, the assessment of correctness as **True** is supported by both the program's behavior and the output hints.
