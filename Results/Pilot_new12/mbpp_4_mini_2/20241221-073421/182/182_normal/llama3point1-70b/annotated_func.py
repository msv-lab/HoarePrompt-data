#State of the program right berfore the function call: strings is a tuple of strings.
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] for s in strings]
    #The program returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple 'strings'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `strings`, which is expected to be a tuple of strings. It processes each string in the tuple and returns a list containing the last character of each string. If any string in the tuple is empty, attempting to access the last character will result in an `IndexError`. The function does not handle this potential edge case or provide any error checking or default values, so it assumes all strings are non-empty.
