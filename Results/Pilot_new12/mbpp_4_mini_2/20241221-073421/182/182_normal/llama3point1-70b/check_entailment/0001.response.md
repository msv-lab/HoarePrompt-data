Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the task of extracting the last character (rear index element) from each string in a given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates through each string `s` in the tuple `strings` and retrieves the last character using `s[-1]`. 

This implementation works correctly for:
1. Tuples containing non-empty strings (e.g., `("hello", "world")` would output `['o', 'd']`).
2. If the tuple contains a mix of string lengths, it still retrieves the last character for each (e.g., `("a", "bc", "def")` would output `['a', 'c', 'f']`).

However, it does not handle cases where one or more strings in the tuple may be empty. For instance, if the input tuple is `("", "abc")`, the code attempts to access the last character of the empty string, which will raise an `IndexError`.

Since the program does not account for empty strings leading to potential errors, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**

A failing case is `("", "abc")`, where the program would raise an IndexError instead of processing the input correctly.
