Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly extracts the last character (rear index element) of each string in the given tuple. It uses list comprehension to iterate through each string `s` in the input tuple `strings`, and retrieves `s[-1]`, which is the last character of the string. 

Since the program operates on the assumption that the input is a tuple of strings, it correctly handles typical cases like empty strings, single-character strings, and strings of varying lengths. The program does not raise any exceptions for such strings as it is valid to access the last element of a string (even if it's empty). 

The only case where the program may not work as expected is if `strings` contains elements that are not strings (like integers or other data types), which the problem description does not clarify. However, assuming the input is strictly a tuple of strings, it functions correctly. Thus, based on the given problem description, it meets the requirements consistently.
