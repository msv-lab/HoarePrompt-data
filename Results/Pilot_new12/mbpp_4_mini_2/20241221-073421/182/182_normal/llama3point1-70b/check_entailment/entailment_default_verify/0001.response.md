Final: **False**

The original assessment concluded that the program was correct, but it failed to account for the critical edge case of empty strings within the tuple. The program correctly extracts the last character from non-empty strings but raises an `IndexError` when encountering an empty string. Given the problem description states that the function should extract the rear index element of each string, it is essential that the function can handle all cases, including empty strings. Thus, the program does not fully meet the problem requirements and should be deemed incorrect. The output hints further confirm the lack of error handling for empty strings, reinforcing the conclusion that the program is not correct as originally assessed.
