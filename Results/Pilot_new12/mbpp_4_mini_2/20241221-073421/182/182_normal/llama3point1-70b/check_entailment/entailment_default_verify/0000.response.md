Final: **False**

The original assessment claims that the program correctly handles all strings, including empty strings. However, the output hints clearly state that if any string in the tuple is empty, attempting to access the last character will result in an `IndexError`. This means that the program does not handle the edge case of empty strings, contrary to the assessment's assertion that it operates correctly on all types of input, including empty strings. Therefore, since the function can raise an error in the case of empty strings, it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description as intended, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
