Final: **False**

The original assessment was marked as correct, but upon further review, the program does not adequately handle scenarios where the input strings may be empty. The annotations clearly state that if any string in the tuple is empty, attempting to access the last character will raise an `IndexError`, confirming a flaw in the implementation. Although the initial assessment believed the implementation to be fully correct, the reality is that it does not account for all potential input variations as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the assessment should be deemed incorrect.
