The program is supposed to extract the last character from each string in a given tuple. The implementation uses a list comprehension to achieve this, extracting the last character with `s[-1]`. 

However, the output hints indicate that if any string in the tuple is empty, the program will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the last character of an empty string. This raises an issue since the function does not handle the case of empty strings, which could lead to a runtime error.

Thus, there is a potential edge case where if any string in the tuple is empty, the function does not work correctly and leads to an exception.

Correctness: **False**.
