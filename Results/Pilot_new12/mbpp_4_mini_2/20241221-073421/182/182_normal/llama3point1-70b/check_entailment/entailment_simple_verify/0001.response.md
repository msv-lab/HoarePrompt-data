Final: **False** 

The original assessment claimed that the program is correct, which does not consider the potential for an `IndexError` when processing empty strings within the tuple. Although the annotated code accurately describes the behavior of the program, it does not address the fact that the program will fail when encountering an empty string. Therefore, the original assertion that the program is correct is misleading. The program does not handle all cases as described in the problem statement, particularly when the input includes empty strings, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
