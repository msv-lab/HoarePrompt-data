Based on the provided problem description, the program `func_1` is intended to extract the last character of each string in a tuple. The original assessment determined that the program's correctness is **True**, which was supported by the reasoning that the program correctly retrieves the last character using list comprehension and does not raise exceptions for typical cases, assuming valid input.

Upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, the first annotation states that "strings is a tuple of strings," which aligns with the assumption in the original assessment. The function retrieves the last character of each string, and it is accurately described that if any string is empty, it would result in an `IndexError`. This presents a critical edge case that was not addressed previously.

Despite the fact that the original assessment concluded the program was correct, the annotation highlights that the function does not handle the case of empty strings, which could lead to runtime failure if encountered. Since the problem description does not specify that the input will always be non-empty strings, we cannot assume this to always hold true. 

Given that a potential for an `IndexError` exists if an empty string is present in the input tuple, this establishes a condition where the program may not perform as expected under all scenarios, contrary to the implications of the original assessment.

Based on this analysis, the conclusion about the program's correctness needs to be adjusted in light of the potential error case that was highlighted in the annotations.

Final: **False**
