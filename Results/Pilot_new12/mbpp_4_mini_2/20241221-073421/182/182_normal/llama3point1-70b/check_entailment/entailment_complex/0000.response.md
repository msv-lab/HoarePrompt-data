Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description. While it is clear that the function `func_1` aims to extract the last character from each string in the given tuple `strings`, the comments mention that if any string is empty, accessing the last character will result in an `IndexError`. The problem description requires extracting the last character, but it does not account for the scenario where the strings might be empty.

Given the assumption that valid input will be provided, the function implementation does return a list of the last characters of all strings in the tuple. However, this leads to a potential failure case where an empty string could cause the function to throw an error instead of producing a well-defined output, violating the robustness one might expect in a complete solution.

Thus, due to this potential scenario, the function cannot be deemed correct according to the strict requirements of the problem description. If an empty string is included in the tuple, the function would raise an error instead of handling the scenario gracefully.
