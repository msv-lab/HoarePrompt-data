Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Specifically, it defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of strings as input. The program uses a list comprehension to iterate through each string in the tuple and extracts the last character from each string using the index `-1`. 

This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirement to "extract only the rear index element of each string." The function returns a list containing these extracted last characters, which is exactly what is specified in the problem description. 

Since the input is assumed to be valid (a tuple of strings), the function will always perform as expected without raising any errors. Therefore, the implementation meets the specifications set out in the problem description.
