Correctness: **False**

The code is meant to extract the last character of each string in a given tuple. However, as per the output hints, if any string in the tuple is empty, attempting to access the last character results in an `IndexError`. This is a critical edge case that the current implementation does not handle. For example, if the input is `("", "abc")`, the function would raise an error instead of gracefully handling it.

Since the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, it is deemed incorrect.
