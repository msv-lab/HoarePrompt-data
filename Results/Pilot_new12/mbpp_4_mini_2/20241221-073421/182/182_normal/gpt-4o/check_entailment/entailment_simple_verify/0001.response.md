Final: **True**

The program meets the problem description that requires extracting the last character of each string in the given tuple. The annotations confirm that before the function call, the variable `tup` is indeed a tuple of strings and the function `func_1` correctly uses a list comprehension to return the last character of each string in that tuple. 

The original assessment is accurate as it states that the function correctly extracts the last characters from the strings, and the assertions provided successfully test the function against different scenarios, yielding the expected outputs. The annotations reinforce this by clearly indicating the state of the program right before the function call and what the function does. 

Furthermore, the program's behavior with various valid inputs aligns perfectly with the problem description. Hence, the conclusion that the function is correct remains valid.
