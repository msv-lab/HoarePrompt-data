To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations, we can consider all the information:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to extract the last index element of each string in a given tuple. 

2. **Program Implementation**: The function `func_1` follows the requirement by utilizing a list comprehension that accesses the last character of each string with `s[-1]`.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided test the function against various cases, all of which return the expected outputs, indicating that the function behaves as intended for these specific test cases.

4. **Annotations**: The annotated version clarifies that the function is designed to handle tuples containing strings and outlines the behavior in case of empty strings. Specifically, it highlights that an `IndexError` will be raised if any string is empty, which presents a limitation of the implementation. This aspect is crucial as it diverges from the expectation that the function can handle all possible valid tuples of strings without raising exceptions.

5. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment stated correctness as **True**, assuming that the function accurately returns the last character for valid inputs. However, it does not address the potential `IndexError` when encountering an empty string, which makes the function's behavior inconsistent with a broader interpretation of handling valid inputs.

Given the annotations and the limitations described, the program runs correctly under certain conditions but fails to account for edge cases (i.e., empty strings). 

Thus, while the function works under the initial assumptions about valid inputs, the reality of its potential failure in practical use cases (due to `IndexError`) indicates that it does not meet the robustness expected from the problem description.

Final: **False**
