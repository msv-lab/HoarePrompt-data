Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` accurately meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the explanation:

1. **Input**: The function takes a tuple of strings as input, which is exactly what is described in the problem statement.
2. **Output**: It returns a list containing the last character of each string from the input tuple.
3. **Logic**: The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` correctly retrieves the last character (rear index element) from each string `s` in the tuple `tup`.
4. **Examples**: The provided assertions demonstrate that the function correctly returns the expected last characters:
   - For the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, the output is `['s', 'r', 's']`, which is correct.
   - For the input `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, the output is `['e', 'r', 'e']`, which is also correct.
   - For the input `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, the output is `['a', 't', 'o']`, confirming the correctness once more.

Since the function adheres to the specified behavior of extracting the last character from each string in the tuple, it fulfills the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the assertion that the program is correct is valid.
