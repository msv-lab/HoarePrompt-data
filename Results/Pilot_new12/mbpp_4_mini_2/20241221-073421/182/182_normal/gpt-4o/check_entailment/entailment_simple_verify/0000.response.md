Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(tup)` indeed meets the problem description by extracting the last character of each string in the provided tuple. The annotations confirm that prior to the function call, `tup` is a tuple of strings, which matches the expected input type. The implementation correctly utilizes a list comprehension to gather the last character from each string, resulting in the expected output for the provided test cases.

Additionally, edge cases such as empty strings or an empty tuple do not negate the function's correctness within the given assumptions; we are operating under the premise that valid input will be provided. Therefore, the function behaves as intended based on the problem description and the accompanying test cases.

Consequently, there is sufficient evidence from both the original assessment and the annotated version to conclude that the program is correct as is, supporting the validity of the original assessment.
