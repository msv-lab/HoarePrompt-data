Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where one or more strings in the input tuple are empty. According to the output hints, accessing the last character of an empty string will raise an IndexError. Since the problem description does not specify that the input will always be valid (i.e., without empty strings), the program fails to account for this potential case. For example, calling `func_1(('', 'test'))` would result in an IndexError because it attempts to access the last character of the empty string. Therefore, the program is not correct for all potential cases as outlined in the problem description.
