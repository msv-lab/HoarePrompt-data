The provided program aims to extract the last character of each string in a given tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` will indeed achieve this for non-empty strings. However, according to the output hints, the function will raise an `IndexError` if any of the strings in the tuple is empty. 

This means that the program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement, specifically when an empty string is included in the tuple. An example that demonstrates this is the input `func_1(('abc', '', 'def'))`, which would raise an `IndexError`. 

Since the program fails to handle this edge case, it does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
