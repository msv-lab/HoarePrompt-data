Final: **False**

The original assessment of correctness is not accurate because it fails to account for the potential `IndexError` that arises when the tuple contains empty strings. The problem description specifies that the function is supposed to extract the last character of each string in the provided tuple, but the implementation does not include any checks for empty strings. As the output hints correctly indicate, if any string in the tuple is empty, accessing `s[-1]` will lead to an `IndexError`. Therefore, while the function may work as intended for the given test cases, it does not handle all conceivable inputs as specified in the problem description. This limitation must result in a final assessment of **False**.
