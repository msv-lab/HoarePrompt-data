Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function takes a tuple of strings as an input and returns a list that contains the last character of each string from that tuple.

1. The assertions provided confirm that the function works for given examples:
   - For the input `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, it returns `['s', 'r', 's']`, which correctly extracts the last character of each string.
   - For the input `('Avenge', 'for', 'People')`, it returns `['e', 'r', 'e']`, again correctly.
   - For the input `('Gotta', 'get', 'go')`, it returns `['a', 't', 'o']`, which is accurate.

2. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in tup]` succinctly and effectively retrieves the last character of each string in the tuple `tup`, which aligns perfectly with the specified task in the problem description.

3. The program does assume that the input will not contain empty strings, and while it may raise an `IndexError` in such cases, the problem description does not specify constraints on the input beyond it being a tuple of strings. Thus, given the understanding that valid input will be provided, this does not make the function incorrect according to the problem requirements.

Thus, since the function consistently fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all valid inputs, it is correct.
