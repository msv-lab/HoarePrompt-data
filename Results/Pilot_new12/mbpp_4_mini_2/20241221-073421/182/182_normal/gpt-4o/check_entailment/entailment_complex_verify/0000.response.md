Final: **False**

The original assessment claimed that the function `func_1` is correct and does not consider edge cases, particularly the case of empty strings. The annotated version explicitly states that if any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an `IndexError`. Since the problem description does not specify that inputs should be guaranteed to be non-empty strings, this constitutes a flaw in the programâ€™s correctness. Hence, the original assessment does not accurately reflect the function's behavior, warranting the conclusion that the program does not fully meet the expectations outlined in the problem description.
