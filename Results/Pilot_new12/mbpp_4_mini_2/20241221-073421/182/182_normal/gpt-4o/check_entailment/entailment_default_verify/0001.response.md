Final: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description completely because it does not handle cases where any string in the input tuple is empty. As indicated in the output hints, attempting to access the last character of an empty string would raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, while the function works correctly for non-empty strings, it fails when given tuples that include empty strings. As a result, the original assessment of correctness does not account for this limitation.
