#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple of strings.
def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]
    #The program returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter 'tup', which is a tuple of strings, and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, the function will raise an IndexError because the code attempts to access the last character of each string without validating their lengths. Therefore, users should ensure that no empty strings are present in the input tuple to avoid exceptions.
