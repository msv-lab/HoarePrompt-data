The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers, floats, or other lists (potentially nested). It recursively flattens this nested structure into a single list called `flat_list`, which contains all non-list elements from `nested_list` and any nested lists processed through the same function. The final state of the program after execution is that `flat_list` is returned, containing a flat representation of all the elements from the original `nested_list`. However, the function does not handle types other than lists, integers, or floats, and would not raise an error for unsupported types, which could lead to unexpected behavior in specific edge cases.
