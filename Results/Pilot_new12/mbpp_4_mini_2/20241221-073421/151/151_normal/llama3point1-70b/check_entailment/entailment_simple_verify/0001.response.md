Based on the provided problem description, the program `func_1` is designed to flatten a potentially nested list structure into a single list. The original assessment states that the correctness of the program is **True**, supporting this with examples that demonstrate the capability of the function to handle nested lists correctly.

The annotated code provides additional insights into the program's inner workings:
1. **Pre-function call state**: The input `nested_list` is specified as a potentially nested list, indicating the program is prepared to handle a variety of structures that include integers, floats, and other lists.
2. **Post-loop state**: After the for loop, `flat_list` is asserted to contain all elements from `nested_list` in a flattened manner, ensuring that all inner lists processed by recursive calls of `func_1` will contribute their elements to `flat_list`.

The annotated code aligns with the original assessment and confirms that:
- The approach is recursive, which is appropriate for flattening nested structures.
- The function effectively appends non-list elements and recursively flattens any lists.
- The state of `flat_list` after processing indicates that it successfully combines elements from nested lists.

Given this analysis, the program fulfills the problem's requirements, demonstrates correct functionality, and is affirmed by both the examples and annotations provided. The original assessment of correctness is consistent and valid.

Final: **True**
