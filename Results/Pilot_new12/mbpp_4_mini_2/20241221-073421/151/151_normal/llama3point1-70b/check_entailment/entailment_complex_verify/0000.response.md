Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program meets the problem description of flattening a nested list structure. The program effectively uses recursion to check each element in the provided `nested_list`. The annotations confirm that the program logic leads to `flat_list` containing all non-list elements in a flattened form. While the program does not account for types outside of lists, integers, or floats, the assumption is that inputs will be valid as stated in the problem description. Therefore, the function behaves as expected given the constraints, supporting the original conclusion of correctness.
