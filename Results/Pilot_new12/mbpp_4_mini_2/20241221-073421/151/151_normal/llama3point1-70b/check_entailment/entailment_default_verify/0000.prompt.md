You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to flatten a given nested list structure.
Program:
```
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
    return flat_list


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements a function to flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively checks each element in the input `nested_list`. If the element is itself a list, it calls the function `func_1` recursively, extending `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it is appended directly to `flat_list`.

This approach ensures that all levels of nesting are accounted for, and all non-list elements are collected into a single flat list. The function handles edge cases like empty lists, which also return an empty list, and it correctly processes lists containing mixed data types. There are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that are overlooked in the implementation. Thus, the program works as expected for the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers, floats, or other lists (potentially nested). It recursively flattens this nested structure into a single list called `flat_list`, which contains all non-list elements from `nested_list` and any nested lists processed through the same function. The final state of the program after execution is that `flat_list` is returned, containing a flat representation of all the elements from the original `nested_list`. However, the function does not handle types other than lists, integers, or floats, and would not raise an error for unsupported types, which could lead to unexpected behavior in specific edge cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
