Correctness: **False**

The provided program attempts to flatten a nested list structure, handling elements of type list, int, and float correctly. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle types other than lists, integers, or floats. This omission would lead to unexpected behavior when encountering unsupported types, such as strings or dictionaries. 

For example, if the input is `[[1, 2], ["a", [3]], 4]`, the function would raise an error when it tries to process the string "a", since it neither extends the list nor appends it to `flat_list` correctly. The function is incomplete and therefore does not fulfill the requirement of flattening any type of nested list thoroughly. 

This makes the program incorrect for cases involving unsupported types, and as such, it does not comply with the problem description for every potential case.
