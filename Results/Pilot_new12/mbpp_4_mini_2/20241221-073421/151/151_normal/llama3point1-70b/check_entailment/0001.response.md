Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to flatten a nested list structure. The recursive approach used in `func_1` ensures that it can handle lists of arbitrary depth. It checks if each element is a list, and if so, it recursively calls itself to flatten that inner list. If the element is not a list, it appends the element to the `flat_list`.

Here are some examples to demonstrate its correctness:

1. Input: `func_1([1, 2, [3, 4], 5])` would output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
2. Input: `func_1([[[1], 2], 3])` would output `[1, 2, 3]`.
3. Input: `func_1([])` would output `[]` (an empty list remains empty).
4. Input: `func_1([1, [2, [3, [4]]], 5])` would output `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

As can be seen, the function successfully flattens lists regardless of their structure or depth. It handles cases with varying levels of nesting, and non-list elements are appropriately appended. Since I cannot find any inputs for which this function would fail to perform the flattening correctly, the correctness is deemed to be true.
