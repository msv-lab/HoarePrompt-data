Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements a function to flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively checks each element in the input `nested_list`. If the element is itself a list, it calls the function `func_1` recursively, extending `flat_list` with the result. If the element is not a list, it is appended directly to `flat_list`.

This approach ensures that all levels of nesting are accounted for, and all non-list elements are collected into a single flat list. The function handles edge cases like empty lists, which also return an empty list, and it correctly processes lists containing mixed data types. There are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that are overlooked in the implementation. Thus, the program works as expected for the problem description.
