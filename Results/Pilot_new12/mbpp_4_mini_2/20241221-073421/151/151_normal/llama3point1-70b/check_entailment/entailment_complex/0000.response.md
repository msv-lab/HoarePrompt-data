Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a potentially nested list (`nested_list`) and flattens it into a single list (`flat_list`). 

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Recursive Flattening**: The function checks each element of `nested_list`. If an element is itself a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that element, effectively breaking down any nested lists into their constituent elements. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to flatten a nested list structure.

2. **Appending Non-List Elements**: If an element is not a list (i.e., it is either an integer, float, or other valid non-list types within the context of the problem), it directly appends that element to `flat_list`. This ensures all non-list elements are included in the final output.

3. **Final Output**: After processing all elements, the function returns `flat_list`, which contains all elements of the original `nested_list` in a flattened form, thereby achieving the goal of the specified problem.

4. **General Input Validity**: The explanation notes that the function does not raise errors for unsupported types, but since we assume the input will always be valid according to the problem description (a potentially nested list of integers and/or floats), this does not detract from the correctness of the implementation.

Overall, the program adheres strictly to what the problem description requires, thus validating its correctness.
