Final: **True**  

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure, and it successfully achieves this as per the problem description. The program uses a recursive approach to handle lists of arbitrary depth, checking each element to determine if it is a list or a non-list element. 

The output hints confirm that the function can flatten a variety of nested list structures, providing specific examples that demonstrate its functionality. While the output hints mention that the function does not handle types other than lists, integers, or floats, this is a consideration based on input assumptions. As stated, the problem description assumes valid input, meaning the function will not encounter incorrectly typed inputs that it cannot handle. Therefore, given the provided information and the successful handling of nested lists as demonstrated in the examples, the program is deemed to be correct in its function to flatten a nested list structure.
