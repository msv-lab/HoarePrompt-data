Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the flattening of a nested list structure as described in the problem statement. The reasoning is as follows:

1. The function `func_1` takes an input called `nested_list`, which can contain integers, floats, or other lists, and processes it recursively.
2. The program initializes an empty list called `flat_list` where it will store the flattened elements.
3. It iterates over each element `i` in `nested_list`:
   - If `i` is a list (checked using `type(i) == list`), it recursively calls `func_1(i)` to flatten that sublist and extends `flat_list` with its elements via `flat_list.extend()`.
   - If `i` is not a list (meaning it is either an integer, float, or any non-list type), it directly appends `i` to `flat_list`.
4. After processing all elements, the function returns `flat_list`, which contains all the individual elements from `nested_list`, fully flattened.

This method will handle any level of nested structures correctly and return a single list containing all values from the original nested structure in a flat manner.

Thus, the program perfectly fulfills the requirement of flattening a nested list as specified in the problem description.
