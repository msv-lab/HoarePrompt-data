#State of the program right berfore the function call: nested_list is a potentially nested list containing integers, floats, or other lists.
def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for i in nested_list:
        if type(i) == list:
            flat_list.extend(func_1(i))
        else:
            flat_list.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` contains all elements from `nested_list` flattened, with any values from the lists processed by `func_1`; `nested_list` can be any structure of lists or mixed elements.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns 'flat_list', which contains all elements from 'nested_list' flattened with any values from the lists processed by 'func_1'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers, floats, or other lists (potentially nested). It recursively flattens this nested structure into a single list called `flat_list`, which contains all non-list elements from `nested_list` and any nested lists processed through the same function. The final state of the program after execution is that `flat_list` is returned, containing a flat representation of all the elements from the original `nested_list`. However, the function does not handle types other than lists, integers, or floats, and would not raise an error for unsupported types, which could lead to unexpected behavior in specific edge cases.
