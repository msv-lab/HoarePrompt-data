The code appends the value of `i` to `flat_list`. The initial state indicates that `nested_list` has at least 2 elements and `i` is the next element in the list. As a result, `flat_list` now includes the value of `i` as an additional element. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in the list, and `flat_list` now contains the value of `i` appended to it.**
