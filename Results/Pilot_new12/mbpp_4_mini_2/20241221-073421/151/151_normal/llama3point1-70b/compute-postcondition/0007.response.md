According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 1 more element, the loop will continue. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` must have at least 1 element, and `i` is the current element being processed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, and `i` should be the next element in `nested_list`. 

State: **`nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in the list.**
