The variable `i`, which is the first element of `nested_list`, is passed to the function `func_1`. The output of `func_1(i)` will then be extended to `flat_list`. The previous values of `nested_list` and `flat_list` remain unaffected aside from the addition of the result from `func_1(i)`. 

Since `nested_list` must have at least one element, and `i` is defined as the first element of that list (which is a list itself), we can conclude that `flat_list` will now include the contents produced by `func_1(i)`.

Therefore, we retain the initial state conditions, and only add the new state of `flat_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` must have at least 1 element, `i` is a list (the first element of `nested_list`), and `flat_list` is extended by the return value of `func_1(i)`.**
