The code attempts to extend `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(i)`. Given that `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, we need to consider whether `i` is a list or a non-list value. The initial values of `nested_list` and `flat_list` will remain unchanged unless updated by `func_1(i)`.

If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` would be extended by the values returned from `func_1(i)`; if `i` is not a list, `flat_list` would be appended with the value of `i`. 

The specific outcome relies primarily on the definition and behavior of `func_1`.

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, and `flat_list` is extended by the return value of `func_1(i)` if `i` is a list, otherwise `flat_list` is appended with the value of `i`.**
