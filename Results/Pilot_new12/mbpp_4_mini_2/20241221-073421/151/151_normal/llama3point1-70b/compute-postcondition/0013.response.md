The code snippet given is `flat_list.append(i)`, which appends the value of `i` to the `flat_list`. Since `i` is assigned as the third element of `nested_list`, `i` will take the value of that specific element, and `flat_list` will have the value of `i` added to it.

The output state reflects this change as follows:

1. The variables that have been affected are `flat_list` and `i`.
2. The value of `i` is the third element of `nested_list`. 
3. `flat_list` is extended with the value of `i` appended.

Therefore, the output state is: `nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, and `flat_list` will now include the third element of `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` includes `i` appended to it**.
