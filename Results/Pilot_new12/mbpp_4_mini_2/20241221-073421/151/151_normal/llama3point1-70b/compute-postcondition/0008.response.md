The variable `flat_list` is extended by the result of the function `func_1(i)`, where `i` is the next element in the list. The content of `flat_list` changes by appending the output of `func_1(i)` to it, but the specific changes depend on the implementation of `func_1`. The values of other variables, including `nested_list` and `i`, are not affected.

Output State: **`nested_list` must have at least 2 elements, `i` is the next element in the list, `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(i)`.**
