According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third element. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 elements. 

Since `i` takes the next element in each iteration, we need to consider that `i` in the next iteration will be the third element of `nested_list`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 3 elements. 

In this case, since the current value of `i` will be the third element in the next iteration, the states will be adjusted accordingly.

State: **`nested_list` has at least 3 elements, `i` is the third element in the list, `flat_list` will be extended based on `func_1(i)` if `i` is a list, otherwise it will be appended with the value of `i`.**
