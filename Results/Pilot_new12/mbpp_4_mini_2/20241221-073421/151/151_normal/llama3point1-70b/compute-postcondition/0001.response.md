According to the code, the loop executes over `nested_list`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nested_list` must contain at least one element. The variable `i` will represent the first element of `nested_list` after the loop begins, and it is indexed at 0 before the loop starts. Since `flat_list` is currently empty, it does not influence the loop's execution.

State: **`nested_list` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list`**
