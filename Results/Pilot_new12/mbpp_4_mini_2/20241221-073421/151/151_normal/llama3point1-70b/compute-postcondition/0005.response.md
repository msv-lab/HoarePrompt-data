In this case, `flat_list` is a variable where the element `i` is appended. Since `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and it is not of type list, it can be directly added to `flat_list`. The content of `flat_list` is affected, but `nested_list` remains unchanged as it is not modified in the code.

Output State: **`nested_list` must have at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and `i` is not of type list, `flat_list` now includes `i`.**
