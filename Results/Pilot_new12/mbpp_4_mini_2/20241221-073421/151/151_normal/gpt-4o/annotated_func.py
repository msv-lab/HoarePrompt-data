def func_1(nested_list):

            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `flat_list` contains all non-list elements and the flattened contents of any lists found within `nested_list`; `nested_list` is the original list potentially containing other lists or non-list elements. If `nested_list` is empty, then `flat_list` is also empty.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns `flat_list`, which contains all non-list elements and the flattened contents of any lists found within `nested_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, then `flat_list` is also empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter called `nested_list`, which is a list that may contain other lists or non-list elements. It processes this list recursively, flattening any nested lists into a single list containing only non-list elements. The function returns a new list (`flat_list`) that includes all non-list elements from `nested_list` and the contents of any lists found within it, in the order they appeared. If `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list. There are no checks for non-iterable types beyond lists, meaning that if the input is not a list, it will be treated as a non-list element and included in the output. The function handles a variety of cases, including deeply nested lists, empty lists, and non-list elements.
