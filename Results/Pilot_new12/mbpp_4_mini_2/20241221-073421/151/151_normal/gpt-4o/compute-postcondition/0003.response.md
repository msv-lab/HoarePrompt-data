To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet:

- `flat_list` is currently an empty list.
- `item` is the first element of `nested_list`, and it is a list.
- `func_1(item)` will be called with `item` as an argument, which is expected to return some iterable (either a list or a generator) that will be added to `flat_list`.

After executing the line `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))`, `flat_list` will be modified to include the results of `func_1(item)`.

Therefore, the Output State, reflecting the changes, is as follows:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that has at least 1 item; `flat_list` is equal to the result of extending with `func_1(item)`; `item` is the first element of `nested_list`, and `item` is a list.**
