According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the `nested_list` contains at least one element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `flat_list` is still an empty list until elements are processed from `nested_list`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `nested_list` must contain at least 1 item, and `item` will represent the first element of the `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list that must have at least 1 item, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first element of `nested_list`**
