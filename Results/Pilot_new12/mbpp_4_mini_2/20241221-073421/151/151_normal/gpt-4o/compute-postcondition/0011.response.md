According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If there are at least 3 items in the `nested_list`, the loop will execute for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 2 items, and `item` is the second item in the list. Hence, for the loop to be executed one more time, `nested_list` must contain at least 3 items, and the next `item` will be the third item in the list.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the list**.
