The variable `item` is assigned the value of the third item in the `nested_list`, and the code appends this `item` to `flat_list`. The current contents of `flat_list` are not described, but it is assumed that the code modifies `flat_list` by adding another element (the value of `item`) to it. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the list, `flat_list` now includes `item`**.
