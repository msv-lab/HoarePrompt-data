The code extends `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)`, where `item` is the third item in the `nested_list`. The specific value of `item` is determined by its position in `nested_list`. 

Since the previous state states that `nested_list` has at least 3 items, `item` holds a specific value that corresponds to the third item of `nested_list`. The result of `func_1(item)` may generate a list (the output of that function is unknown), but it will modify `flat_list` by adding the elements from that result to it. 

The state of the other variables is unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the list, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)`.**
