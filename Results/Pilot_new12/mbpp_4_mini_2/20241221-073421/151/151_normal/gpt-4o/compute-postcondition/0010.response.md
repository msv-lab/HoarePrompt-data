Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items and `item` is the second item in the list. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` contains the result of extending it with `func_1(item)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains the original contents plus `item`, resulting in `flat_list` containing one more element, which is `item`.***
