Given the provided initial state and the loop code, here's the analysis of the final output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing.

Initial State: `nested_list` is a list that may contain other lists or non-list elements; `flat_list` is an empty list.

The code iterates through each `item` in `nested_list`. If `item` is a list, it extends `flat_list` with the result from `func_1(item)`. If `item` is not a list, it appends `item` to `flat_list`.

- If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `flat_list` remains empty.
- If `nested_list` has items, then for each `item` in `nested_list`, `flat_list` will be populated with either the elements from the nested lists (if `item` is a list) or the non-list elements directly appended.

After considering the iterations and what was provided:

Output State: **`flat_list` contains all non-list elements and the flattened contents of any lists found within `nested_list`; `nested_list` is the original list potentially containing other lists or non-list elements. If `nested_list` is empty, then `flat_list` is also empty.**
