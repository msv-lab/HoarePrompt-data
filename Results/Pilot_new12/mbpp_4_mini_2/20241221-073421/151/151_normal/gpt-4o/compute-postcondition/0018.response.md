Functionality: ** The function accepts a parameter called `nested_list`, which is a list that may contain other lists or non-list elements. It processes this list recursively, flattening any nested lists into a single list containing only non-list elements. The function returns a new list (`flat_list`) that includes all non-list elements from `nested_list` and the contents of any lists found within it, in the order they appeared. If `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list. There are no checks for non-iterable types beyond lists, meaning that if the input is not a list, it will be treated as a non-list element and included in the output. The function handles a variety of cases, including deeply nested lists, empty lists, and non-list elements.**
