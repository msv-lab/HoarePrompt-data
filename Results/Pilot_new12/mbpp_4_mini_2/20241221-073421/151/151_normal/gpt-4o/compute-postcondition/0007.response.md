According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If the list has at least 2 items, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 item. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `nested_list` must have at least 2 items, and `item` will be the second item in the list. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 items, `item` is the second item in the list, `flat_list` is equal to the result of extending it with `func_1(item)` if `item` is a list; otherwise, it contains `item`.**
