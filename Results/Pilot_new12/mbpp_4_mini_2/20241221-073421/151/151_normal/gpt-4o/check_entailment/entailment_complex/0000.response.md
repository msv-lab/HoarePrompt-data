Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to flatten a given nested list structure. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Recursive Flattening**: The function `func_1` processes a list (`nested_list`) that may contain both non-list elements and other lists. It utilizes recursion to handle nested lists, ensuring that any level of nesting is effectively flattened.

2. **Appending Non-list Elements**: Non-list elements are appended directly to the `flat_list`, ensuring that they are included in the final output as required.

3. **Use of `extend()`**: When a list is encountered, the function recursively calls itself and uses the `extend()` method to add the flattened contents of the sublist to the `flat_list`. This guarantees all elements from the nested lists are included in the order they appear.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program can handle various cases such as deeply nested lists, empty lists, and non-list elements. If `nested_list` is empty, the function returns an empty list, which aligns with the expected behavior.

5. **Order Preservation**: The approach used ensures that the order of elements is preserved exactly as they were presented in the original `nested_list`.

In light of these points, it is clear that the program fulfills the requirements stated in the problem description, and thus the correctness statement is justified.
