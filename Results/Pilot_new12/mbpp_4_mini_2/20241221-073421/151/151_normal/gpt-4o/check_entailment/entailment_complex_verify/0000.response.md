Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies the function `func_1` as a correct implementation for flattening nested lists. The provided assertions confirm that the function is able to handle various nested structures and returns the expected flat lists. The annotations further clarify that the `flat_list` will contain all non-list elements and the contents of any nested lists in the order they appeared, which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the function's design anticipates valid input as stipulated, effectively managing both empty lists and various levels of nesting. Thus, the overall reasoning and conclusion of the original assessment stand justified and accurate.
