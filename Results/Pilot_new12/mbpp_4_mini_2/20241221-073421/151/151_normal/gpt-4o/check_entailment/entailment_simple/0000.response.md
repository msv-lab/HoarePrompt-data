Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement to flatten a nested list structure. Here’s why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is intended to take a nested list (which may contain other lists) and return a single list containing all the non-list elements from the nested structure in a flattened form.

2. **Recursive Logic**: The implementation uses recursion to handle any depth of nesting. If an item in the `nested_list` is found to be a list, the function calls itself (`func_1(item)`) to flatten that sub-list and extends the `flat_list` with these flattened elements. If the item is not a list, it is appended directly to `flat_list`.

3. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions provided test the function against a variety of nested list inputs, verifying that the output matches the expected flattened list:
   - The first assertion checks a mixed nested structure and confirms that all elements are present in the correct, flat format.
   - The second and third assertions test other variations of nested lists, confirming that even multiple layers of nested lists can be flattened correctly.

4. **Handling of Various Inputs**: The function gracefully handles cases where elements vary in structure — it will keep flattening until all lists are exhausted, thus ensuring that it meets the requirements even with deeper or more complex nesting.

Therefore, the implementation fulfills the problem requirements by properly flattening any nested list input provided to it, as demonstrated by the assertions. Thus, we conclude that the program is correct.
