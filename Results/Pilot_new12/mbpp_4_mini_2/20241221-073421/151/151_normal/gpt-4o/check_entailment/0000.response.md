Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly flattens nested lists of any depth into a single list. It recursively checks if an item in the list is itself a list. If it is, the function calls itself to flatten that list and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the item is not a list, it is simply appended to `flat_list`. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works for various nested list structures and returns the expected flat lists. There are no potential edge cases or inputs that would cause the function to fail as it handles both empty lists and lists with different nesting levels effectively.
