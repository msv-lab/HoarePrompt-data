Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure. While it works as expected for deeply nested lists and non-empty cases, the output hints indicate that if the input is not a list, it will be treated as a non-list element and included in the output without any checks or handling for non-iterable types. This means that if the input is a nested structure that contains a non-list element like a string or a dictionary, it could lead to errors or unexpected results. For example, if the input is `[1, "string", [2, 3]]`, it would incorrectly try to process the string as a list, potentially resulting in an error. Therefore, the program fails to fully meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
