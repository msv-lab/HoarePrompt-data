Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure as described in the problem statement. The annotated version of the code corroborates this by detailing the state of the program before and after the function processes the input. 

The annotations confirm that the function processes each item in the `nested_list`, extending the `flat_list` when encountering sublists and appending non-list items. This recursive behavior ensures that all elements, regardless of depth in the nesting, are flattened correctly. The assertions provided are representative of the required behavior and demonstrate that the function yields the expected outputs for different nested structures. 

Furthermore, the program is assumed to handle valid inputs, and there are no indications of edge cases that would disrupt its functionality. Therefore, the conclusion that the program meets the problem description is substantiated by both the original assessment and the state demonstrated through the annotations.
