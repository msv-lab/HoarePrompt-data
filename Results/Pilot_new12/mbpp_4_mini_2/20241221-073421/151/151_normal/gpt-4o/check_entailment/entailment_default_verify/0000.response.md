Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The program `func_1` successfully addresses the problem description by flattening nested lists into a single list containing only non-list elements, as required. The assertions provided verify that the function performs correctly with various nested list structures, including cases with different depths and configurations. 

The output hints further confirm that the function is capable of handling empty lists and will return an empty list in such cases. While it is noted that non-list elements will be treated as valid inputs if present, this aligns with the assumed constraints of receiving a valid input list and does not detract from the core functionality of the flattening process. 

Thus, the combined evidence from the program, the output hints, and the initial assessment leads to the conclusion that the program is correct.
