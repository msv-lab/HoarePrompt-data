Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly flattens nested lists as per the problem description. It efficiently handles various cases of nested lists, returning a single flattened list while maintaining the order of elements as specified. The output hints further confirm the functionality of the program, including its handling of empty input and various list structures. Although the function does not explicitly check for non-list types beyond lists, the assumptions state that input will always be a valid list, which supports its correctness. Overall, the function aligns with the intended functionality and successfully passes the provided assertions.
