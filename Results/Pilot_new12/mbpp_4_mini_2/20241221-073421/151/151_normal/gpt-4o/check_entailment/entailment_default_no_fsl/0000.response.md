Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` flattens nested lists as described, but it improperly includes non-list elements without checking their type beyond lists. According to the output hints, if the input contains non-iterable types that are not lists (like integers or strings), they will be treated as non-list elements and included in the output. While the parsing logic for nested lists is correct, there is a potential issue when arbitrary non-list items are included as input.

For example, when provided with an input like `func_1(42)`, this would raise an assertion error since the input is not a list, yet the program does not explicitly handle such cases. This could lead to unexpected behavior if the input happens to be an integer, a string, or any object that does not conform to being a list.

Thus, while it works for lists and nested lists correctly, it does not correctly handle what happens when the input is something entirely different from a list, leading to potential inconsistencies and making it incorrect according to the problem requirements that specify handling arbitrary nested structures reliably. 

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements in every potential case, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
