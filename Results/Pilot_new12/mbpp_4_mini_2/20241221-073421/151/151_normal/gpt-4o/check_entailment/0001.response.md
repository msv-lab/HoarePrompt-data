Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` successfully flattens a nested list structure into a single list. It does so by recursively checking each item in the passed `nested_list`. If an item is itself a list, it calls `func_1` on that item, otherwise, it appends the item directly to the resulting `flat_list`. 

The program handles different cases as evidenced by the assertions provided:

1. It correctly flattens lists containing both integers and nested lists.
2. The function handles multiple levels of nesting, as shown in the first test case where elements are deeply nested.
3. It correctly processes lists with varying lengths and structures, maintaining the input order.

Since I couldn't identify any potential edge cases where the function fails to meet the requirements or return incorrect results, the code is correct.
