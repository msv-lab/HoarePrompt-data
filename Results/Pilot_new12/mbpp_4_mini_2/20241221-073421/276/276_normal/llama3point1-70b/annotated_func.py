#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers of the same size, and size is a positive integer equal to the length of list1 and list2.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, `size` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, `median` is the average of `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`. If `size` is odd, `median` is the value at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median, which is determined based on whether `size` is even or odd from the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the median is the average of `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`. If `size` is odd, the median is the value at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) of the same size and a positive integer (`size`) representing their length. It merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and calculates the median value based on whether the `size` is even or odd. If `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the sorted list. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements. The function assumes that the input lists have the same length as indicated by `size`. However, it lacks input validation to ensure that `list1` and `list2` are of the expected lengths and that `size` is indeed a positive integer, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior if the assumptions are not met.
