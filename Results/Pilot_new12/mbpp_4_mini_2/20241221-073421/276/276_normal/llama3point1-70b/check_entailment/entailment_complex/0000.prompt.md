You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers of the same size, and size is a positive integer equal to the length of list1 and list2.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, `size` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, `median` is the average of `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`. If `size` is odd, `median` is the value at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median, which is determined based on whether `size` is even or odd from the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the median is the average of `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`. If `size` is odd, the median is the value at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) of the same size and a positive integer (`size`) representing their length. It merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and calculates the median value based on whether the `size` is even or odd. If `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the sorted list. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements. The function assumes that the input lists have the same length as indicated by `size`. However, it lacks input validation to ensure that `list1` and `list2` are of the expected lengths and that `size` is indeed a positive integer, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior if the assumptions are not met.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
