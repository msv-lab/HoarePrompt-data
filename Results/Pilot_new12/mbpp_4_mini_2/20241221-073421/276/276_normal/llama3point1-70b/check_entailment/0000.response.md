Correctness: **False**.

The program has a logic error in determining the median. The problem statement asks for the median of two sorted lists of the same size. For a sorted list, the median should be calculated using the correct indices for a merged list of length 2*size. 

In the program, the code calculates `middle_index = size - 1`, which does not correctly account for finding the median in a merged list of size `2*size`. The correct middle indices for finding the median would be `size - 1` and `size` for the case of even sizes.

Specifically: 
If `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, which both have a size of 2, the merged sorted list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The median should then be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, with the current implementation, the calculation of `median` will be incorrect due to the indexing issue.

Thus, it does not correctly find the median for both even-sized lists.
