The program attempts to find the median of two sorted lists by merging them, sorting the combined list, and then determining the median based on whether the total number of elements is odd or even. 

However, there is an issue with the implementation regarding how it calculates the indices for finding the median, particularly when considering even sizes. The code uses `middle_index = size - 1`, which is incorrect for even-sized lists because it does not properly select the two middle elements when calculating the median for an even number of total elements.

For example, if `size` is 4 (meaning the merged list has 8 elements), the correct middle elements would actually be at positions `size//2 - 1` and `size//2`, which correspond to indices 3 and 4 for a zero-based index list. The current implementation does not correctly handle this logic.

Therefore, considering these issues:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function lacks the correct indexing to compute the median when the combined list size is even. For instance, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, `sorted(list1 + list2)` produces `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, but the current code will incorrectly calculate the median.
