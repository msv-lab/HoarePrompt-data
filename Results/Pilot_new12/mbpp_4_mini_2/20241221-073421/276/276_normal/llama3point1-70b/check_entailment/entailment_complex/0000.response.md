Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not work correctly according to the problem description for all scenarios. Specifically, the mistake occurs in the calculation of the `middle_index`. The variable `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which is incorrect for finding the median in a merged list of two sorted lists. 

The correct index for the middle element should depend on whether the combined list has an even or odd length. When the total length of the merged list (which is `2 * size`) is odd, the median should be the middle element at index `size - 1`. Conversely, when the total length is even, the median should be the average of the elements at indices `size - 1` and `size`, ensuring that we correctly retrieve the two middle values from the combined and sorted list.

Therefore, it does not always follow the problem description that asks for the median of two sorted lists of the same size.
