Correctness: **False**

The program does not adhere to the problem description for the following reasons:

1. The problem states that the function should find the **median of two sorted lists of the same size**. However, the logic inside the function assumes that the `size` parameter represents the total number of elements in the merged list, which would be **2 * size**. This misunderstanding leads to incorrect indexing.

2. Specifically, for an even size, the line:
   ```python
   middle_index = size - 1
   ```
   calculates the index incorrectly. For two sorted lists of size `size`, the merged list will have a size of `2 * size`, and the correct middle point for an even-length list should be calculated differently. The correct middle indices for the median calculation in the case of two even-sized lists would be `size - 1` and `size`.

3. The `if` condition to check for odd/even sizes (`size % 2 == 0`) is irrelevant because, in the problem context, the two lists combined will always have an even number of elements (2 * size). Hence, the logic should only cater for even-sized lists and calculate the average of the two middle numbers.

Thus, the program fails to correctly compute the median, thereby violating the requirement laid out in the problem description.
