The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect because the calculation of the median was not performed on the correct indices for a merged list of size `2 * size`. The median should be derived from the values at `size - 1` and `size` indices for an even-sized merged list, but it was evaluated incorrectly.

Upon analyzing the annotated version of the code, it explicitly confirms that `merged_list` contains all elements from both `list1` and `list2`, and is sorted. However, the program continues to use `middle_index = size - 1`, which leads to a flawed understanding in calculating the median for the merged lists. Particularly, when `size` is even the median should indeed be the average of the elements at indices `size - 1` and `size`, but this implementation only accesses one index (`middle_index`) and grabs the next element (`middle_index + 1`), which is also incorrect under the intended requirements of accessing `size` elements for calculating the median.

Thus, the original assessment aligns with both the problem description and the annotated states, validating that the program does not meet the requirement for correctly determining the median of the two sorted lists of the same size.

Final: **False**
