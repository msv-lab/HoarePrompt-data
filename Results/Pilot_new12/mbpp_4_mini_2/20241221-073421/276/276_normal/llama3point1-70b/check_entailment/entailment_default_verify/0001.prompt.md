You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program has an issue in handling the calculation of the median when the size of the lists is even. 

1. The `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which leads to incorrect median calculations. The correct indices for the two middle elements in a merged sorted list of even size should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`, not `size - 1` and `size`. 

For example, consider two sorted lists:
- `list1 = [1, 3]`
- `list2 = [2, 4]`
- `size = 2`

The merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The two median indices would be `1` and `2`, giving us elements `2` and `3`. The correct median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, the program would incorrectly use indices `1` and `2` (which it mistakenly defines) leading to incorrect calculations.

Thus, the code fails for this and potentially other similar cases where the list size is even.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) of the same size and a positive integer (`size`) representing their length. It merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and calculates the median value based on whether the `size` is even or odd. If `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the sorted list. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements. The function assumes that the input lists have the same length as indicated by `size`. However, it lacks input validation to ensure that `list1` and `list2` are of the expected lengths and that `size` is indeed a positive integer, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior if the assumptions are not met.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
