Correctness: **False**

The provided program has an issue in handling the calculation of the median when the size of the lists is even. 

1. The `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which leads to incorrect median calculations. The correct indices for the two middle elements in a merged sorted list of even size should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`, not `size - 1` and `size`. 

For example, consider two sorted lists:
- `list1 = [1, 3]`
- `list2 = [2, 4]`
- `size = 2`

The merged list would be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The two median indices would be `1` and `2`, giving us elements `2` and `3`. The correct median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, the program would incorrectly use indices `1` and `2` (which it mistakenly defines) leading to incorrect calculations.

Thus, the code fails for this and potentially other similar cases where the list size is even.
