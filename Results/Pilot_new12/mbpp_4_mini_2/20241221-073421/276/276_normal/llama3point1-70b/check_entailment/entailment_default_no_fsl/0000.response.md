Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly calculate the median for two sorted lists of the same size due to the following issues:

1. The `middle_index` calculation is incorrect for finding the median when the size is even. In the code, `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, but for even sizes, the two middle elements should be at indexes `size//2 - 1` and `size//2`. Thus, the correct calculation to access the middle elements for even sizes is not implemented correctly.

2. The code does not validate the input sizes of `list1` and `list2` against the provided `size` parameter. If either list does not match the `size`, this could lead to incorrect behavior.

For these reasons, the program does not meet the problem requirements for every potential case. For example, for input lists `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` with size 2, the correct median should be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, but the program does not correctly compute this value in its current form.
