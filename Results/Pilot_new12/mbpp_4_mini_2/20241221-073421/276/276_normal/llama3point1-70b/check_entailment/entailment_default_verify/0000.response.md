Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies a logic error in the function `func_1`. The function is supposed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, which means that after merging these two lists, the total length will be `2 * size`. The middle indices for an even-sized merged list should be calculated correctly, taking into account that the merged list will have indices ranging from `0` to `2 * size - 1`. The code incorrectly calculates the `middle_index`, leading to an incorrect median calculation when `size` is even.

For example, given `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]` (both with size 2), the expected median is `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, with the current implementation, the calculation does not yield the correct result due to the wrong `middle_index` being used.

Therefore, the original assessment pointing out that the function does not correctly find the median for both even-sized lists remains valid.
