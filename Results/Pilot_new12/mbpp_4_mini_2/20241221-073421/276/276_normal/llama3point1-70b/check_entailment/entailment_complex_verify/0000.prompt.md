You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program has a logic error in determining the median. The problem statement asks for the median of two sorted lists of the same size. For a sorted list, the median should be calculated using the correct indices for a merged list of length 2*size. 

In the program, the code calculates `middle_index = size - 1`, which does not correctly account for finding the median in a merged list of size `2*size`. The correct middle indices for finding the median would be `size - 1` and `size` for the case of even sizes.

Specifically: 
If `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, which both have a size of 2, the merged sorted list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The median should then be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`. However, with the current implementation, the calculation of `median` will be incorrect due to the indexing issue.

Thus, it does not correctly find the median for both even-sized lists.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers of the same size, and size is a positive integer equal to the length of list1 and list2.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, `size` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, `median` is the average of `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`. If `size` is odd, `median` is the value at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median, which is determined based on whether `size` is even or odd from the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the median is the average of `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`. If `size` is odd, the median is the value at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) of the same size and a positive integer (`size`) representing their length. It merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and calculates the median value based on whether the `size` is even or odd. If `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the sorted list. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements. The function assumes that the input lists have the same length as indicated by `size`. However, it lacks input validation to ensure that `list1` and `list2` are of the expected lengths and that `size` is indeed a positive integer, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior if the assumptions are not met.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
