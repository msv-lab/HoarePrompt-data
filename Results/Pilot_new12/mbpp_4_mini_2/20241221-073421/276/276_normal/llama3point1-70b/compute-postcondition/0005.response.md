The value of `median` is assigned the value at `middle_index` of `merged_list`. Since `size` is a positive odd integer, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`, which gives us a specific index to retrieve from `merged_list`. The states of the other variables (`list1`, `list2`, `size`, `merged_list`) are not affected, so we can represent them as is.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `size` is a positive odd integer, `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`, `middle_index` is `size - 1`, and `median` is the value at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.**
