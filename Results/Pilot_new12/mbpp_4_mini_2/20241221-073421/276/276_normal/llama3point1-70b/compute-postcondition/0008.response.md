The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers and must be of the same size, which is specified by the positive integer `size`, equal to the length of `list1` and `list2`. After executing the function body, the function returns the median value determined from the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle values; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle value at the corresponding index. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of integers and their size, and return the median of the combined sorted values from those lists based on whether the size is even or odd. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers (list1 and list2) and a positive integer (size) representing their length, returning the median from the sorted combination of those lists.**
