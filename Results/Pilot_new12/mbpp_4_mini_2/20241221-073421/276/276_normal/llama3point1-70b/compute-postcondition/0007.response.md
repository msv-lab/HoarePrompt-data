Output State: **The program returns the median, which is determined based on whether `size` is even or odd from the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the median is the average of `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`. If `size` is odd, the median is the value at index `middle_index` in `merged_list`.**
