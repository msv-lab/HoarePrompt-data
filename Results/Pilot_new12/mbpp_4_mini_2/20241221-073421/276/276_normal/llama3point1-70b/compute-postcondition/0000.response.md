The `merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. Since `list1` and `list2` are both lists of integers of the same size and size is a positive integer, `merged_list` will be a new list that contains all the integers from both `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order.

Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `merged_list`, while retaining that `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `size` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`.**
