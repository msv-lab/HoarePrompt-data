Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) of the same size and a positive integer (`size`) representing their length. It merges the two lists, sorts the combined list, and calculates the median value based on whether the `size` is even or odd. If `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the sorted list. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements. The function assumes that the input lists have the same length as indicated by `size`. However, it lacks input validation to ensure that `list1` and `list2` are of the expected lengths and that `size` is indeed a positive integer, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior if the assumptions are not met.**
