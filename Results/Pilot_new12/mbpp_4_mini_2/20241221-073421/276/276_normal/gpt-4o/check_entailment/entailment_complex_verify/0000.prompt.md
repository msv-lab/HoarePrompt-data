You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code.

The problem requires a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The code merges the two lists, sorts them, and then calculates the median based on the merged list.

### Code Analysis:
1. The function takes two sorted lists and their size as arguments.
2. It merges the two lists and sorts the result.
3. It then calculates the median based on the length of the merged list:
   - If the length of the merged list is even, it averages the two middle elements.
   - If the length is odd, it returns the middle element.

### Check for Potential Issues:
- If the input lists are not sorted, the function would not provide the correct median. The problem description specifies that the input lists are sorted, so this should not be an issue.
- The provided assertions test the function with examples and expect the correct median results.

### Edge Cases:
- If the function is given completely identical lists (e.g., both lists are `[1, 2, 3]`), it should still correctly compute the median but relies on the sorting.
- The function doesnâ€™t explicitly handle empty lists, which may be a consideration even though the problem specifies "sorted lists of the same size."

However, since the problem describes the input as being in sorted order and of the same size, we assume that the input adheres to these expectations.

### Conclusion:
As there doesn't appear to be any scenarios in which the function fails to meet the problem description based on the provided assumptions and the test cases work correctly, we conclude that the program is:

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly handles calculating the median of two sorted lists of the same size in the context provided.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists of integers and have the same size n, where n is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is the sorted list of integers from `list1 + list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, then `mid` is equal to `(len(list1) + len(list2)) // 2` and `median` is calculated as `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, then `mid` is equal to `(len(list1) + len(list2)) // 2` and `median` is equal to `merged_list[mid]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the sorted merged list 'merged_list' which is formed from the integers in 'list1' and 'list2'. If 'merged_list' has an even length, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers; if odd, it is the middle number itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, which must both be of the same size `n` (where `n` is a positive integer). It merges these two lists, sorts the combined list, and calculates the median of the sorted list. If the combined sorted list has an even length, the median is computed as the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element itself. The function returns this median value. However, the function does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or where their lengths do not match, which could lead to errors or incorrect behavior.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
