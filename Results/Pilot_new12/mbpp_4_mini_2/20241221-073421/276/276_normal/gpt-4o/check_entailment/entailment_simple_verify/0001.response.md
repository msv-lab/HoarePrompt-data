Given the problem description, program, original assessment, and annotated version, I will assess the correctness of the program systematically.

### Review of the Original Assessment:
1. **Correctness of the Problem Statement**: The task is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.
2. **Function Logic**:
   - The function merges the two lists and sorts them, which is correct but inefficient since the lists are already sorted.
   - The calculation of the median is accurately handled based on whether the merged list's length is odd or even.
3. **Edge Case Handling**: The original assessment highlighted a potential failure when handling empty lists. Although the problem description assumes valid inputs, it is critical to note that the function does not handle such cases.

### Evaluation of the Annotated Version:
- The annotations confirm that the function correctly computes the median given that valid inputs are provided (sorted lists of the same size).
- The program's logic is consistent with the annotations at each step, making it clear that it adheres to the stated requirements of the problem. It establishes that after merging and sorting, the `median` is determined correctly.

### Conclusion:
Considering the annotated code supports the implementation's correctness when operating under the assumptions of valid input:

1. The assertions provided test cases validate that `func_1` works as expected for sorted lists of the same size.
2. The program meets the necessary requirements of the problem description for valid inputs, disregarding edge cases that involve inputs outside this specification.

Thus, I will maintain the conclusion that the function is correct based on the improper handling of edge cases. Although these edge cases can indicate potential flaws, they do not pertain to our specific testing scenario given the assurances about input validity.

Final: **True**
