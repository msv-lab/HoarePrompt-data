The program provided is intended to compute the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Upon reviewing the implementation and the original assessment, we observe the following:
 
1. The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists and a positive integer representing their length. It merges and sorts these two lists, then computes and returns the median.

2. According to the problem description, the function should correctly compute the median based on two sorted lists of equal size, and the provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for those inputs.

3. The function correctly merges the lists, calculates the median based on the sorted list, and meets the requirements of the problem statement given that no empty lists need to be considered as input based on the problem scope.

4. The original assessment correctly pointed out that the function does not handle edge cases such as empty lists; however, it also stated that we assume valid input will always be provided. This assumption leads to the conclusion that, under normal operational conditions, the function will produce the correct results for the types of inputs it expects.

5. The annotations provided further validate the logic within the function, showing that it accurately calculates the median. Since the annotations ensure that both lists are of the appropriate structure and size prior to the function execution, they reinforce the correctness of the program.

Taking these points into account, despite the notes on edge cases, the program correctly implements the expected functionality for the inputs described in the problem statement.

Final: **True**
