Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the task of finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size, as specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Signature:** The function `func_1` takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) and an integer `n`, which denotes the size of each list. The size of the lists is correctly used to assert that both lists are of equal length.

2. **Merging and Sorting:** The program merges the two lists into one by concatenating them with `list1 + list2`, and then it sorts this merged list. This step is crucial to ensure that the median can be calculated accurately.

3. **Median Calculation:**
   - The program correctly calculates the median from the merged sorted list. It checks if the length of the merged list is even or odd:
     - If the length is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers using the indices `mid - 1` and `mid`.
     - If the length is odd, it retrieves the middle element using the index `mid`.

4. **Return Value:** The function finally returns the calculated median, fulfilling the requirement of returning the median value based on the input lists.

5. **Handling Assumptions:** The solution operates under the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., the lists will always have the same size and contain integers). The function does not crash or behave incorrectly in any potential case that is specified in the problem description, provided the inputs adhere to these assumptions.

Overall, the program effectively implements the logic needed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description as outlined.
