To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem statement and the implementation.

### Problem Statement:
The task is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Program Overview:
The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists and an integer `n` representing their size. Inside the function:
1. It merges the two lists and sorts them.
2. It then calculates the median based on whether the merged list's length is odd or even.

### Analysis:
1. **Merging and Sorting**: The approach merges the two lists and sorts them. While this works fine, it doesn't take into consideration that the lists are already sortedâ€”hence, it can be optimized to find the median without resorting.
  
2. **Calculating the Median**: The median is correctly computed based on the sorted merged list. However, we must also check if there are edge cases that the function does not handle, such as:
   - Empty lists.
   - Lists with negative numbers.
   - Lists with duplicate elements.

### Edge Case Testing:
- **Empty Lists**: If both lists are empty, the function should either raise an exception or handle it gracefully. Providing `func_1([], [], 0)` is an example where the function does not have a defined behavior, which means it will fail:
    ```python
    print(func_1([], [], 0))  # This will raise an error or behave unexpectedly.
    ```

Since the function does not handle the case of empty lists and will fail in such scenarios, we can conclude that it does not satisfy the requirements for every potential case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**
