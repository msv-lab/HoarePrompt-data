You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem statement and the implementation.

### Problem Statement:
The task is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Program Overview:
The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists and an integer `n` representing their size. Inside the function:
1. It merges the two lists and sorts them.
2. It then calculates the median based on whether the merged list's length is odd or even.

### Analysis:
1. **Merging and Sorting**: The approach merges the two lists and sorts them. While this works fine, it doesn't take into consideration that the lists are already sortedâ€”hence, it can be optimized to find the median without resorting.
  
2. **Calculating the Median**: The median is correctly computed based on the sorted merged list. However, we must also check if there are edge cases that the function does not handle, such as:
   - Empty lists.
   - Lists with negative numbers.
   - Lists with duplicate elements.

### Edge Case Testing:
- **Empty Lists**: If both lists are empty, the function should either raise an exception or handle it gracefully. Providing `func_1([], [], 0)` is an example where the function does not have a defined behavior, which means it will fail:
    ```python
    print(func_1([], [], 0))  # This will raise an error or behave unexpectedly.
    ```

Since the function does not handle the case of empty lists and will fail in such scenarios, we can conclude that it does not satisfy the requirements for every potential case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, which must both be of the same size `n` (where `n` is a positive integer). It merges these two lists, sorts the combined list, and calculates the median of the sorted list. If the combined sorted list has an even length, the median is computed as the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element itself. The function returns this median value. However, the function does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or where their lengths do not match, which could lead to errors or incorrect behavior.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
