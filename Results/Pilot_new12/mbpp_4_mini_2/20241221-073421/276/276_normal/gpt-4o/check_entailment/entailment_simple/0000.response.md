Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Combining Lists**: The program takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) and combines them using the `+` operator.

2. **Sorting the Combined List**: It sorts the combined list using `sorted()`, which ensures that the order of elements is correct, regardless of the order in the input lists.

3. **Calculating Median**:
   - The code properly calculates the middle index (`mid`) of the sorted merged list.
   - It checks if the length of the merged list is even or odd:
     - For an even length, it correctly averages the two middle elements to determine the median.
     - For an odd length, it returns the middle element directly.
   - However, since the problem specifies that both lists are of the same size, the combined list will always be of even length (2n, where n is the size of each input list).

4. **Return Value**: The computed median is returned from the function, consistent with the requirement to return the median of the two lists.

All assertions provided demonstrate that the function produces the correct output for different valid inputs. Additionally, the program assumes valid inputs and handles them correctly so that it will work under the outlined conditions. Thus, the implementation is both effective and meets the problem's criteria.
