You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[mid]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the problem statement and the implementation.

### Problem Statement:
The task is to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size.

### Program Overview:
The function `func_1` takes two sorted lists and an integer `n` representing their size. Inside the function:
1. It merges the two lists and sorts them.
2. It then calculates the median based on whether the merged list's length is odd or even.

### Analysis:
1. **Merging and Sorting**: The approach merges the two lists and sorts them. While this works fine, it doesn't take into consideration that the lists are already sortedâ€”hence, it can be optimized to find the median without resorting.
  
2. **Calculating the Median**: The median is correctly computed based on the sorted merged list. However, we must also check if there are edge cases that the function does not handle, such as:
   - Empty lists.
   - Lists with negative numbers.
   - Lists with duplicate elements.

### Edge Case Testing:
- **Empty Lists**: If both lists are empty, the function should either raise an exception or handle it gracefully. Providing `func_1([], [], 0)` is an example where the function does not have a defined behavior, which means it will fail:
    ```python
    print(func_1([], [], 0))  # This will raise an error or behave unexpectedly.
    ```

Since the function does not handle the case of empty lists and will fail in such scenarios, we can conclude that it does not satisfy the requirements for every potential case.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0
assert func_1([2, 4, 8, 9], [7, 13, 19, 28], 4) == 8.5
assert func_1([3, 6, 14, 23, 36, 42], [2, 18, 27, 39, 49, 55], 6) == 25.0

#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists of integers and have the same size n, where n is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is the sorted list of integers from `list1 + list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, then `mid` is equal to `(len(list1) + len(list2)) // 2` and `median` is calculated as `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, then `mid` is equal to `(len(list1) + len(list2)) // 2` and `median` is equal to `merged_list[mid]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the sorted merged list 'merged_list' which is formed from the integers in 'list1' and 'list2'. If 'merged_list' has an even length, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers; if odd, it is the middle number itself.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
