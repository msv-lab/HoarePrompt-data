#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both lists of integers and have the same size n, where n is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, n):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    mid = len(merged_list) // 2
    if (len(merged_list) % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[mid]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, `n` is a positive integer, and `merged_list` is the sorted list of integers from `list1 + list2`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, then `mid` is equal to `(len(list1) + len(list2)) // 2` and `median` is calculated as `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, then `mid` is equal to `(len(list1) + len(list2)) // 2` and `median` is equal to `merged_list[mid]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the sorted merged list 'merged_list' which is formed from the integers in 'list1' and 'list2'. If 'merged_list' has an even length, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers; if odd, it is the middle number itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, which must both be of the same size `n` (where `n` is a positive integer). It merges these two lists, sorts the combined list, and calculates the median of the sorted list. If the combined sorted list has an even length, the median is computed as the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element itself. The function returns this median value. However, the function does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or where their lengths do not match, which could lead to errors or incorrect behavior.
