The `median` is assigned the value of the element in `merged_list` at index `mid`. Since `merged_list` is sorted and its length is odd, `mid` will provide the index of the middle element. The previous states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is the sorted list of integers from `list1 + list2`, and the length of `merged_list` is an odd number; `mid` is equal to `(len(list1) + len(list2)) // 2`, `median` is equal to `merged_list[mid]`.**
