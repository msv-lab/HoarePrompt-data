The code assigns a value to `median`, which is calculated as the average of the middle two elements of `merged_list`. The variable `mid` is already defined as \((\text{len(list1)} + \text{len(list2)}) // 2\), and since the length of `merged_list` is even, this means there are two middle elements located at indices `mid - 1` and `mid`. Therefore, `median` will be the average of these two elements from `merged_list`.

The following variables will be affected:
- `median`: will be updated to the result of the calculation.

Other variables (`list1`, `list2`, `n`, `merged_list`, and `mid`) remain unchanged, with their properties still holding true as initially described.

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is the sorted list of integers from `list1 + list2`, `mid` is equal to `(len(list1) + len(list2)) // 2`, and `median` is equal to `(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`.**
