The variable `merged_list` is assigned the value of the sorted concatenation of `list1` and `list2`. Since both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers of the same size `n` (where `n` is a positive integer), the resulting `merged_list` will be a new list containing all the integers from both lists, arranged in ascending order. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is the sorted list of integers from `list1 + list2`.**
