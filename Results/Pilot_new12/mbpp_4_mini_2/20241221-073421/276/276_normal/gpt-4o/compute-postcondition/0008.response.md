The function `func_1` accepts parameters `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers and have the same size `n`, where `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns the median of the sorted merged list called `merged_list`, which is formed from the integers in `list1` and `list2`. If `merged_list` has an even length, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle numbers; if it has an odd length, the median is the middle number itself. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of integers of the same size and return the median of their merged and sorted combination.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, both of the same size `n`, and returns the median of the sorted merged list of integers from `list1` and `list2`.**
