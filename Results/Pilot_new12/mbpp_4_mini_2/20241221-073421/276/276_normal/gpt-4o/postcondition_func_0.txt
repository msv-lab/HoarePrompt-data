The function accepts two lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, which must both be of the same size `n` (where `n` is a positive integer). It merges these two lists, sorts the combined list, and calculates the median of the sorted list. If the combined sorted list has an even length, the median is computed as the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element itself. The function returns this median value. However, the function does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or where their lengths do not match, which could lead to errors or incorrect behavior.
