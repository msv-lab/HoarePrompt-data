Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer. Conversely, it returns `False` if `n` is an even integer. Since the input type is explicitly an integer, non-integer inputs are not handled, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such inputs are provided. The function directly performs a modulus operation to determine the parity of the number.**
