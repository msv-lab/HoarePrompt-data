#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer, and False if n is an even integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer. Conversely, it returns `False` if `n` is an even integer. Since the input type is explicitly an integer, non-integer inputs are not handled, which could lead to unexpected behavior if such inputs are provided. The function directly performs a modulus operation to determine the parity of the number.
