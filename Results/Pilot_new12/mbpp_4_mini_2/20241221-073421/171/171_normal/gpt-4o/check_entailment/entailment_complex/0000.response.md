Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description, which is to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(n)` is designed to return `True` if the integer `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. This aligns perfectly with the goal of finding whether the parity of a given number (which we understand to be odd in this context) meets the requirement specified in the problem statement.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The expression `n % 2 != 0` checks whether `n` is not divisible by 2. If `n` is odd, it will yield `True`; if `n` is even, it will yield `False`. This is the correct logical operation for determining the parity of the number.

3. **Assertions for Testing**: The assertions provided further validate the correctness of the function:
   - `func_1(12)` returns `False` (12 is even)
   - `func_1(7)` returns `True` (7 is odd)
   - `func_1(10)` returns `False` (10 is even)

   All assertions return the expected outcomes, confirming that the function behaves as anticipated for the tested inputs.

4. **Consideration of Input Types**: The annotations indicate that the function assumes `n` will always be an integer. Given the specified assumption that we will always receive valid inputs (integers), we do not need to handle any other types or edge cases (e.g., negative numbers or zeros), as they are not part of the problem statement.

In summary, since `func_1(n)` meets the requirements for determining if an integer's parity is odd and behaves correctly across all provided test cases, we conclude that the program is correct.
