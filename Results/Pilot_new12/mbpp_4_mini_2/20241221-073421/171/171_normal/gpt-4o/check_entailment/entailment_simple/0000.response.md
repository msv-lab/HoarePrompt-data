Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to determine whether the parity of the given integer `n` is odd. The implementation utilizes the expression `n % 2 != 0`, which evaluates to `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., when the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not zero) and `False` if `n` is even (i.e., when the remainder is zero).

The assertions provided further confirm the correctness of the function:
- `func_1(12)` evaluates to `False`, which is correct because `12` is an even number.
- `func_1(7)` evaluates to `True`, which is correct because `7` is an odd number.
- `func_1(10)` evaluates to `False`, which is correct because `10` is an even number.

Since the function meets the specification of determining whether a number is odd (returning `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers), the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description accurately.

Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
