Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(n)` correctly determines the parity of the given integer `n` by using the expression `n % 2 != 0`, which indeed returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. The provided assertions test the function against representative cases of both odd and even integers, producing the expected results. 

Additionally, the output hints clarify that the function accepts a valid integer parameter, and non-integer inputs are assumed not to occur, which means that the function's behavior with valid inputs is what matters in this context. Thus, there are no correctness issues with the logic or coverage of the provided tests in relation to the problem description. Therefore, the program successfully meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
