Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1(n)` is intended to determine if the parity of a given number `n` is odd. While it correctly returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, it does not handle any invalid input cases. Specifically, if the function is provided with a non-integer input (e.g., a string or a float), it would lead to a type error when performing the modulus operation. Since the problem description does not specify that the input will always be a valid integer and does not account for potential invalid inputs, the function does not satisfy the completeness of the problem requirements. 

For example, calling `func_1("7")` would result in a TypeError, confirming that the function does not correctly address all potential cases as required by the problem description.
