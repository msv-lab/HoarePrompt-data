Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to determine the parity of a number, returning `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. However, the function `func_1` is not designed to handle input cases beyond standard integers. Although the problem description only specifies working with integers, if at least one unexpected input is tested, the program could potentially fail. 

For example, if a non-integer input, such as a string or float, were to be passed to `func_1`, the modulus operation (`n % 2`) would raise a `TypeError`, leading to unexpected behavior. The output hints indicate that non-integer inputs are not handled. So, while the function correctly implements the logic for integers as described, the lack of handling for potential input cases results in an incorrect implementation according to the stipulated requirements.

Therefore, the program does not meet the robustness expected in this context, as it does not work correctly for every potential case.
