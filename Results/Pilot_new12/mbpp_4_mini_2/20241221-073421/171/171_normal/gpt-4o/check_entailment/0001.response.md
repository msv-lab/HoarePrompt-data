Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of the number `n` is odd by evaluating `n % 2 != 0`. This condition correctly returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. 

The assertions given in the program are as follows:
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True`, which is correct as 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False`, which is also correct because 10 is even.

Since the logic of checking whether a number is odd using the modulo operator `%` is sound, and the assertions cover representative cases of both odd and even numbers, the program satisfies the requirements of the problem description. There are no missing cases or logic in the program for odd and even number checks.
