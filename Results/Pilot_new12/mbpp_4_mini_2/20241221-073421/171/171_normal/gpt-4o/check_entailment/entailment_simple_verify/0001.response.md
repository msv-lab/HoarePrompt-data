Final: **True**

The program is correct as it meets the problem description of determining whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` correctly identifies odd numbers by returning `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, as verified by the annotations. The assertions provided in the original code accurately test the function against both odd and even numbers, validating the correctness of the implementation. 

Additionally, the annotated version clarifies that the function behaves as intended by stating that it returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description, which seeks to determine the oddity of an integer.

Therefore, the original assessment of correctness is accurate, and the program functions as expected based on the criteria laid out in the problem description.
