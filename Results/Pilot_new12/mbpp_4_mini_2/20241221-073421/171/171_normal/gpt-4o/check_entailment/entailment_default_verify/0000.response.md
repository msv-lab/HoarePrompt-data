Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the logic for determining the parity of an integer. The function uses the modulus operator to check whether the input number `n` is odd (returns `True`) or even (returns `False`). 

The provided assertions validate the correctness of the implementation:

- `func_1(12)` correctly returns `False` for the even number 12.
- `func_1(7)` correctly returns `True` for the odd number 7.
- `func_1(10)` correctly returns `False` for the even number 10.

The output hints clarify that the function is explicitly intended for integers and describes the expected behavior regarding odd and even numbers, which aligns with the problem description. Although the function does not handle non-integer inputs, the problem context assumes valid integer inputs, thus not affecting the function's correctness in the given scenario.

Overall, all evidence aligns with the assessment that the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
