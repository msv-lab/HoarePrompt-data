Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1(n)` accurately checks the parity of a number, returning `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. The annotated version reinforces this conclusion by noting that the function design explicitly handles the calculation of whether `n` is odd or even using a modulus operation. 

The assertions included in the program serve to verify the correctness of the function against specific test cases—12 (even), 7 (odd), and 10 (even)—demonstrating that the function behaves as expected. The program's assumption of valid integer input further supports its correctness under the stated problem description.

While the annotated code acknowledges that non-integer inputs could lead to unexpected behavior, it is stated that we can assume valid inputs will be provided, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.

Thus, based on the annotations and reasoning presented, the conclusion is that the program is indeed correct.
