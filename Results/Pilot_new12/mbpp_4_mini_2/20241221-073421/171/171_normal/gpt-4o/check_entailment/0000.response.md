Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly determines if the parity of a given number is odd. It uses the modulus operator `%` to check if the number is not divisible by 2, indicating that it is odd. The assertions provided test the function against multiple cases (12, 7, and 10), and for each case, the function produces the expected result:

- For `n = 12`: even number, so `func_1(12)` returns `False`.
- For `n = 7`: odd number, so `func_1(7)` returns `True`.
- For `n = 10`: even number, so `func_1(10)` returns `False`.

Since the function behaves correctly for all tested inputs and follows the problem description accurately, it can be concluded that the implementation is correct. There are no edge cases or unintended scenarios that cause it to fail, thus confirming its correctness.
