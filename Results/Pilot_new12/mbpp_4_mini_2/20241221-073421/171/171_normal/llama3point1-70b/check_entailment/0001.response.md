Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the number `n` is odd (i.e., when `n % 2 != 0`) and `False` otherwise. 

To validate this, we can consider a range of integer inputs:
- For `n = 1`, the function returns `True` (1 is odd).
- For `n = 2`, the function returns `False` (2 is even).
- For `n = -1`, the function returns `True` (-1 is odd).
- For `n = -2`, the function returns `False` (-2 is even).
- For `n = 0`, the function returns `False` (0 is even).

The function behaves correctly for both positive, negative, and zero values. Since no potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the implementation is correct.
