Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to determine whether the parity of a given integer `n` is odd. 

**Explanation:**
- The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and checks if `n % 2 != 0`. This expression evaluates to `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., the remainder when `n` is divided by 2 is not equal to 0), and `False` if `n` is even (i.e., the remainder is 0).
- The annotated comments provide a clear understanding of what the function is doing, confirming that it accurately identifies odd and even integers.
- The program adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description, which specifies a need to find out if a given number is odd. 

Therefore, since it meets the requirements of the problem description, we conclude that the program is correct.
