Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The logic used in the function effectively employs the modulo operator to determine if the integer `n` is odd or even, returning `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. 

The original assessment's conclusion of correctness takes into account that the function outputs the correct boolean values across various cases, including positive, negative, and zero values. The function will indeed return `True` for odd inputs such as 1 and -1, and `False` for even inputs like 2 and 0, which confirms it meets the described specifications.

While the output hints mention that the function does not handle non-integer input specifically, this is aligned with the assumption that valid integer input will be provided, thus not impacting its correctness regarding the problem description. Given that the function performs correctly for all valid integer inputs, the original assessment remains accurate.
