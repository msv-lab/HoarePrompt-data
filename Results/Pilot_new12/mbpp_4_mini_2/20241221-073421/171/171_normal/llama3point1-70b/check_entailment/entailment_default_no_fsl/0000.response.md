Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly determines the parity of an integer `n` by using the expression `n % 2 != 0`. This expression will return `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, which aligns with the problem description. The output hints agree with this functionality, stating that the function will accurately return whether `n` is odd or even.

Since the task assumes that the input will be valid and integer-type, cases involving non-integer inputs (negative integers, etc.) do not affect the correctness. The function adheres to the expected behavior for any integer input â€“ it will provide a reliable boolean output indicating parity.

Given that the function meets the problem's requirements for all valid integer cases, the conclusion of correctness holds.
