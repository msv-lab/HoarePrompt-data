Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly concludes that the program is correct. The function `func_1(n)` accurately determines whether the parity of the given integer `n` is odd by utilizing the modulo operator. The annotations confirm that the function returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, which aligns with the problem description that specifies the task is to check for odd parity. The program handles various cases appropriately, including negative integers and zero, and the precondition that `n` is an integer is explicitly stated, reinforcing that the program is designed to function correctly within the defined constraints. Therefore, the original assessment remains justified in affirming the program's correctness.
