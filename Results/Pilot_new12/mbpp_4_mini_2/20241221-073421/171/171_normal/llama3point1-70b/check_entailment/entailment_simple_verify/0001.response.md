Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program meets the problem description, which requires determining whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` correctly implements this logic by returning `True` for odd integers (when `n % 2 != 0`) and `False` for even integers. 

The provided annotated version of the code supports this conclusion, clarifying that right before the function call, `n` is indeed an integer and detailing the logic of the return statement. The function has been tested against various integers (positive, negative, and zero) which confirms that it behaves correctly in all cases as described in the original assessment.

Since the implementation does not need to handle invalid input cases and functions as expected for valid inputs, the conclusion of correctness stands. Thus, the assessment is validated.
