Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. The function uses the modulo operator to check if `n` is not divisible by 2, returning `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers. This functionality comprehensively covers all cases, including negative numbers and zero:

- For `n = 1`, the output is `True` (odd).
- For `n = 2`, the output is `False` (even).
- For `n = -1`, the output is `True` (odd).
- For `n = 0`, the output is `False` (even).

Since no edge cases or scenarios lead to incorrect output, the code meets the requirement outlined in the problem description.
