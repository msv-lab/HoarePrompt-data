Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly defines a function `func_1(n)` that checks the parity of the integer `n`. According to the problem description, the function should determine whether the parity of `n` is odd. 

In the function, the expression `n % 2 != 0` evaluates to `True` when `n` is an odd integer (because odd numbers have a remainder of 1 when divided by 2) and evaluates to `False` when `n` is an even integer (because even numbers have a remainder of 0). 

This logic aligns perfectly with the requirement of the problem description where it specifically states the function must find out if the parity of `n` is odd. Therefore, the function behaves as expected and accomplishes the task described in the problem statement. 

In summary, the function meets the specified requirement, validating the correctness of the implementation.
