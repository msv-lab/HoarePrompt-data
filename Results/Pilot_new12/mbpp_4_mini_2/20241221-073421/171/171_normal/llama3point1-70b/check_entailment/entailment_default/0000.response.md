The code provided is a function designed to determine the parity of a given integer. It correctly returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers by utilizing the modulus operator:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
```

The output hints explain that the function accepts an integer and determines whether it is odd or even. It correctly identifies odd numbers by checking if `n % 2 != 0`.

Examining the problem description and the output hints, we see that the function properly addresses the core functionality of detecting odd integers for any integer input provided, as noted in the output hints: it produces a boolean output for any integer (including negative integers and very large integers), satisfying the function's requirement.

However, the output hints mention that the function does not handle non-integer inputs or specific edge cases such as negative integers. While it's noted that it will produce a boolean output for any integer, the code does not specify any handling for non-integer types if, hypothetically, such input were provided. 

According to the problem description, since we assume that the input will always be a valid integer, the function works correctly as intended for all valid integer inputs. Therefore, there are no cases discovered in the provided specifications where the function would fail, given valid integer input.

Thus, based on this analysis, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
