Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer parameter `n` and determines whether it is an odd or even integer. It returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and returns `False` if `n` is an even integer. The function does not handle non-integer inputs or edge cases such as negative integers or very large integers specifically, but it will still produce a boolean output for any integer provided. In conclusion, the function reliably identifies and returns the parity of the integer `n`.**
