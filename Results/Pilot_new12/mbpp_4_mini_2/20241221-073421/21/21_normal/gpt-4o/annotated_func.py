#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the smallest integer from the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It returns the smallest integer from that list. However, the function does not handle edge cases such as an empty list, which would raise a `ValueError` when attempting to find the minimum. Therefore, if `lst` is empty, the function does not return a valid result and would instead raise an exception, indicating a potential oversight in the implementation regarding input validation.
