Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(lst)` utilizes Python's built-in `min` function, which operates correctly for the task of finding the smallest number in a list of integers. The annotations confirm that the input is a list of integers, and the function successfully returns the minimum value as expected.

The assertions provided validate the function's behavior with different inputs, all yielding the correct smallest values. Therefore, the program meets the problem description's requirements, and there are no indications from the annotated version that would suggest otherwise. The reasoning presented in the original assessment holds true, reinforcing the correctness of this implementation.
