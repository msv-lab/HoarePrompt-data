Based on the provided problem description, the program's purpose is to find the smallest number in a list. The function `func_1` correctly utilizes the built-in `min` function to achieve this for a given list of integers. 

The original assessment stated that the correctness was **True**, which is justified by the assertions confirming the expected behavior of `func_1` with various inputs. 

In the annotated version of the code, it is clearly stated that right before the function call, `lst` is indeed a list of integers. Furthermore, the annotation clarifies that the function returns the smallest integer from the list 'lst', which aligns with the problem description.

Even though the original assessment pointed out that the function does not handle an empty list, it also noted that the current problem context assumes valid input. Given that the use case explicitly assumes that input will always be valid and that the program fulfills the requirement of finding the smallest number from a provided list of integers, the failure to handle an empty list becomes irrelevant in this scenario.

Therefore, the original assessment correctly deemed the program to have logical correctness for the specified use cases, and after considering the annotations, I find no justification to alter that judgment.

Final: **True**
