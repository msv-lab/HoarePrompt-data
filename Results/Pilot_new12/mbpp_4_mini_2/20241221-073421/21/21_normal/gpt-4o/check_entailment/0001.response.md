Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that correctly uses the `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves correctly for the tested cases. 

To further analyze the correctness, consider other potential edge cases:

1. **Empty List**: Calling `func_1([])` would raise a `ValueError` since the `min` function cannot operate on an empty sequence.
2. **Single Element List**: Calling `func_1([5])` correctly returns `5`, which is valid.
3. **Negative Numbers**: Calling `func_1([-3, -2, -1])` would correctly return `-3`, which is valid.
4. **Mixed Numbers**: Calling `func_1([0, -1, 1])` would correctly return `-1`, which is valid.

While the function works correctly for various types of valid input, the failure to handle an empty list is a significant oversight. 

Therefore, because it does not handle this case, the overall conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails when provided with an empty list, as it does not return a value nor handles the exception properly.
