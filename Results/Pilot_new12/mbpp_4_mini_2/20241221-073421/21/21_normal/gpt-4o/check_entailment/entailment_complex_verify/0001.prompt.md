You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that correctly uses the `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves correctly for the tested cases. 

To further analyze the correctness, consider other potential edge cases:

1. **Empty List**: Calling `func_1([])` would raise a `ValueError` since the `min` function cannot operate on an empty sequence.
2. **Single Element List**: Calling `func_1([5])` correctly returns `5`, which is valid.
3. **Negative Numbers**: Calling `func_1([-3, -2, -1])` would correctly return `-3`, which is valid.
4. **Mixed Numbers**: Calling `func_1([0, -1, 1])` would correctly return `-1`, which is valid.

While the function works correctly for various types of valid input, the failure to handle an empty list is a significant oversight. 

Therefore, because it does not handle this case, the overall conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails when provided with an empty list, as it does not return a value nor handles the exception properly.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99]) == 1
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 1
assert func_1([45, 46, 50, 60]) == 45

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return min(lst)
    #The program returns the smallest integer from the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It returns the smallest integer from that list. However, the function does not handle edge cases such as an empty list, which would raise a `ValueError` when attempting to find the minimum. Therefore, if `lst` is empty, the function does not return a valid result and would instead raise an exception, indicating a potential oversight in the implementation regarding input validation.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
