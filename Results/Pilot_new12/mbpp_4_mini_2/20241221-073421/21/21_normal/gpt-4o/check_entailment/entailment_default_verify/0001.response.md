Final: **False**

The original assessment stated that the program was correct based on the use of the `min` function and the provided assertions. However, the output hints clearly indicate that the function does not handle the case of an empty list, which leads to a `ValueError`. This oversight is significant and impacts the overall correctness of the program, as the expectation of handling all possible input cases is standard in robust function design. As a result, the program fails to meet the problem description adequately due to its inability to handle an empty list, warranting a final correctness assessment of **False**.
