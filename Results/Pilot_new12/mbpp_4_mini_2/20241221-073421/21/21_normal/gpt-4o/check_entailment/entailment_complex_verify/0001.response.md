Final: **False**

The original assessment indicated the program's correctness as **True**, but upon closer examination with the annotated code, it's clear that while the function `func_1` correctly finds the smallest number in a list of integers, it does not handle the edge case of an empty list. When an empty list is passed as input, the function would raise a `ValueError`, which demonstrates that the function does not meet the requirement of returning a valid result for every valid input. The annotations have pointed out the lack of handling for edge cases, suggesting a significant oversight in the implementation, which validates this conclusion. Therefore, the program is not fully correct due to this limitation.
