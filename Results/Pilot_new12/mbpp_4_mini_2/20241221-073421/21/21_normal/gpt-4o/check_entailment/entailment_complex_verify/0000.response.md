Final: **False**

While the logic of the function `func_1(lst)` is correctly implemented in terms of using Python's built-in `min` function to find the smallest integer in a list, the annotated version highlights a critical oversight: the function does not handle the case of an empty list. If an empty list is input, `min(lst)` would raise a `ValueError`.

The original assessment did not take this potential error into account, leading to the conclusion of correctness without acknowledging this important aspect of input validation. Consequently, since the program does not guarantee a valid operation under all specified input conditions (i.e., when an empty list is passed), it cannot be deemed fully correct according to the problem requirements. Hence, the conclusion must be adjusted to reflect this limitation.
