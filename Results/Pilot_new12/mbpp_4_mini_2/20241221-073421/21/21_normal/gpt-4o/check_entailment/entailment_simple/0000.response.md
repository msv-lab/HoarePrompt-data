Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the smallest number in a list. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and uses Python's built-in `min()` function to return the smallest integer from that list.

- The assertions provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases:
  - For the input `[10, 20, 1, 45, 99]`, the smallest number is `1`.
  - For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the smallest number is `1`.
  - For the input `[45, 46, 50, 60]`, the smallest number is `45`.

The function fulfills the requirement of identifying the smallest number in any list of integers properly and efficiently. Since we are assuming the input will always be valid (as stated), there are no additional cases to consider for invalid inputs such as empty lists or non-integer values. This means the program adheres to the problem description for all the expected inputs. Thus, the correctness check returns "True".
