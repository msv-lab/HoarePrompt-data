Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the logic to find the smallest number in a list by using Python's built-in `min` function, which returns the minimum value from the provided iterable. 

All the assertions provided have valid input cases and they all return the expected smallest values:
- For the input `[10, 20, 1, 45, 99]`, the smallest number is `1`.
- For the input `[1, 2, 3]`, the smallest number is `1`.
- For the input `[45, 46, 50, 60]`, the smallest number is `45`.

Additionally, since no edge cases or invalid scenarios are presented in the assertions, the function appears to operate correctly for any list of numbers, including handling cases with negative numbers, zeros, or duplicates. Therefore, given the requirements of the problem description and the correctness of the provided code, I conclude that it is correct.
