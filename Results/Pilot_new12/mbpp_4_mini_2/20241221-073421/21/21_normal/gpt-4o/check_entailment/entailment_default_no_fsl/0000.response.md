Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the edge case of an empty list. According to the provided problem description, the function is expected to find the smallest number in a list. However, if the input list `lst` is empty, calling `min(lst)` will raise a `ValueError`. This indicates that the function does not return a valid result for every potential case, specifically when the input is an empty list, which is a significant oversight. 

Therefore, since the program fails to handle this case, it does not meet the requirement of the problem description for all possible inputs.
