Correctness: **True**.

The program uses Python's built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function works correctly for all valid input cases, including:

1. A list containing various integers and/or floats.
2. An empty list, which will raise a `ValueError`, but the problem statement does not clarify the expected behavior for such inputs.
3. A list with a single element, where that single element is correctly returned.

Since no input case is provided in the problem description regarding handling empty lists, and since the `min()` function works correctly for all other listed scenarios, the program fulfills the requirements as per the stated problem description.
