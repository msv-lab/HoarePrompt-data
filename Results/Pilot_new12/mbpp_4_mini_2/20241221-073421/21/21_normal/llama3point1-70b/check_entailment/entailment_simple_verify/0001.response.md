The original assessment highlighted that the program would raise a `ValueError` when called with an empty list, which is true. However, the provided annotations state that "nums is a list of numbers," indicating an assumption that the input will be valid and not empty.

Given the problem description only asks for a function to find the smallest number in a list and does not specify how to handle an empty list, and considering the annotations suggest that valid input will be provided, we can infer that the focus on correctness should relax the requirement to handle empty input cases.

The function does indeed return the smallest number from a valid input list, and assuming the inputs are valid aligns with the program's expectations. Therefore, the issue pointed out in the original assessment is based on an assumption of potential use cases that were not specified.

Taking all of this into consideration, I believe the original assessment is overly strict. The function is correct given the assumptions outlined in the problem description and the annotated code.

Final: **True**
