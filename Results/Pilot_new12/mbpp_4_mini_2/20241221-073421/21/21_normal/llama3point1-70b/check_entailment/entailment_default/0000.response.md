Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The provided function uses Python's built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in the list `nums`. However, it does not handle the case when the list is empty. If an empty list is passed, the `min` function will raise a `ValueError`, which means the function does not fulfill the problem description under all potential cases, specifically when handling an empty list. Therefore, the implementation fails for at least one scenario, making it incorrect.
