Correctness: **False**

The Python program provided does not handle the case where the input list `nums` is empty. If the function `func_1` is called with an empty list, it will raise a `ValueError` because the `min()` function cannot operate on an empty sequence. Since the problem description does not mention how to handle an empty list and the program fails for that case, the implementation is incorrect.
