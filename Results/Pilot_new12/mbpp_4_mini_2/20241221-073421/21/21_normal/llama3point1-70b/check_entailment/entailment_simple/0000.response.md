Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the smallest number in a list. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers as input and uses Python's built-in `min()` function to return the smallest number from that list.

Since we assume that the input will always be valid and follow the specified requirements (i.e., a non-empty list of numbers), the program will always correctly output the smallest number. There are no edge cases presented in the problem description that the program would fail to handle, hence it meets the criteria given in the problem statement.
