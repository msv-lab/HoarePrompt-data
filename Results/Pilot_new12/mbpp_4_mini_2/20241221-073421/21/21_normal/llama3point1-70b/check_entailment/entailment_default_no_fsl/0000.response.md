Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list `nums` is empty. As noted in the output hints, calling `min()` on an empty list raises a `ValueError`. Since the program does not meet the problem description's requirement for every potential case — specifically when `nums` is empty — it cannot be considered correct. An example of this incorrect behavior is when calling `func_1([])`, which will result in an error instead of returning a smallest number.
