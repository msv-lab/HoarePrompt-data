#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of numbers.
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)
    #The program returns the smallest number from the list 'nums'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of numbers. It returns the smallest number from that list. However, it does not handle the case where `nums` is empty, which would raise a `ValueError`. Therefore, the final state of the program after its execution is that it provides the smallest number in `nums` if the list is not empty; otherwise, it will result in an error if the input list is empty.
