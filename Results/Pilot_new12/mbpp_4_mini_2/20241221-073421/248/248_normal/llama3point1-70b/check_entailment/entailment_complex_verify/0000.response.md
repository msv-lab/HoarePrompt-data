Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description of converting a list to a tuple. The annotations further support this conclusion by confirming that `func_1` takes a list (`input_list`) and returns a tuple containing the same elements, including handling the edge case of an empty list by returning an empty tuple. The recognition that the function assumes valid input (a list) aligns with the conditions stated in the problem description and the original assessment. The functionâ€™s lack of input validation does not detract from its correctness given the assumption of valid input. Thus, the program behaves as expected and satisfies the requirements outlined.
