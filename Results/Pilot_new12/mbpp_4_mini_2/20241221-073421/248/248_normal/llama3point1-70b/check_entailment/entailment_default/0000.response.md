Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly converts any given list into a tuple as required by the problem description. It handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty tuple, which is the expected behavior. Given that the function does not need to validate the input (as per the assumptions made) and will raise an error if provided with a non-list input, it meets the requirements stated in the description for valid inputs. Hence, it correctly fulfills the conversion task for all valid cases.
