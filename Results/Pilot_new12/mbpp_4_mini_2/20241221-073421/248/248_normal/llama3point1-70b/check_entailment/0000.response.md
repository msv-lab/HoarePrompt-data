Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` clearly meets the problem description to convert a list to a tuple. The function takes a single argument `input_list` and utilizes the built-in `tuple()` function to convert that list into a tuple. Since the conversion process is straightforward and handles any standard list provided, including empty lists, the function behaves as expected across all cases.

For example:
- For `func_1([1, 2, 3])`, it correctly returns `(1, 2, 3)`.
- For `func_1([])`, it correctly returns `()`.
- For `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'])`, it correctly returns `('a', 'b', 'c')`.

The function handles lists with different types of elements as well, including mixed types. Thus, there are no edge cases that the program does not handle correctly, confirming its correctness.
