Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which asks for a function to convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes a parameter `input_list`, which is assumed to be a valid list. The function uses the built-in `tuple()` constructor to convert this list into a tuple and returns the resulting tuple.

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:
1. It correctly receives a list as input.
2. It effectively converts the list to a tuple by using the `tuple()` function.
3. The return value is indeed a tuple containing the same elements as those in the provided list.

Since the problem description clearly states that the function must convert a list to a tuple without any additional constraints or edge cases that we need to consider (as we assume valid input), the program functions as intended. Thus, it correctly fulfills its purpose as specified in the problem description.
