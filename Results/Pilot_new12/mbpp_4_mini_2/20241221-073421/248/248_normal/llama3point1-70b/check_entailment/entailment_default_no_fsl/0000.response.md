Correctness: **False**

The program `func_1` is intended to convert a list to a tuple. While it does fulfill the basic functionality of transforming a list into a tuple correctly, the output hints indicate that the function does not perform any validation on the input type. Specifically, it states that if provided with invalid types (such as a non-list), it would raise a `TypeError`. 

According to the problem description, we are to assume valid input will be provided. However, since the hints highlight that the function will raise an error if given a non-list type and no thorough validation is included, the program does not necessarily handle every potential case correctly. 

For instance, if `func_1` is called with an integer or a string instead of a list, it will fail. As such, we cannot guarantee correctness across every potential input case.

Thus, the function fails to meet the criteria for correctness due to its inability to handle invalid input types without resulting in errors.
