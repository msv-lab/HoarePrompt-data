Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to convert a list to a tuple. 

### Explanation:
- The function is defined to take an input parameter `input_list`, which is stated to be a list of elements that can be of any data type. 
- The function uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list into a tuple and returns it. This directly fulfills the requirement of the problem description.
- An edge case of an empty list is also handled correctly: if `input_list` is empty, `tuple(input_list)` will return an empty tuple `()`, which is the expected behavior.
- The annotations clarify that the function does not perform validation or checks on the input list. However, it is specified that the input will be valid (a list), so there is no concern about error handling for invalid types. 

Thus, the program successfully implements the functionality required by the problem description without any issues.
