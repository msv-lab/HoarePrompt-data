Final: **True** 

The original assessment stating that the program is correct is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality of converting a list to a tuple as per the problem description. The assessment also appropriately considers various scenarios, such as handling an empty list and lists with mixed types. While the output hints mention that the function does not validate the input and could raise a `TypeError` for non-list inputs, the problem description assumes valid input will be provided. Given these constraints, the function fulfills its intended purpose effectively, thus confirming the correctness of the implementation.
