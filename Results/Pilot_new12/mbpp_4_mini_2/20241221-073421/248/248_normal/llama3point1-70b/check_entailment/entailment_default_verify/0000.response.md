Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` takes a list as an input and correctly converts it into a tuple, which meets the problem description. The output hints corroborate this by noting that the function handles both empty lists (returning an empty tuple) and lists containing elements of any data type. Although the function does not include input validation for cases where the input is not a list, the problem statement assumes valid input, and thus this does not affect the correctness. Overall, the function performs its intended task as expected across different scenarios, confirming its correctness.
