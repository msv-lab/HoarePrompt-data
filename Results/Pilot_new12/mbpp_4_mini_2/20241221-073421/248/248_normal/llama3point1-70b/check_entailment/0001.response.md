Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes an input list and converts it to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function. This is the expected functionality as per the problem description, which calls for a conversion from a list to a tuple.

The code handles various potential cases:
- If `input_list` is an empty list `[]`, the result will be an empty tuple `()`.
- If `input_list` contains a mix of types (like integers, strings, etc.), the function will correctly convert it to a tuple with those elements.
- If `input_list` contains nested lists, the function will convert those into tuples as well, since the `tuple()` function works for all list types.

Since all possible inputs conforming to a list will yield a valid tuple as output, there are no edge cases that the function does not account for. Thus, the implementation is correct.
