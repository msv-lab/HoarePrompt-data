The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `input_list`, which is a list of elements that can be of any data type. It converts this list into a tuple and returns it. An edge case to consider is if `input_list` is empty, in which case it will return an empty tuple. The function does not perform any validation on the input list, so if provided with invalid types (such as a non-list), it would raise a `TypeError`. Overall, it simply transforms the input list into a tuple without any additional checks or enhancements.
