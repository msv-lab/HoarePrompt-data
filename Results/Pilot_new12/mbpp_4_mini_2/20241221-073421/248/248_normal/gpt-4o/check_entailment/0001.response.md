Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function to convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the same elements. The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that the function works as intended for various cases, returning the expected tuple each time.

I can think of potential edge cases, such as:

1. An empty list `[]` which should return an empty tuple `()`.
2. A list containing mixed types, like `[1, 'a', 3.1]`, which should return `(1, 'a', 3.1)`.
3. A list with nested lists, like `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`, which should return `([1, 2], [3, 4])`.

The function works as expected for all these cases. The conversion from a list to a tuple using the `tuple()` function is handled properly and consistently. Thus, the program is correct.
