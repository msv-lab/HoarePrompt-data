Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately reflects the program's correctness based on the problem description, which specifies that the function should convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` uses Python's built-in `tuple()` function to accomplish this, which is appropriate for the task.

The provided assertions in both the program and the annotated code demonstrate that the function correctly converts several different valid lists into tuples. The annotations confirm that prior to the function call, `lst` is indeed a list of elements, and the output is a tuple containing the elements of that list. Given that all assertions pass without error, the function meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Therefore, the final assessment is maintained as correct.
