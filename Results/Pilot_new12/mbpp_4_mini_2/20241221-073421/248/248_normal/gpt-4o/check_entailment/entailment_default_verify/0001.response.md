Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion of a list to a tuple, as required by the problem description. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for various test cases, including cases with non-empty lists. 

Additionally, according to the output hints, the function properly returns an empty tuple when given an empty list, which adheres to the expected behavior stated in the problem description. The claims in the original assessment regarding potential edge cases are also consistent with the function's functionality, as it correctly handles lists of mixed types and nested lists.

Therefore, given the evidenced functionality in the code and the provided output hints, the program meets the required specifications, and the correctness of the original assessment stands.
