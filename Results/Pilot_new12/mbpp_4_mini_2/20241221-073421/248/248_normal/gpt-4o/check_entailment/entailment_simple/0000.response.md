Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(lst)` converts a list into a tuple by using the built-in `tuple()` function, which is the appropriate method to achieve this task.

Here's a breakdown explaining why the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input**: The function takes a single argument, `lst`, which is expected to be a list. The problem description states that the function must convert a list to a tuple.
   
2. **Processing**: Inside the function, the expression `tuple(lst)` is executed. The `tuple()` function is specifically designed to convert an iterable (in this case, the list) into a tuple.

3. **Output**: The function returns the tuple representation of the list. The assertions provided as test cases confirm that the output is correct for various list inputs.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The problem statement assumes valid inputs only, meaning it doesn't consider empty lists or non-list inputs. Since the correctness is evaluated based on valid inputs, and there are no edge cases in the provided tests undermining this assumption, the function is deemed correct.

Therefore, it consistently performs the required operation as specified in the problem description.
