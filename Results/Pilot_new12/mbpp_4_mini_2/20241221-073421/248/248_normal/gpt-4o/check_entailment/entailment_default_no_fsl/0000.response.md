Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and accurately converts it to a tuple. The provided assertions confirm that the function works for several test cases, including converting lists of varying lengths (including an empty list, which would return an empty tuple).

Since the problem statement assumes valid inputs (lists) will always be provided and the code does not handle exceptions or type checks, this is within the requirements set by the description. As long as the input is a valid list, the function will behave as expected for all potential cases specified, including returning an empty tuple for an empty list.

Given the output hints and parity with the function's behavior, we can conclude that the function is indeed correct in its current form.
