Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly converts a list of elements into a tuple as specified in the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function returns a tuple containing all elements from the input list, which includes handling an empty list correctly by returning an empty tuple. Since the function processes only lists and does not require additional type checks (as we are assuming valid input), it meets the requirements stated in the problem description for every potential case presented. The examples also validate that the function behaves correctly for non-empty lists. Therefore, the program is correct in fulfilling the provided task.
