Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` does perform the intended task of converting a list to a tuple, and the provided assertion tests confirm that it handles multiple test cases successfully, including different lengths and values of lists. The output hints reinforce that the function correctly returns an empty tuple when given an empty list and confirms that the function assumes the input will be valid and does not perform unnecessary checks that would alter its primary functionality. Hence, the program meets the requirement laid out in the problem description, validating the original assessment.
