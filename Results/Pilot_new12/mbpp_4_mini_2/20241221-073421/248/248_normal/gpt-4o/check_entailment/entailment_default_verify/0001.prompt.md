You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a list to a tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1([5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3]) == (5, 10, 7, 4, 15, 3)
assert func_1([2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7]) == (2, 4, 5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 4, 7)
assert func_1([58, 44, 56]) == (58, 44, 56)

def func_1(lst):
    return tuple(lst)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function to convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the same elements. The assertions provided in the program demonstrate that the function works as intended for various cases, returning the expected tuple each time.

I can think of potential edge cases, such as:

1. An empty list `[]` which should return an empty tuple `()`.
2. A list containing mixed types, like `[1, 'a', 3.1]`, which should return `(1, 'a', 3.1)`.
3. A list with nested lists, like `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]`, which should return `([1, 2], [3, 4])`.

The function works as expected for all these cases. The conversion from a list to a tuple using the `tuple()` function is handled properly and consistently. Thus, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements, and returns a tuple containing all the elements of `lst`. If `lst` is empty, the function will return an empty tuple. The function does not perform any type checks or handle exceptions related to input types; it assumes that the input is a list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
