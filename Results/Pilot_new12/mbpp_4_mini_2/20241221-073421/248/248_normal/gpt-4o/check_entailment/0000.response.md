Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The assertion tests provided in the program cover various cases, including different lengths and values of the list, and all pass without error. Since the function creates a tuple using Python's built-in `tuple()` constructor, it handles all possible list inputs correctly. Therefore, I cannot think of any input or edge case where the function would fail to meet the problem description.
