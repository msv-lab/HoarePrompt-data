The program correctly implements the function `func_1`, which converts a list to a tuple. The assertion tests provided confirm that the function behaves as expected for various lists, including different lengths and values, and all assertions pass without error. The annotated version of the code clearly states that the function accepts a list (`lst`) and returns a tuple of its elements, which aligns with the problem description that asks for a function to convert a list to a tuple.

The remarks in the annotated version regarding the function's operation and the assumption of valid input do not introduce any discrepancies with the original assessment. It accurately confirms that the function behaves correctly according to the given problem, as all expected cases are covered by the assertions.

Thus, the original assessment declaring the correctness of the program is upheld.

Final: **True**
