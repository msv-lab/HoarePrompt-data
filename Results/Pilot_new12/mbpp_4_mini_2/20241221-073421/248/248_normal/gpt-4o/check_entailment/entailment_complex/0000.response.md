Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description, which states that a function must be implemented to convert a list to a tuple. Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Function Implementation**: The `func_1` function is defined to take one parameter, `lst`, which is expected to be a list. The function correctly uses the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list to a tuple.

2. **Return Value**: It returns a tuple containing all the elements of the list `lst`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which specifies that the output should be a tuple made from the list elements.

3. **Handling of Empty List**: The function correctly handles the case of an empty list by returning an empty tuple `()` as there are no elements to convert.

4. **Assumptions About Input Validity**: The annotations indicate the assumption that the input will always be valid (a list), meaning there is no expectation to handle invalid input cases like non-list types. This aligns with the problem description's requirements.

5. **Assertions**: The assertions provided in the annotated program further confirm that the function performs as intended, producing the correct outputs for a variety of list inputs.

Since the function operates correctly according to the specified requirements in the problem statement for all valid inputs that it is assumed to receive, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
