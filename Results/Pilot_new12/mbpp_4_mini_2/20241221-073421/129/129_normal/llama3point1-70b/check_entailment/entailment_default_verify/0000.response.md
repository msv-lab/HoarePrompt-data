Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the requirement to find the ASCII value of a character by using the built-in `ord()` function in Python. The function `func_1` is designed to accept a single character string `char` and appropriately returns its ASCII value as an integer.

The output hints confirm that the function returns values as expected when the input is valid. Furthermore, it clarifies that the function assumes the input will be a valid single character string, which aligns with the original problem description. The assessment correctly notes that while the function does not handle cases where the input might be invalid (such as non-single character strings or empty strings), it is designed under the assumption that input will meet the specified requirements. Therefore, since the program fulfills its intended functionality as described, the final assessment remains true.
