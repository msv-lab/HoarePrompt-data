Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function accurately returns the ASCII value of a single character using the `ord()` function. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string or is empty, which could lead to an error when these invalid inputs are used. According to the problem description, we need a function that works for every potential case, including ensuring that the input is strictly a non-empty string of one character. Since this program does not fulfill that requirement and lacks error handling for such cases, it is deemed incorrect.
