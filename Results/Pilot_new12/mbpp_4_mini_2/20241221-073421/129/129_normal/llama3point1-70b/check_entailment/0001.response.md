Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input string `char` is not a single character. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to get the ASCII value of "a single character," but the program does not enforce that the input `char` is exactly one character long. 

For example, if the input is an empty string `""`, or a multi-character string like `"ab"`, the `ord()` function will still attempt to return an ASCII value, which will lead to unexpected behavior or errors.

Thus, since the program does not correctly implement the requirement to accept only a single character, its correctness is false.
