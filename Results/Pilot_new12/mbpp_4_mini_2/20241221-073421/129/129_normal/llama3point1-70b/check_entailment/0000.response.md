Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a single character (of type `str`) as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. There are no edge cases where this would fail, as it explicitly returns the ASCII value only for a single character. If a non-single character string or an empty string is passed, Python's `ord()` function will raise a `TypeError` or `IndexError`, but according to the problem description, it is assumed that the input is a valid single character as specified. Thus, the function behaves correctly for every expected case based on the provided requirements.
