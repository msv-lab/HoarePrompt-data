Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirement to find the ASCII value of a character as described in the problem description. 

Here are the reasons why it meets the problem description:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to accept a single character string, as specified in the annotations.
  
2. **Correct Implementation**: The use of the `ord()` function is appropriate. The `ord()` function takes a single character (which is a string of length 1) and returns its ASCII value as an integer. This directly fulfills the task of finding the ASCII value of the character.

3. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The annotations state that the function assumes valid input. The problem description also does not specify how to handle invalid inputs. Since it is assumed that the input will always be a valid, non-empty single character string, the implementation correctly operates under this constraint. Thus, any potential errors from invalid input (like an empty string or a multi-character string) are not a concern under the given assumptions.

Overall, the function's behavior aligns with the task requirement, and it correctly computes the ASCII value for a valid character input.
