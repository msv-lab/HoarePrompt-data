You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
def func_1(char: str) -> int:
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a single character (of type `str`) as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. There are no edge cases where this would fail, as it explicitly returns the ASCII value only for a single character. If a non-single character string or an empty string is passed, Python's `ord()` function will raise a `TypeError` or `IndexError`, but according to the problem description, it is assumed that the input is a valid single character as specified. Thus, the function behaves correctly for every expected case based on the provided requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value as an integer using the `ord()` function. It does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string or is empty, which could result in an error. The function assumes that the input will always be valid, specifically a non-empty string containing exactly one character.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
