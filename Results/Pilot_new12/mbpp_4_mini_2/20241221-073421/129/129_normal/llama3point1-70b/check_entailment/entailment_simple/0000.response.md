Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements defined in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to take a single character string as input and returns its corresponding ASCII value using the `ord()` function. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Function Purpose:** The function's purpose is clearly stated in its docstring: it returns the ASCII value of a given character.
2. **Parameters:** The function correctly accepts a single character as input, which aligns with the expectations in the problem description.
3. **Return Value:** The use of `ord(char)` successfully converts the character to its ASCII value and returns it as an integer, which matches the expected type outlined in the description.

Given the assumption that input will always be valid (i.e., a single character string), the function will always operate correctly without raising exceptions or errors. Thus, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description perfectly.
