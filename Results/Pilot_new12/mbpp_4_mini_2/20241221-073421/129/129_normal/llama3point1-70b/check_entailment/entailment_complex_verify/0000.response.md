Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a single character (of type `str`) as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord()` function. The annotated version clarifies that the function assumes the input will always be valid, meaning it will be a single non-empty character. As a result, the function behaves correctly for all expected cases based on the provided requirements. The annotation explicitly states that the function does not handle cases of invalid input, but since the assumption is that input will be valid (a single character), the function meets the problem description requirements effectively. Thus, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.
