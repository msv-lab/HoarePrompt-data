Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string or is empty. According to the output hints, the function assumes that the input will always be valid, specifically a non-empty string containing exactly one character. However, if a user were to provide an empty string or multiple characters, the function would still run, but the behavior would not be as expected. For example, calling `func_1("")` (an empty string) would raise a `TypeError`, and `func_1("ab")` (a string with more than one character) would also lead to incorrect behavior as the function is designed to return the ASCII value of a single character only. Thus, the program does not conform to the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to an overall incorrectness.
