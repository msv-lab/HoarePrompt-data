Functionality: **The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value as an integer using the `ord()` function. It does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string or is empty, which could result in an error. The function assumes that the input will always be valid, specifically a non-empty string containing exactly one character.**
