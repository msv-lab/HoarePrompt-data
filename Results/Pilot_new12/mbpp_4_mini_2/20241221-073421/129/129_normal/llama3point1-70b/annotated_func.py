#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    """
    Returns the ASCII value of a given character.

    Parameters:
    char (str): A single character.

    Returns:
    int: The ASCII value of the character.
    """
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the ASCII value of the single character string 'char' as an integer using the ord() function
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value as an integer using the `ord()` function. It does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string or is empty, which could result in an error. The function assumes that the input will always be valid, specifically a non-empty string containing exactly one character.
