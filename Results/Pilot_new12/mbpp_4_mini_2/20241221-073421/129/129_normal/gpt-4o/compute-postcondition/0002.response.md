Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function. If the input `char` is not a single character string (e.g., an empty string or a string with more than one character), the function will raise a `TypeError` or `ValueError`. The function does not handle such edge cases or provide any input validation. Thus, it is expected to operate correctly only under the assumption that the input is always a valid single character string. After execution, the state of the program will reflect the ASCII integer value corresponding to the input character.
