Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the ASCII value of a character by using the built-in `ord()` function. The assertions provided examine the function's output for valid single character inputs ('A', 'R', and 'S') and confirm that it returns the correct ASCII values (65, 82, and 83, respectively). 

The annotations clearly outline the functionality of the program and identify that it is expected to work correctly for valid single character string inputs, aligning with the assumption in the context given. Although the function does not handle cases where the input is not a single character, the problem description does not request input validation, and it is stated that valid input will always be provided. This means that under the specified conditions, the program operates correctly. 

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the supporting annotations, the program's correctness is affirmed as it meets the requirements precisely as stated.
