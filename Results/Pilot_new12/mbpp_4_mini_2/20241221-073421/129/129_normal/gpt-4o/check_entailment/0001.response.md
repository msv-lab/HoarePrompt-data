Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a character as input and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function, which is the correct approach to obtain the ASCII value of a character in Python. The provided assertions test the function with different characters ('A', 'R', and 'S') and all return the expected ASCII values as defined in the problem description.

I considered potential edge cases, such as:
- Providing non-ASCII characters (e.g., 'ñ', '€'), which are valid input for the `ord()` function and will return their respective Unicode code points.
- Providing special characters (e.g., '!', '#', '&'), which also have specific ASCII values and should be handled correctly.

Since the function correctly handles valid single-character inputs and the assertion checks confirm that it produces the expected results, I found no instance where the implementation fails to meet the problem description's requirements. 

Thus, the program is correct in all cases handled, leading to the conclusion that it meets the specifications provided.
