Final: **True** 

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` is designed to meet the problem description by finding the ASCII value of a single character. The implementation uses the `ord()` function correctly, and the provided assertions demonstrate that it returns the expected ASCII values for the test cases 'A', 'R', and 'S'. 

While the output hints mention that the function does not perform input validation and will raise an error if the input is not a valid single character, the problem description explicitly states to find the ASCII value of a character. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that valid input will be provided, as outlined in the output hints. Hence, under the assumption that valid single character strings will be the inputs, the function operates correctly as intended. Thus, the correctness is upheld in the examined cases.
