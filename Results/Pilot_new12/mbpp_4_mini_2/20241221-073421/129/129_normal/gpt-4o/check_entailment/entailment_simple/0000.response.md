Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. According to the problem statement, the function must find the ASCII value of a character. 

Here's how the function meets this requirement:

1. The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `char`, which is expected to be a single character string.
2. Inside the function, it uses the `ord()` function, which is a built-in Python function that returns the ASCII value of a given character.
3. The program includes assertions to verify that the function works as intended for specific test cases:
   - `func_1('A')` correctly returns `65`, which is the ASCII value for the character 'A'.
   - `func_1('R')` returns `82`, the ASCII value for 'R'.
   - `func_1('S')` returns `83`, the ASCII value for 'S'.

Since the function is designed to operate under the assumption of valid input (which is specified in your prompt), it correctly calculates the ASCII value for any single character input provided to it. Therefore, the implementation satisfies the requirements of the problem description for all valid cases.
