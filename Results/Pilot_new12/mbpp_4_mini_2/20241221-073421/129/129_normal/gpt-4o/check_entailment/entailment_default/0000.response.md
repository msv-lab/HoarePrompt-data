Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to return the ASCII value of a single character using the `ord()` function. However, it lacks any form of input validation. If the user were to pass an empty string or more than one character, the function would still execute but would not provide the expected behavior. For example, if the input is an empty string `''`, it would raise a `TypeError` when `ord()` attempts to process it. Similarly, if the input is a string with more than one character (e.g., `'AB'`), it would also raise a `TypeError` or return an unexpected result since `ord()` should only be passed a single character. These edge cases indicate that the code does not handle all potential cases as the problem description implies.
