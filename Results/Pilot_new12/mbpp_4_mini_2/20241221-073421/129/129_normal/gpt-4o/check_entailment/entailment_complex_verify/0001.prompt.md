You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the ascii value of a character.
Program:
```
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a character as input and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function, which is the correct approach to obtain the ASCII value of a character in Python. The provided assertions test the function with different characters ('A', 'R', and 'S') and all return the expected ASCII values as defined in the problem description.

I considered potential edge cases, such as:
- Providing non-ASCII characters (e.g., 'ñ', '€'), which are valid input for the `ord()` function and will return their respective Unicode code points.
- Providing special characters (e.g., '!', '#', '&'), which also have specific ASCII values and should be handled correctly.

Since the function correctly handles valid single-character inputs and the assertion checks confirm that it produces the expected results, I found no instance where the implementation fails to meet the problem description's requirements. 

Thus, the program is correct in all cases handled, leading to the conclusion that it meets the specifications provided.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('A') == 65
assert func_1('R') == 82
assert func_1('S') == 83

#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character string.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the ASCII value of the single character string 'char' using ord(char)
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function. If the input `char` is not a single character string (e.g., an empty string or a string with more than one character), the function will raise a `TypeError` or `ValueError`. The function does not handle such edge cases or provide any input validation. Thus, it is expected to operate correctly only under the assumption that the input is always a valid single character string. After execution, the state of the program will reflect the ASCII integer value corresponding to the input character.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
