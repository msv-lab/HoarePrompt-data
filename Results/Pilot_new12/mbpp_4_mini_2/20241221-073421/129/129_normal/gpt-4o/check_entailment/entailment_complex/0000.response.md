Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the ASCII value of a character. The function `func_1` takes a single character string as input and uses the `ord()` function to return its ASCII value. 

The assertions provided in the annotated program confirm that the function returns the expected ASCII values for the input characters 'A', 'R', and 'S', which are 65, 82, and 83, respectively. The code also includes an annotation stating that the function is expected to work correctly under the assumption that the input is always a valid single character string.

Given these points, the program meets the requirements set out in the problem description, as it correctly computes and returns the ASCII value for valid inputs. The lack of error handling for non-character inputs does not affect its correctness under the stated assumption that the input will always be valid, thus fulfilling the problem requirements.
