Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` correctly implements the task of finding the ASCII value of a character by using the `ord()` function. The provided annotations support this, demonstrating that the function behaves as expected when given a valid single character string.

While the annotations mention potential issues with inputs that are not single characters, they also clarify that the function is designed under the assumption that valid input will always be provided. Therefore, since the function meets the specific requirements laid out in the problem description and the assertions confirm its correctness with valid inputs ('A', 'R', 'S'), the conclusion that the program is correct holds true.
