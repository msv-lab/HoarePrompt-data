Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to find the ASCII value of a character, which implies that it should only accept a single character as input. However, the current implementation does not explicitly handle cases where the input is either an empty string or a string with more than one character, which will lead to `TypeError` or `ValueError` from the `ord()` function. 

For instance, if the function is called with an empty string (`func_1('')`) or a string with two characters (`func_1('AB')`), it would not perform as intended, leading to incorrect behavior for those cases. Since the program does not ensure that the input will always be valid and potentially breaks under certain conditions, it cannot be considered correct.
