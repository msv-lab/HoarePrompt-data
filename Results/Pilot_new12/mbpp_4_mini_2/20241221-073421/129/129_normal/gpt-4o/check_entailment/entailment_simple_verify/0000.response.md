Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality to find the ASCII value of a given character using the built-in `ord()` function. The annotations confirm that before calling the function, `char` is a single character string, which aligns with the function's expected input. The assertions validate that the function works as intended for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S', returning their respective ASCII values. Additionally, since the problem description specifically asks for finding the ASCII value of a character, and the function successfully achieves this as stated in the annotations, the overall assessment of the program's correctness remains affirmed.
