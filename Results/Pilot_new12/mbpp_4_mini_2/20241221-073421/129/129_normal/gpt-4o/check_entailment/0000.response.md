Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly utilizes the built-in `ord()` function to find the ASCII value of a given character. The assertions demonstrate that it correctly returns the ASCII values for 'A', 'R', and 'S'. Since `ord()` works for all valid single characters, including numbers, special characters, and letters, the function will handle any character input without errors. Therefore, for the problem's requirement to find the ASCII value of a character, the implementation is correct in all examined cases and also correctly handles edge cases according to Python's specifications. Thus, the correctness is affirmed.
