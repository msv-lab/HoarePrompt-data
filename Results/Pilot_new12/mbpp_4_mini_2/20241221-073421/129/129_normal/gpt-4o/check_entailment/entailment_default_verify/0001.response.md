Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly fulfills the problem description, which is to find the ASCII value of a character. The use of the `ord()` function correctly retrieves the ASCII value for valid single-character string inputs. The assertions provided test the function with valid inputs ('A', 'R', and 'S') and all return expected ASCII values.

Additionally, while it's noted in the output hints that the function does not validate inputs beyond the assumption of valid single character strings, this does not impact its correctness under the specified problem constraints, which assume that inputs are valid. Since the function behaves as expected for valid inputs, we can conclude that it meets the specifications provided in the problem description. Thus, the final correctness assessment remains True.
