According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `size` is greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `size` is greater than 0 and the loop is processing the `size` variable in decreasing order starting from `n` down to 1. To execute one more time, `size` must decrease by 1.

Since the current `size` is `n`, in the next iteration, `size` will be `n - 1`. The condition for the loop will still hold as long as `size` remains positive. 

Thus, the state must reflect that `size` is now `n - 1`.

State: **`arr` is a modified list where the first `size` (which is `n - 1`) elements are reversed, `n` is greater than 1, `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` up to the first `n - 1` elements, and `size` is `n - 1`**
