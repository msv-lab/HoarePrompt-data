Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list in ascending order, `n` is 0 or greater. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executed `n` times, with elements being progressively sorted in each iteration based on the maximum identified until the list is sorted. If `n` is 0, the loop did not execute and `arr` remains unchanged.**
