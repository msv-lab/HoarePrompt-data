The code snippet reverses the sublist of `arr` that includes the first `max_index + 1` elements. Given the preconditions, `max_index` is less than `size` (which is 2), indicating that `max_index` can be either 0 or 1. This operation will affect the list `arr` by reversing one or two of its initial elements based on the value of `max_index`.

1. If `max_index` is 0, `arr[:1]` (which is the first element of `arr`) remains the same after the operation since reversing a single element results in the same element.
2. If `max_index` is 1, both elements in `arr[:2]` will be reversed.

The `size`, `n`, and `max_index` values remain unchanged after the operation, so we keep those in the state description.

Output State: **`arr` has the first `max_index + 1` elements reversed; `size` is 2; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first 2 elements of `arr`.**
