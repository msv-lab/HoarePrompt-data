According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `n` variable, which represents the length of the `arr` list. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0, as it starts from `n` and decrements to 1. Since the loop will execute for `size` starting from `n` down to 1, we also need to ensure `size` corresponds to its initial value. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than 0, and `size` should initially be `n`. 

State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
