Postcondition: ***`arr` is a modified list where the first 2 elements are reversed if `max_index` is not equal to 1 (which indicates the maximum value is in the first element). If `max_index` is 1, the first 2 elements remain in their original order. `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first 2 elements of `arr`.***
