The code snippet reverses the elements of `arr` from the start to the index `max_index`, inclusive. Given the initial state, the list from index `0` to `max_index` is replaced with its reverse.

- `arr` had its first `size` elements initially reversed, and the `max_index` indicates the index of the maximum value in the current segment `arr[:size]`.
- After executing the code, `arr[:max_index + 1]` will now contain the reversed order of its previous values from the beginning of the list `arr` up to and including the `max_index`.

Thus, the states of the other variables are not affected aside from `arr`, which has changed due to the reversal.

Output State: **`arr` is a modified list where the first `size` elements up to `max_index` are now reversed; `n` is greater than 1; `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the modified `arr[:size]`; `size` is `n - 1`.**
