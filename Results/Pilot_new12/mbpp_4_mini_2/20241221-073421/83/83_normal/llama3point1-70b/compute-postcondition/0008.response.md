Postcondition: ***`arr` is a modified list where the first `size` (which is `n`) elements are reversed. Given `n` is greater than 0 and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` up to the first `n` elements, if `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, then the elements from index 0 to `n-1` are reversed, with `max_index` not being 0. If `max_index` were to be equal to `size - 1`, no changes would occur to the list.***
