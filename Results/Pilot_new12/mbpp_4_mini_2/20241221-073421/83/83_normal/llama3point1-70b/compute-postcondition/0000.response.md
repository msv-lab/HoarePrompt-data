The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(arr)`, which represents the number of elements in the list `arr`. While the contents of `arr` are unspecified, the length will be a non-negative integer reflecting how many elements it contains. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements (any data type that supports comparison), `n` is the length of `arr`.**
