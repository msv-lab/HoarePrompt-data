The slice `arr[:max_index + 1]` consists of the elements of `arr` from the beginning up to (and including) the element at `max_index`. The operation `arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]` reverses that slice. The effect of the code is that the first `max_index + 1` elements of `arr` are now in reverse order. The values of `n`, `size`, and `max_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is the modified list with the first `max_index + 1` elements reversed, `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` up to the first `n` elements, not equal to `size - 1` and not equal to 0.**
