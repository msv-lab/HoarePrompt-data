The operation `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the first `size` elements of `arr`. Since `size` is 2, this means the first two elements of `arr` are reversed. 

Assuming `max_index` is not equal to 0, the precondition indicates that the maximum index is determined from the first two elements, which implies that the elements being reversed are the ones we are concerned with.

After the operation, the state of `arr` will have its first two elements swapped. The values of `n` and `max_index` are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` has its first `size` elements reversed, `size` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in the first 2 elements of `arr`.**
