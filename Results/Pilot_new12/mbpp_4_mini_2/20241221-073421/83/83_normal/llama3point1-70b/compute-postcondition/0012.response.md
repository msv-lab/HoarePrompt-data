Postcondition: ***`arr` is a modified list where if `max_index` is not 0, the first `size` elements up to `max_index` are reversed, with `n` greater than 1, and `max_index` being the index of the maximum value in the modified `arr[:size]`; if `max_index` is 0, the state of `arr` remains unchanged.***
