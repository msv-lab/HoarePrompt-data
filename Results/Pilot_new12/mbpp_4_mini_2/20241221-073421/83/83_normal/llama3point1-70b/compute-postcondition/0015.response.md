According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `size` and the range defined by `n`. The loop decrements `size` starting from `n` down to 1. At the end of the last iteration, `size` will be `1` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `size` should be `2`, and the condition set by `n` must be at least `2` for the loop to continue.

State: **`arr` is a modified list where the first `size` elements are reversed if `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1`, `size` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
