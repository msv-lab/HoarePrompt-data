The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of elements that can be of any data type that supports comparison. The functionality of the function is to return the sorted list `arr` in ascending order. If the length of `arr` (denoted as 'n') is 0, the function returns the list unchanged; otherwise, it sorts the list after 'n' iterations.
