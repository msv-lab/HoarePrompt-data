The code snippet provided performs a reversal of a slice of the list `arr` from the beginning up to the size defined by `n`. Given that `max_index` is defined as the index of the maximum value in `arr` up to the first `n` elements, and since `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` or 0, the operation will affect the first `n` elements of the `arr`.

The output state will reflect the modification made to `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a modified list where the first `size` (which is `n`) elements are reversed. `n` is greater than 0, `size` is `n`, and `max_index` is the index of the maximum value in `arr` up to the first `n` elements, which is not equal to `size - 1` and not equal to 0.**
