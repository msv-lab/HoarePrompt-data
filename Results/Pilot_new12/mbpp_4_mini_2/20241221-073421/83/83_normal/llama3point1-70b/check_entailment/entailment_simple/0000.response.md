Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly sort the list `arr` in ascending order. The algorithm implemented is an incorrect sorting technique that attempts to sort the list by repeatedly finding the maximum element and reversing parts of the list. 

Here are the issues identified:

1. **Algorithm Flaw**: The algorithm finds the maximum element in the current sublist (`arr[:size]`) and attempts to move it to its proper position by reversing parts of the list. This approach does not guarantee that the entire list will be sorted correctly, as it can lead to an incorrect ordering of elements.

2. **Sorting Logic**: The logic used for sorting is not a valid sorting algorithm. While there are algorithms that utilize reversals, they usually operate under specific conditions or utilize a different overall strategy (e.g., pancake sorting). The code as written does not conform to a known functional sorting algorithm like bubble sort, merge sort, or quicksort.

3. **Failure on Edge Cases**: While the problem statement assumes valid input, the approach taken in this program may fail on simple scenarios such as when the input list is already partially sorted or contains identical elements. It may not produce the correct final sorted output for various combinations of input lists.

In conclusion, while the input is assumed to be well-formed, the logic of the program itself does not reliably sort the list as required by the problem description. Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirement of sorting a list in ascending order correctly.
