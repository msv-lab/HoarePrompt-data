To determine the correctness of the provided Python program that sorts a list of elements, let's analyze the code and consider potential cases where it might fail or not fulfill the sorting requirement.

The function `func_1` is designed to sort an input list `arr` by repeatedly finding the maximum value in the unsorted portion of the list, moving it to its correct position by reversing segments of the list.

### Analyzing the Code:

1. **Initialization**: The code initializes the length of the input list `arr`.

2. **Outer Loop**: It has an outer loop that iterates from `n` down to `1`, where `n` is the length of the array. This means it progressively considers the entire list down to a single element.

3. **Finding Maximum**: Inside this loop, it finds the index of the maximum element in the unsorted portion of the list.

4. **Reversing Logic**:
   - If the maximum element is not in its correct final position (i.e., not at index `size - 1`), it checks if `max_index` is not `0`. If `max_index` is not at the start, it reverses the slice from the start to `max_index`. 
   - Finally, it reverses the slice from the start to the current `size`.

### Potential Issues:

A critical flaw in the code is that if the maximum value is found at the last index (`size - 1`), the operations to reverse segments of the list are skipped. This approach can lead to incorrect ordering, particularly if the list contains duplicate elements or if the maximum value is at an earlier index due to the incomplete handling of the ordering of other elements.

#### Example Failure Case:

Consider the input list:
```python
[3, 1, 2, 3]
```

- The maximum element in the first iteration (`size == 4`) is `3` at index `0`. The segment `arr[:1]` would be reversed, resulting in no change since it contains only `3`. Then the segment `arr[:4]` is reversed to get `[3, 2, 1, 3]`.
- In the next iteration (`size == 3`), the maximum element is `3` again at index `3`, it does not perform the reversal operation.
- Then for `size == 2`, the maximum is `2` at index `1`, and the list ends up being `[2, 3, 1, 3]`.
- Finally, for `size == 1`, it does nothing more.

The final output would be `[2, 3, 1, 3]`, which is not sorted.

### Conclusion:

Since the function does not correctly sort the list for certain input cases, particularly those involving duplicates and varying positions of the maximum elements, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
