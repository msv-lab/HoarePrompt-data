To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` closely.

The function is intended to sort a list of elements that can be of any data type supporting comparison. Here are some aspects to consider:

1. **Sorting Logic**: The function uses a modified selection-sort approach by finding the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list and reversing segments to place it at the end of the sorted portion. This logic should generally lead to a sorted list if applied correctly.

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The output hints indicate that if the input list is empty, it remains unchanged, which matches the sorting requirement. However, an important area of concern is the handling of repeated elements and whether the function consistently returns a sorted list in all scenarios.

3. **Potential Failure Cases**:
   - The function relies on the `max()` function and `index()` which returns the first occurrence of the maximum element. When there are repeated elements, the maximum element is consistently reversed to the end, which may lead to incorrect placements.
   - Lists of elements that are not comparable (e.g., a mix of strings and numbers) can raise exceptions due to the comparison operations.

### Evaluation:
Despite the hints noting various evaluations of maximum elements and the appropriate checks for different scenarios, the fact that the program could fail to sort correctly in some complex cases or when handling elements of different types leads to doubts about its universal correctness.

**Conclusion**: Given the requirements and potential issues stated above, I conclude that the program does not adhere to the problem description in all cases, particularly with repeated elements or mixed types.

Correctness: **False**
