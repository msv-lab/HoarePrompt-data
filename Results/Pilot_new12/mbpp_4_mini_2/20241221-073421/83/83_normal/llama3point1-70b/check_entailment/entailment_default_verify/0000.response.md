Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not correctly sort lists with duplicate elements. The specific example provided, `[3, 2, 1, 2]`, demonstrates that the function can yield incorrect results due to its reliance on reversing sections of the list based on the maximum element. This leads to situations where the order of duplicate elements may be disrupted, resulting in an unsorted or incorrectly sorted output.

The output hints indicate that the function may not properly handle lists with repeated elements, which reinforces the original assessment's concern. Additionally, while the function claims to sort the list in ascending order, it does not account for cases of duplicates effectively, violating the requirement for a correct sorting function as outlined in the problem description. Thus, the evidence from both the assessment and the output hints supports the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
