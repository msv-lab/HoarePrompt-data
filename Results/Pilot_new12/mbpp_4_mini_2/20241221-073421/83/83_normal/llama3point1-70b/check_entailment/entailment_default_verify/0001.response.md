Based on the detailed analysis provided in the original assessment, it is clear that the implementation of `func_1` does not sufficiently sort the list under certain conditions, particularly in the presence of duplicate elements or other varying arrangements of elements. 

The original assessment's reasoning outlined several specific failure scenarios that demonstrate the program's inability to produce a fully sorted list, even while attempting to use a modification of the selection sort algorithm. It emphasizes a concrete example where the final output is not sorted, further supporting the conclusion of the program's incorrectness. 

Additionally, the output hints indicate that while the function is designed to sort a list and handle various placements of elements, it ultimately fails to implement a correct sorting algorithm. The handling of edge cases, such as lists with repeated elements, is also mentioned as potentially problematic, further reinforcing that the function does not meet the expected sorting functionality.

Overall, the assessment is consistent with the findings regarding the actual behavior of the program.

Final: **False**
