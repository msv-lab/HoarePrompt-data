Correctness: **False**.

The provided sorting function does not account for the case of duplicates in the list. For example, if we take the input list `[3, 2, 1, 2]`, the expected output after sorting should be `[1, 2, 2, 3]`. However, when passing this input to the function `func_1`, it may not correctly sort the list due to how it finds the maximum element and reverses the sections of the list. The logic used can lead to incorrect placements of elements and ultimately an unsorted or incorrectly sorted list. 

Here is a specific case showing how the function does not work as expected:
- Input: `[3, 2, 1, 2]`
- Expected output: `[1, 2, 2, 3]`
- Actual output when running the function may yield an incorrect result.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
