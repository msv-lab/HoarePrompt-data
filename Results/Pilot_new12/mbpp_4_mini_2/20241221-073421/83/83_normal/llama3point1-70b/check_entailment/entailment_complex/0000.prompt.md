You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, which can be of any data type that supports comparison.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list in ascending order, `n` is 0 or greater. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executed `n` times, with elements being progressively sorted in each iteration based on the maximum identified until the list is sorted. If `n` is 0, the loop did not execute and `arr` remains unchanged.
    return arr
    #The program returns the sorted list 'arr' in ascending order, which remains unchanged if 'n' is 0; otherwise, it is sorted after 'n' iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` as a parameter, which can contain elements of any data type that supports comparison. It attempts to sort the list in ascending order using a modified selection sort algorithm. If the input list is empty, it remains unchanged. After execution, if `arr` contains at least one element, the function returns the sorted list. It handles cases where the maximum element is found at various positions and includes operations to reverse portions of the list to achieve sorted order. Potential edge cases include handling lists with repeated elements or elements that may not be comparable, which could raise exceptions.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
