#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, which can be of any data type that supports comparison.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for size in range(n, 0, -1):
        max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))
        
        if max_index != size - 1:
            if max_index != 0:
                arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]
            arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list in ascending order, `n` is 0 or greater. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop executed `n` times, with elements being progressively sorted in each iteration based on the maximum identified until the list is sorted. If `n` is 0, the loop did not execute and `arr` remains unchanged.
    return arr
    #The program returns the sorted list 'arr' in ascending order, which remains unchanged if 'n' is 0; otherwise, it is sorted after 'n' iterations.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` as a parameter, which can contain elements of any data type that supports comparison. It attempts to sort the list in ascending order using a modified selection sort algorithm. If the input list is empty, it remains unchanged. After execution, if `arr` contains at least one element, the function returns the sorted list. It handles cases where the maximum element is found at various positions and includes operations to reverse portions of the list to achieve sorted order. Potential edge cases include handling lists with repeated elements or elements that may not be comparable, which could raise exceptions.
