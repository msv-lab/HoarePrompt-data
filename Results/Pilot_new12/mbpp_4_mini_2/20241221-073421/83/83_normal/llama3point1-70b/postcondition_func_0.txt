The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` as a parameter, which can contain elements of any data type that supports comparison. It attempts to sort the list in ascending order using a modified selection sort algorithm. If the input list is empty, it remains unchanged. After execution, if `arr` contains at least one element, the function returns the sorted list. It handles cases where the maximum element is found at various positions and includes operations to reverse portions of the list to achieve sorted order. Potential edge cases include handling lists with repeated elements or elements that may not be comparable, which could raise exceptions.
