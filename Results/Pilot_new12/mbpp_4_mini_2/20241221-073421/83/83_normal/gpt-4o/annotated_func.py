#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements that can be compared, and its length is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared and is sorted in non-decreasing order, `n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is less than 2 then `arr` remains unchanged.
    return arr
    #The program returns the sorted list 'arr' which remains unchanged if n is less than 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list, `arr`, which contains elements that can be compared. It attempts to sort the list in non-decreasing order by performing flipping operations based on the maximum value's index within progressively smaller subarrays. If the length of `arr` (denoted by `n`) is less than 2, the function does not modify the list and returns it unchanged. If `n` is 2 or more, `arr` is sorted at the conclusion of the function. The function ultimately returns the modified or unchanged list `arr`, depending on its initial length. However, the sorting method is dependent on the correctness and behavior of the helper functions `find_max_index` and `flip`, which are not defined in the provided code. Consequently, without the definition of these functions, we cannot guarantee that the list will always be sorted as stated.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer representing the last index of the list to be flipped, and start is initially 0, ensuring that 0 <= start < end.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to the original value of `end` plus 1, `end` is equal to the original value of `start` minus 1, and the list `arr` is fully reversed between the original indices of `start` and `end`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `end`, which represents the last index of the list `arr` to be flipped in place. It flips the elements of the list `arr` between the indices 0 and `end`, effectively reversing the order of these elements. The function modifies the list `arr` directly, and it is assumed that `arr` is defined globally or within the accessible scope. After execution, the portion of the list from index 0 to `end` will be reversed. An important edge case to consider is when `end` is 0; in this case, the function does not perform any operations, and the list remains unchanged. Additionally, if `end` is less than or equal to 0, the function will not execute the while loop and will also leave the list as is. Therefore, the function does not handle situations where `end` is negative or when `end` is set such that it references an out-of-bound index.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the list to be sorted, and arr is a list of elements where arr[i] refers to the elements in the list.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of elements, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` after the loop completes, which was determined by comparing each element in `arr` with the current maximum found at `arr[max_index]`. If `n` is 1, `max_index` remains 0 as there are no other elements to compare against.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum element in the list 'arr', which is 'max_index'. If n is 1, max_index remains 0 because there are no other elements to compare against.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list `arr` and aims to return the index of the maximum element in `arr`. However, the function is incomplete as it does not include `arr` as a parameter, which means it cannot access the list to perform the comparison. As a consequence, the actual functionality regarding the state after execution is flawed: it would raise a NameError due to the undefined variable `arr`. If `arr` were correctly passed as an argument, the function would iterate through the list to find the maximum value and return its index. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 0 (not allowed as per precondition) or `1`, in which case the function should logically return `0` since there are no other elements to compare. The function currently will not handle an empty list or any error checking for invalid input values, leading to potential runtime errors.
