The variable `max_index` is initialized to 0. This does not affect the value of `n` (which is a positive integer) or the contents of the list `arr` (which contains elements indexed by `arr[i]`). Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged while `max_index` is simply assigned the value of 0. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list to be sorted, `arr` is a list of elements, `max_index` is 0**
