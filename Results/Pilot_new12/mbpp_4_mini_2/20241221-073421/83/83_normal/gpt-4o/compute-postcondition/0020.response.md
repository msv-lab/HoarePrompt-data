Functionality: **The function accepts a list, `arr`, which contains elements that can be compared. It attempts to sort the list in non-decreasing order by performing flipping operations based on the maximum value's index within progressively smaller subarrays. If the length of `arr` (denoted by `n`) is less than 2, the function does not modify the list and returns it unchanged. If `n` is 2 or more, `arr` is sorted at the conclusion of the function. The function ultimately returns the modified or unchanged list `arr`, depending on its initial length. However, the sorting method is dependent on the correctness and behavior of the helper functions `find_max_index` and `flip`, which are not defined in the provided code. Consequently, without the definition of these functions, we cannot guarantee that the list will always be sorted as stated.**
