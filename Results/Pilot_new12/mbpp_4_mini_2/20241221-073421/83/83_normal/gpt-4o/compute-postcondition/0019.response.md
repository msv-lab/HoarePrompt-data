The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, and its length is a non-negative integer. If the length of `arr` is less than 2, the function returns the original list unchanged. Otherwise, it returns the sorted list of `arr`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `arr` and return the sorted version of the list if its length is 2 or more; otherwise, it returns the unchanged list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list arr and returns a sorted version of the list if its length is 2 or more; otherwise, it returns the unchanged list.**
