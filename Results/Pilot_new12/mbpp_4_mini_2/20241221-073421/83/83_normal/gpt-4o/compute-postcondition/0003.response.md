The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_index`, meaning that `max_index` will now have the value of `i`, which is `1`. The previous value of `max_index` was `0`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `arr`, and `i`) remain the same. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of elements, `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `arr[i]` is greater than the current value of `arr[max_index]`.**
