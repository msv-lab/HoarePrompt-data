Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of elements, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` after the loop completes, which was determined by comparing each element in `arr` with the current maximum found at `arr[max_index]`. If `n` is 1, `max_index` remains 0 as there are no other elements to compare against.**
