The variable `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 3. Thus, the output state reflects this update. Other variables such as `n` and `arr` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of elements, `i` is 3, `max_index` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of elements, `i` is 3, `max_index` is 3**.
