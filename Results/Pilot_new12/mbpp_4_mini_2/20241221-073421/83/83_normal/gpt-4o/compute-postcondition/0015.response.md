Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `end`, which represents the last index of the list `arr` to be flipped in place. It flips the elements of the list `arr` between the indices 0 and `end`, effectively reversing the order of these elements. The function modifies the list `arr` directly, and it is assumed that `arr` is defined globally or within the accessible scope. After execution, the portion of the list from index 0 to `end` will be reversed. An important edge case to consider is when `end` is 0; in this case, the function does not perform any operations, and the list remains unchanged. Additionally, if `end` is less than or equal to 0, the function will not execute the while loop and will also leave the list as is. Therefore, the function does not handle situations where `end` is negative or when `end` is set such that it references an out-of-bound index.**
