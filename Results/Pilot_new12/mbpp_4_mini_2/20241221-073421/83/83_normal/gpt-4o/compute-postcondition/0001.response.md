According to the code, the loop will execute starting with the value of `i` at 1 and will run until it reaches `n - 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1; since it is specified that `n` is a positive integer, this condition is guaranteed. 

At the beginning of the first iteration, the `i` variable will be set to 1. The other variables `arr` and `max_index` are not crucial for the loop's execution itself but may be involved in the loop's body.

Therefore, to ensure that the for loop can execute properly, we can state the following:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of elements, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1**
