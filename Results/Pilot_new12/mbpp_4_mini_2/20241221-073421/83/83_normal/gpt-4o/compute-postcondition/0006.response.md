In the provided code snippet, `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`. Since `i` is equal to 2, `max_index` will now reflect this value. The initial condition states that `max_index` is updated if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`, but in this case, the code snippet does not include any checks regarding this condition; it unconditionally assigns `max_index`. The other variables (`n`, `arr`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of elements, `i` is 2, `max_index` is 2**
