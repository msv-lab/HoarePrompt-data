According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range specified by `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and runs while `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to 1 and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, changing its value to 2. The loop will continue as long as 2 is less than `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of elements, `i` is 2, `max_index` is updated if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[max_index]`**
