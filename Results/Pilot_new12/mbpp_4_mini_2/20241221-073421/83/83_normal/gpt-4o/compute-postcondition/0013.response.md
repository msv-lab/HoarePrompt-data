The function `find_max_index` accepts two parameters: `n` and `arr`. `n` is a positive integer representing the length of the list `arr`, which contains elements. The function returns the index of the maximum element in the list `arr`. If `n` is 1, the function returns `0` since there are no other elements to compare against. Therefore, the functionality of the function `find_max_index` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `arr`, and return the index of the maximum element in the list, defaulting to `0` when the list contains only one element.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list arr, returning the index of the maximum element in the list arr. If n is 1, it returns 0.**
