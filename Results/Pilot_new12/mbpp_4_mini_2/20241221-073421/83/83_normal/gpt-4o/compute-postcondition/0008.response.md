According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Currently, `i` is 2. In the next iteration of the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1 to 3. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 3. 

Since `i` is being updated from 2 to 3 in the next iteration, we must ensure that `n` is greater than 3 to allow the loop to continue executing.

State: **`n` is a positive integer that must be greater than 3, `arr` is a list of elements, and `i` is 3**
