Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The main reason the program is incorrect is due to the definitions of the helper functions `find_max_index` and `flip`. The `find_max_index` function does not accept the list `arr` as a parameter, which results in a `NameError` since `arr` is not defined in its scope. This severely undermines the functionality of the sorting operation in `func_1`, as it cannot effectively determine the maximum element to perform flipping operations. 

Furthermore, the `flip` function relies on the global state of `arr`, which makes it vulnerable to issues if `arr` is not defined or modified in unexpected ways. The descriptions of the functions also indicate that there are potential edge cases that the current implementation does not handle adequately, like if `end` in the `flip` function is less than or equal to 0.

As such, since the program does not function correctly due to issues with achieving its intended purpose reliably and raising errors, it does not fulfill the problem description requirements for correctly sorting a list for every potential case.
