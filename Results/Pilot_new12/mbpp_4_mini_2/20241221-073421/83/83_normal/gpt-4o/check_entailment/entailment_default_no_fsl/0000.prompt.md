You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Functions with output description for each function:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(arr):


    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a list, `arr`, which contains elements that can be compared. It attempts to sort the list in non-decreasing order by performing flipping operations based on the maximum value's index within progressively smaller subarrays. If the length of `arr` (denoted by `n`) is less than 2, the function does not modify the list and returns it unchanged. If `n` is 2 or more, `arr` is sorted at the conclusion of the function. The function ultimately returns the modified or unchanged list `arr`, depending on its initial length. However, the sorting method is dependent on the correctness and behavior of the helper functions `find_max_index` and `flip`, which are not defined in the provided code. Consequently, without the definition of these functions, we cannot guarantee that the list will always be sorted as stated.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `end`, which represents the last index of the list `arr` to be flipped in place. It flips the elements of the list `arr` between the indices 0 and `end`, effectively reversing the order of these elements. The function modifies the list `arr` directly, and it is assumed that `arr` is defined globally or within the accessible scope. After execution, the portion of the list from index 0 to `end` will be reversed. An important edge case to consider is when `end` is 0; in this case, the function does not perform any operations, and the list remains unchanged. Additionally, if `end` is less than or equal to 0, the function will not execute the while loop and will also leave the list as is. Therefore, the function does not handle situations where `end` is negative or when `end` is set such that it references an out-of-bound index.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list `arr` and aims to return the index of the maximum element in `arr`. However, the function is incomplete as it does not include `arr` as a parameter, which means it cannot access the list to perform the comparison. As a consequence, the actual functionality regarding the state after execution is flawed: it would raise a NameError due to the undefined variable `arr`. If `arr` were correctly passed as an argument, the function would iterate through the list to find the maximum value and return its index. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 0 (not allowed as per precondition) or `1`, in which case the function should logically return `0` since there are no other elements to compare. The function currently will not handle an empty list or any error checking for invalid input values, leading to potential runtime errors.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
