You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements that can be compared, and its length is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements that can be compared and is sorted in non-decreasing order, `n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is less than 2 then `arr` remains unchanged.
    return arr
    #The program returns the sorted list 'arr' which remains unchanged if n is less than 2.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: end is a non-negative integer representing the last index of the list to be flipped, and start is initially 0, ensuring that 0 <= start < end.
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `start` is equal to the original value of `end` plus 1, `end` is equal to the original value of `start` minus 1, and the list `arr` is fully reversed between the original indices of `start` and `end`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the length of the list to be sorted, and arr is a list of elements where arr[i] refers to the elements in the list.
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `arr` is a list of elements, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr` after the loop completes, which was determined by comparing each element in `arr` with the current maximum found at `arr[max_index]`. If `n` is 1, `max_index` remains 0 as there are no other elements to compare against.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum element in the list 'arr', which is 'max_index'. If n is 1, max_index remains 0 because there are no other elements to compare against.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
