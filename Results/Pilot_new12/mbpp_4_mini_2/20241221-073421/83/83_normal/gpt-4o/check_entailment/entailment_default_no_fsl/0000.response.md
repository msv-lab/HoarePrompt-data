Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the helper functions `find_max_index` and `flip` are not defined properly to work with the list that `func_1` attempts to sort. 

1. **Find Max Index Issue**: The `find_max_index` function does not accept `arr` as a parameter, which leads to a `NameError` when `func_1` tries to call it. Since the function depends on accessing `arr` directly, it will fail when called.

2. **Flipping Issue**: The `flip` function assumes that `arr` is globally accessible, but this could also lead to issues if there are naming conflicts or if `arr` is not defined in the expected scope. This reliance on a global variable makes the function less modular and more error-prone.

3. **Sorting Process**: Even if the helper functions were correctly defined, the sorting algorithm used relies on flipping and doesn't follow a traditional sorting mechanism such as quicksort or mergesort. Therefore, even if there were no errors, we cannot guarantee that it would always produce a sorted list as expected.

Due to these issues, the program does not properly implement the described functionality to sort a list, leading to incorrect behavior in various scenarios, such as when it encounters a list with more than one item. Thus, it is classified as incorrect according to the criteria provided.
