To determine the correctness of the provided program for sorting a list of elements, we need to analyze the given code and look for potential issues with its implementation:

1. **Functionality of Each Function**:
   - `func_1`: This function appears to sort the array by repeatedly finding the maximum index of unsorted elements and flipping the array at that index to move the maximum element to its proper position.
   - `flip`: This function reverses the part of the list from the start index to the end index.
   - `find_max_index`: This function finds the index of the maximum element in a subarray starting from 0 to `n-1`.

2. **Issues in the Code**:
   - The variable `arr` is used within `find_max_index`, but `arr` is not defined as a parameter for that function, leading to potential NameError suggesting `arr` is expected to be a global variable, which is generally not a good practice.
   - The main sorting logic in `func_1` also does not handle the case when the input is empty; while an empty list is already sorted, it should explicitly return the input list.

3. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - Given an empty list `[]`, the function should simply return `[]`. However, since the implementation does not handle this case explicitly, it could lead to an error.
   - For a single-element list, such as `[1]`, it should return the same list.

4. **Conclusion**:
Given the issues with variable scope and the handling of edge cases (like empty lists and single-element lists), the program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
