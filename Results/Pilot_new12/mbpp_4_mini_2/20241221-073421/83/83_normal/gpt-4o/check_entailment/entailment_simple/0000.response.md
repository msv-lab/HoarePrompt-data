The provided program is intended to sort a list of elements as per the problem description. It consists of three functions: `func_1`, `flip`, and `find_max_index`. Upon reviewing the program, the following points are relevant to ascertain correctness:

1. **Sorting Mechanism**: The main function `func_1` appears to implement a sorting algorithm based on a method known as "pancake sorting." It identifies the maximum element's index for the current subsection of the list and flips the list to bring the maximum element to the end of the sorted portion progressively.

2. **Functionality**:
   - `flip` correctly reverses the segment of the list between `start` and `end`.
   - `find_max_index` identifies the index of the maximum value in the given portion of the list.

3. **Correct Logic**: The logic used for sorting by flipping elements ensures that elements are organized in non-decreasing order. The outer loop decrements the size of the portion being sorted until it considers a sublist of size 1, at which point the sorting is complete.

4. **Edge Cases**: The logic contains a condition that if the input list has less than two elements (`n` < 2), it will return the list unchanged, which aligns with the expectation that a list of zero or one item is inherently sorted.

5. **Test Validation**: The assertions provided validate that the function executes correctly for the specified test cases. It returns the expected sorted lists for the given examples.

However, there is one noticeable issue:

- **Variable Scope Error**: The functions `flip` and `find_max_index` refer to `arr`, but `arr` is defined only in `func_1`. This leads to a scope error regarding the `arr` variable. The functions `flip` and `find_max_index` need `arr` to be passed as an argument to work correctly. This failure in managing variable scope implies that the function would raise an error when executed even though the logical flow aligns with the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
Due to the variable scope issue, the code does not function correctly, meaning it does not always perform as expected per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
