Final: **False** 

The original assessment is accurate due to several critical issues in the code that prevent it from correctly fulfilling the problem description of sorting a list. Firstly, the `find_max_index` function lacks the necessary parameter to access the list being sorted, leading to a `NameError` when called. This is a fundamental flaw as the function is unable to perform its intended task, rendering the overall sorting logic in `func_1` ineffective. 

Furthermore, the program does not explicitly handle edge cases for empty lists or single-element lists, which, while may not result in errors, still demonstrates a lack of robustness in design. Thus, the functions do not collectively meet the requirements to sort a list, supporting the conclusion of the original assessment.
