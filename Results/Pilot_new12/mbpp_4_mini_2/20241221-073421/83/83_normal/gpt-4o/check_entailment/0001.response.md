Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to sort a list of elements, but it has several issues:

1. The variable `arr` is referenced in the `find_max_index` function, but it is not defined within the function's scope or passed as an argument. This will cause a `NameError` when `find_max_index` is called because `arr` is undefined.

2. The `flip` function does not correctly handle the case where the list has only one element. If `arr` is empty (or only has one element), the sorting logic will not function correctly, leading to a potential failure or no output.

3. The main sorting logic in `func_1` assumes that flipping will move the maximum element to its correct position. However, without the correct access to `arr`, it cannot perform as expected.

An example of failure case:
- If `arr` is `[3, 1, 2]`, the expected output is `[1, 2, 3]`. However, due to the undefined `arr` in the scope of `find_max_index`, the program will raise an error.

Because the program does not adhere to the requirements of successfully sorting a list due to these issues, I conclude that it is incorrect.
