The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of elements in the list `arr` and aims to return the index of the maximum element in `arr`. However, the function is incomplete as it does not include `arr` as a parameter, which means it cannot access the list to perform the comparison. As a consequence, the actual functionality regarding the state after execution is flawed: it would raise a NameError due to the undefined variable `arr`. If `arr` were correctly passed as an argument, the function would iterate through the list to find the maximum value and return its index. Edge cases include scenarios where `n` is 0 (not allowed as per precondition) or `1`, in which case the function should logically return `0` since there are no other elements to compare. The function currently will not handle an empty list or any error checking for invalid input values, leading to potential runtime errors.
