Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. Here's an explanation of why the implementation is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(nums)` is designed to find the size of the largest subset of a given list of integers such that every pair of integers within the subset is divisible by one another.

2. **Handling Empty Lists**: The first condition checks if `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns `0`, which is the expected behavior when there are no numbers to form a subset.

3. **Sorting the List**: The function sorts the input list `nums`. This is important because divisibility checks will only need to be performed in one direction (from smaller to larger values), which simplifies the logic and ensures that any valid divisible subset can be formed correctly.

4. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The `dp` array is initialized to `1` for all elements, indicating that the minimum size of a divisible subset containing any single element is `1` (the element itself). The program then accurately builds upon this by exploring each possible pair of elements.

5. **Nested Loops for Building the Subset**: The nested loops iterate over all pairs of integers in the sorted list, checking if one integer is divisible by another. If so, the function updates the `dp` array to reflect the longest divisible subset found so far for the element at index `i`.

6. **Calculating Maximum Size**: Finally, it correctly returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset where every pair of integers is divisible by each other.

Overall, the implementation accurately follows the problem description and correctly manages to find the largest divisible subset for any valid input of integers. There are no cases where it fails to meet the stated requirements since it handles typical edge cases (like empty lists) and follows the logic necessary to determine divisible subsets effectively.
