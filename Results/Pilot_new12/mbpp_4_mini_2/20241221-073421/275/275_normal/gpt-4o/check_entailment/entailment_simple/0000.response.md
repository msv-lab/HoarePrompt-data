Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` accurately implements the requirements as outlined in the problem description. It determines the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers within that subset is divisible.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the function meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function checks if the input list `nums` is empty and returns 0, which is appropriate because an empty list cannot have a subset.

2. **Sorting**: It sorts the list `nums`, which is necessary for efficiently finding divisible pairs as smaller numbers must come first in order for the divisibility condition to be checked properly.

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: The program creates an array `dp` initialized to 1 for each element. This setup assumes that each number can at least form a subset by itself.

4. **Nested Loops for Divisibility Check**: The outer loop iterates through each number, and the inner loop checks all previous numbers to see if they are divisible. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to reflect the largest subset including `nums[i]`, thus building the solution incrementally.

5. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which indicates the size of the largest subset where every pair of numbers is divisible, precisely aligning with the problem requirements.

The function works efficiently for its purpose, and the logic correctly accumulates the size of subsets, complying with the stipulations given in the problem description. Since there are no flaws in the logic or missing conditions, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
