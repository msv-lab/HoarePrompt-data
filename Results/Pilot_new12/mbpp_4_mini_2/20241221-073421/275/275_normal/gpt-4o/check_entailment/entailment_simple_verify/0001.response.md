Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly handle all scenarios of subset selection where every pair is divisible. Although it works for some straightforward cases, it fails on inputs where divisibility is not universally applicable among all numbers in the list. For instance, in the input `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4])`, the program provides an incorrect maximum size of subset, showcasing the flaws in its logic. 

The annotated version supports the original assessment by highlighting how the program counts divisible pairs based on sorted indices without properly addressing edge cases where numbers may only share limited divisibility relationships. Thus, the assessment that the algorithm may handle simpler cases but fails for more complex configurations remains valid.

In conclusion, while the program contains a structure that can handle divisibility in simple situations, it ultimately does not fulfill the complete requirements laid out in the problem description. The reasoning provided in the original assessment correctly identifies these shortcomings.
