Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases described in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for lists containing negative integers or zero. 

For example:
- If the input is `[-1, 2, 4]`, the expected behavior is not clear, as negative numbers can create ambiguity with divisibility. The current implementation would not correctly evaluate such cases for subsets.
- If the input includes `0`, such as `[0, 3, 6]`, the definition of divisibility is problematic since every number is divisible by zero, which might lead to inaccuracies in subset size calculations.

Thus, since the program does not correctly handle these edge cases and could lead to incorrect outputs, the correctness is deemed **False**.
