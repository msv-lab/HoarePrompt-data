You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in that subset is divisible. However, it returns an incorrect result for certain test cases.

For example, consider the input:

```python
assert func_1([2, 4, 8]) == 3  # This should return 3, as every number is divisible by 2.
```

But if we try a different input that contains numbers where pairs are not divisible, e.g.:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4]) == 2  # In this case, a valid subset is {1, 2} or {2, 4}, which has size 2.
```

The algorithm does not correctly account for all potential subsets that can be formed. Also, if we have:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32]) == 6  # Correctly gives us 6 since all are pairwise divisible.
```

The program seems to work well with those inputs, but it misses edge cases with numbers that are not related in divisibility but are included in other ways.

Ultimately, we identify that the program may handle straightforward cases well but can fail for more complex inputs (for example, numbers that have no divisibility relationship other than trivial cases). Thus, since we have shown cases where it provides incorrect subsets, the correctness of the algorithm overall is flawed.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers. If `nums` is empty, the function returns 0. If `nums` contains elements, the function sorts the list, computes the lengths of the longest divisible subsets in `nums`, and returns the maximum length among these subsets. The function handles potential edge cases, including empty lists, but it does not explicitly handle lists containing negative integers, zero, or non-integer elements, which may affect the validity of the calculations based on divisibility. The final state of the program after execution is either returning 0 or the maximum length of the longest divisible subset found.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
