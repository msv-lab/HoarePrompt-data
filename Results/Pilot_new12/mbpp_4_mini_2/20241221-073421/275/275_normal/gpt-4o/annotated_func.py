#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the list `nums` is currently empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a non-empty list of integers.
    nums.sort()

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the length of the longest divisible subset for each index, `dp[i]` reflects the maximum count of divisible integers from `nums` that can form `nums[i]` using integers from previous indices in `nums`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `nums` is empty), `dp` remains an empty list.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp`, which contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each index derived from the sorted list `nums`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `nums`, which is expected to be a list of integers. If `nums` is empty, the function returns 0. If `nums` contains elements, the function sorts the list, computes the lengths of the longest divisible subsets in `nums`, and returns the maximum length among these subsets. The function handles potential edge cases, including empty lists, but it does not explicitly handle lists containing negative integers, zero, or non-integer elements, which may affect the validity of the calculations based on divisibility. The final state of the program after execution is either returning 0 or the maximum length of the longest divisible subset found.
