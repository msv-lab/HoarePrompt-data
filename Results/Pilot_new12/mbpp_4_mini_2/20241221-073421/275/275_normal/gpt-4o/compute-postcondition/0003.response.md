In this case, the initial state indicates that `nums` is a non-empty list of integers. The operation `nums.sort()` sorts the list in ascending order. Since `nums` was a non-empty list of integers, it will now be a sorted version of that list. However, the specific contents of the list are not given, so we can denote the sorted list using a generic form.

The output state will reflect that `nums` is now sorted.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers**
