According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will only execute if `i` is greater than 0; otherwise, it will not run at all. The current state is that `i` is 0, which means the loop cannot start. 

To allow the loop to execute, `i` needs to be greater than 0. Since `nums` is a sorted list that must have at least 1 element and `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`, we do not need to modify those states for the loop to run.

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `i` must be greater than 0. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, `i` must be greater than 0**
