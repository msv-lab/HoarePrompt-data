According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of the `nums` list. Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `len(nums)` must be at least 1 for the loop to start. At the end of the last iteration, `i` represents the current index being processed. The index `i` will increase by 1 for the next iteration. 

Since the loop iterates from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums)`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to the current index (which is `len(nums) - 1` if it was the last iteration), so in the next state, `i` will be incremented by 1, leading to `i` being equal to `len(nums)`. The loop will stop executing when `i` becomes equal to `len(nums)`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `dp[i]` represents the maximum count of divisible integers from `nums` where `nums[i]` can be formed by multiples of previous integers in `nums`, `i` is equal to `len(nums)`**.
