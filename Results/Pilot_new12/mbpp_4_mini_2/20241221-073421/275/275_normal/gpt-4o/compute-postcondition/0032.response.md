`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The values of `dp[j]` and `dp[i]` change based on their previous states. Since `dp[j]` represents the count of divisible integers related to `nums[0]` and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it means `dp[i]` is being updated to reflect that there is one more integer in the divisible chain, hence possibly increasing its count. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `i` is `len(nums)`, `j` is 0, `dp[j]` represents the count of divisible integers related to `nums[0]`, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
