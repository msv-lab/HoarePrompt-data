According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`. If `i` is greater than the current value of `j`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the same as before, and we need to ensure that `j` is updated to the next integer. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1, which means it will be equal to `i`. Therefore, the loop will execute again if `i` is increased appropriately.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, index `j` is `i`, which is equal to the next integer to be processed, and `dp[i]` must reflect any updates based on the new `j`.**
