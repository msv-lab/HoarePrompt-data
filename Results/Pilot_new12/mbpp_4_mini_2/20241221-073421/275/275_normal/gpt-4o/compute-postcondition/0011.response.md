The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `j` is 0, this means that `dp[j]` refers to the first element of `dp`, and we are incrementing this element by 1. The exact value of `dp[i]` will depend on its current state relative to `dp[j] + 1`.

Since `dp[i]` can either be greater than or equal to `dp[j] + 1`, we can state that `dp[i]` will either remain the same or be updated to `dp[j] + 1`. 

The states of other variables (`nums`, `i`, and `j`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that contains at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to be max(`dp[i]`, `dp[0] + 1`).**
