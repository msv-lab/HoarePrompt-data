Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the length of the longest divisible subset for each index, `dp[i]` reflects the maximum count of divisible integers from `nums` that can form `nums[i]` using integers from previous indices in `nums`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `nums` is empty), `dp` remains an empty list.**
