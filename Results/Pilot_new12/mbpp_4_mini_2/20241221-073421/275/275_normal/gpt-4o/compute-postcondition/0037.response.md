According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as the variable `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to `i + 1`. However, since `j` must remain less than `i` for the loop to be executed again, this loop cannot execute any further.

Thus, the conditions must be adjusted to indicate that further execution is not possible. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `j` is equal to `i`, and the loop cannot execute again since `j` cannot be less than `i`.**
