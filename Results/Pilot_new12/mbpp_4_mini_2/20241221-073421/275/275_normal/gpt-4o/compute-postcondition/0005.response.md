According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `nums`. Since `range(len(nums))` yields values from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`, the loop will execute as long as `nums` has at least one element. The state of `dp` indicates it has the same length as `nums`, which is appropriate for its intended use in the loop. 

If `nums` is an empty list, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `nums` should have at least one element, and the index `i` would start at 0.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, and `i` is 0**
