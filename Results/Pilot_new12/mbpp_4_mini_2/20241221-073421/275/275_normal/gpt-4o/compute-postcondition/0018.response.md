According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. Since `i` is initialized as `len(nums)`, it will be equal to the number of elements in the `nums` list. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers that contains at least one element, `i` will be at least 1. The loop will iterate over the range of `i`, which means `j` will take values from 0 up to `i - 1`.

At the start of the loop execution, `j` must be initialized to 0 since it is the first value in the range. Additionally, `dp` should reflect potentially meaningful counts for the previous indices up to `i - 1`, but since this information isn't defined specifically in the problem, we will keep `dp` in its current state.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `dp` reflects the counts for the previous indices, `i` is `len(nums)`, `j` is 0**
