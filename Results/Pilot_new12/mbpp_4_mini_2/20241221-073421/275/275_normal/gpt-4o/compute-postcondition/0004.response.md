In the given code, `dp` is assigned a new list that has the same length as `nums`, with all elements initialized to 1. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers, the length of `nums` is known, but the specific integers within it do not influence the creation of `dp`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, with all elements initialized to 1.**
