According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop is set to iterate `j` from `0` to `i-1`, which means for the loop to execute at least once, `i` must be greater than `0`. Given that `i` is currently equal to `len(nums)` and `nums` contains at least one element, `i` is guaranteed to be at least `1`. Thus, the loop will execute.

At the start of the loop, `j` will begin at `0`, and `dp[j]` will reference the maximum count of divisible integers from `nums` for `j = 0`, which corresponds to `nums[0]`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `i` is `len(nums)`, `j` is 0, and `dp[j]` represents the count of divisible integers related to `nums[0]`**
