Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `dp` contains the length of the longest divisible subset for each index, and `dp[i]` reflects the maximum count of divisible elements ending at index `i`. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `i` is 0), `dp` remains all zeros since no calculations can occur.**
