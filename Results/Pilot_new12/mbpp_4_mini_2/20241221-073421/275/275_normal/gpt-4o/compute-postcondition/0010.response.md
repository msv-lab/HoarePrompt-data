According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i`. The loop runs with `j` iterating from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0, which means the loop has run for all indices from 0 to `i - 1`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, thereby allowing `j` to reach the next value, which would be `j = i`. This means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to allow a new value of `j` to be in the range of the loop's execution criteria.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that contains at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, `i` must be greater than 1 (to allow subsequent iterations), and `j` is 0.**
