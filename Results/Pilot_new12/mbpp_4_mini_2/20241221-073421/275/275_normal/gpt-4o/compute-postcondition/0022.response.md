According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will iterate for each value of `j` from 0 up to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `len(nums)` and `j` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1, which would exceed the current value of `len(nums)`.

However, since `j` starts from 0 and increments by 1, the next value for `j` when the loop executes again would be 1. So, to ensure the loop can execute again, `i` must be equal to `len(nums) + 1`, which means the loop condition must allow for `j` to reach this new value.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `i` is `len(nums) + 1`, `j` is 1**
