The value of `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. Since `j` is less than `i` and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it indicates that the current `i` can extend the sequence counted by `dp[j]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `dp` reflects the counts for the previous indices, `i` is `len(nums)`, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is updated based on the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `dp` has been updated such that `dp[i]` is now max(`dp[i]`, `dp[j] + 1`), `i` is `len(nums)`, `j` is 0**.
