The assignment updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `index j` was set equal to `i`, this means that `dp[i]` will either remain the same or get incremented by one based on the existing value of `dp[j]`. 

Given that `j` is equal to `i`, we can analyze the effect:
- If `dp[i]` is currently less than `dp[i] + 1`, then it will be updated to `dp[i] + 1`, which means it will become one greater than its original value.
- If `dp[i]` is already greater than or equal to `dp[i] + 1`, then it will remain unchanged.

Hence, `dp[i]` will either be `dp[i])` or `dp[i] + 1`.

In terms of the other variables:
- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers containing at least one element.
- `index j` continues to equal `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `j` is `i`, and `dp[i]` is either its original value or `dp[i] + 1`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `j` is `i`, and `dp[i]` is either `dp[i]` or `dp[i] + 1`.**
