In the given code, the value `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. The variable `j` is equal to `i`, so the computation simplifies to finding the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[i] + 1`. Since `dp[i] + 1` is always greater than `dp[i]` itself (assuming `dp[i]` is not negative), the value of `dp[i]` will be updated to `dp[i] + 1`. Also, since the loop cannot execute again, the state regarding `j` remains unchanged as it cannot be less than `i`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `j` is equal to `i`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `dp[i] + 1`**.
