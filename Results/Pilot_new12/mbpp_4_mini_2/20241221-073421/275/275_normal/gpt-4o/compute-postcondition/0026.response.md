In this scenario, `dp[i]` is being updated based on the maximum value between its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `i` is greater than 1, `dp[i]` is likely being adjusted based on the prior computed values in the dynamic programming table. The value of `j` is equal to `i`, which means that `dp[j]` and `dp[i]` refer to the same index in the `dp` array.

Given that `dp[i]` is being capped to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, we restate that `dp[j]` is equivalent to `dp[i]`. Thus, `dp[i]` can either stay the same or be incremented by 1.

With all this in mind, the output state after executing the code snippet is:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element.
- `i` is greater than 1.
- `j` is `i`.
- `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[i] + 1)`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is `i`, and `dp[i]` is either the same or incremented by 1.**
