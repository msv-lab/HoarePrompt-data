Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, and `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. If `nums[i]` is not divisible by `nums[j]`, the values remain unchanged since there is no else part defined.***
