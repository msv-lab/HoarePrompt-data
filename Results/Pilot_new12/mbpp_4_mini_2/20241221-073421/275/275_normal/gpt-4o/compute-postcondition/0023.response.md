To analyze the impact of the code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, we start by looking at the initial conditions provided:

1. `nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element (the contents of the list don't affect our calculations directly).
2. `i` is `len(nums) + 1`, meaning `i` is one more than the length of the `nums` list.
3. `j` is initialized to `1`.

Now, we'll focus on the line of code given:

- The code assigns a value to `dp[i]`, taking the maximum of its current value `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. 
- Since `j` is `1`, it means we are accessing `dp[1]`.
- `dp[i]` will be updated based on the comparison between its current value and the value of `dp[1] + 1`.

We do not have specific values for `dp[i]` or `dp[j]`, but we can express their relationship:

- The value of `dp[i]` will either remain the same or increase by 1, depending on the value of `dp[1]`.

The output state summarizes the following:

- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers.
- `i` remains `len(nums) + 1`.
- `j` is still `1`.
- The new value of `dp[i]` is now either unchanged or increased by 1 based on the maximum function.

Therefore, we can express everything like this:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is len(nums) + 1, `j` is 1, and `dp[i]` is max(dp[i], dp[1] + 1)**.
