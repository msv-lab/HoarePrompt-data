According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `j` and `i`. The loop runs as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, which will make `j` equal to 1. 

Since `i` is greater than 1, `j` can be equal to 1 in the next iteration, and the loop will be executed again.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that contains at least one element, `dp` is a list of length equal to `nums`, `i` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1**
