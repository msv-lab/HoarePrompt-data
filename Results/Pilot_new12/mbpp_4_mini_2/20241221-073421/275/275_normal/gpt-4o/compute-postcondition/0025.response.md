According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop with index `j` will iterate while `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, and we can infer that `i` is a value representing the current index in `nums`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0, and the value of `j` will start from 0 and go up to `i - 1`. So if we are looking to execute the loop one more time, `i` must be at least 2 to ensure that the range of `j` will include 0 and 1. Therefore, after the last iteration where `j` reached `i-1`, `j` will need to be incremented by 1, and the loop body will execute again if `i` is still valid.

Given that `j` is currently `i - 1`, we will increment `j` to `i` in the next iteration. The state for the loop to execute a next time will thus reflect that `j` is now `i`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers containing at least one element, `i` is greater than 1, `j` is `i`, and `dp[i]` is updated according to the condition.**
