In this code snippet, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`. The elements in the array `dp` are expected to store counts or lengths, and since `i` is greater than 1, we can safely assume that accessing `dp[i]` is valid. Similarly, since `j` is 1, access to `dp[j]` is also valid.

1. The value at `dp[j]` will be fetched.
2. `dp[j] + 1` is calculated.
3. The comparison is made between the current `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.
4. If `dp[j] + 1` is greater, `dp[i]` will be updated to this new value.

Since we have not been provided with specific values for `dp[i]` or `dp[j]`, we will note that `dp[i]` could either retain its original value or be updated based on the current state of `dp[j]`.

Furthermore, no other variables are affected by this operation apart from `dp[i]`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that contains at least one element, `dp` is updated such that `dp[i]` is equal to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` where `j` is 1 and `i` is greater than 1; `i` is greater than 1, and `j` is 1.**
