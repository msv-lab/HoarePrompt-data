The function accepts a list of integers `nums`. If the list is empty, it returns 0. If the list is non-empty, it sorts the list and calculates the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element. The function then returns the maximum length found among these subsets. The function effectively handles the case where `nums` might be empty and proceeds with calculations only when there are elements to work with. The code accurately computes the required value based on the given logic, with all necessary conditions addressed.
