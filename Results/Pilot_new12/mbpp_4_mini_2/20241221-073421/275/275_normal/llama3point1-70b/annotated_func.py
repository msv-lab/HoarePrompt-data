#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the list `nums` is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a non-empty list of integers.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, where `dp[i]` is at least 1 and is updated according to the divisibility conditions with respect to previous elements in `nums`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp`, which contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets corresponding to each element in the sorted list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums`. If the list is empty, it returns 0. If the list is non-empty, it sorts the list and calculates the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element. The function then returns the maximum length found among these subsets. The function effectively handles the case where `nums` might be empty and proceeds with calculations only when there are elements to work with. The code accurately computes the required value based on the given logic, with all necessary conditions addressed.
