The value of `dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between its current value `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. The previous values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` will dictate the outcome. The states of the other variables are not affected. The new value of `dp[i]` will either remain the same or increase by 1, depending on if `dp[j]` is greater than `dp[i] - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, `dp` has at least the same length as `nums`, `i` is at least 2, `j` is 0, and `dp[i]` is updated to be max(`dp[i]`, `dp[j] + 1`).
