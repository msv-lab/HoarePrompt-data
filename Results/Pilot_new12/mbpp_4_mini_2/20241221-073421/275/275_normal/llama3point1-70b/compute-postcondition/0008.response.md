The code updates the value of `dp[i]` by comparing its current value with `dp[j] + 1`. The current value of `dp[i]` will remain unchanged if it is larger than `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, it is updated to `dp[j] + 1`. Given that both `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` initially contain only 1s (i.e., `dp[i]` is 1 and `dp[j]` is 1), `dp[j] + 1` evaluates to 2. Therefore, `dp[i]` will be updated to 2.

The relevant states of the other variables remain unchanged, with `nums`, `i`, `j` keeping their initial state as described.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `dp` is a list of integers where `dp[i]` is now 2 and `dp[j]` remains 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.**
