The `nums.sort()` method sorts the list `nums` in place. Since `nums` is a non-empty list of integers, its elements will be rearranged in ascending order. The contents of the list `nums` change, but the nature that it contains integers remains the same after the operation. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the sorted order of `nums`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers**
