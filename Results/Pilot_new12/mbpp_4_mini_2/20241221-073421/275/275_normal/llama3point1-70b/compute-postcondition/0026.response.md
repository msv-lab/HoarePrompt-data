The statement `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` assigns the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` to `dp[i]`. The variable `j` is currently equal to 1, meaning `dp[j]` refers to `dp[1]`. The initial state confirms that `i` is greater than its current value, which means `i` will refer to an index larger than 1.

- If `dp[i]` has a value greater than or equal to `dp[1] + 1`, it remains unchanged after the operation.
- If `dp[i]` is less than `dp[1] + 1`, it will be updated to `dp[1] + 1`.

Thus, `dp[i]` becomes the highest value between its original value and `dp[1] + 1`.

As `nums` is a sorted list of integers and `j` is set to 1, we acknowledge that the original contents of the list impact the values stored in `dp`.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers; `j` is 1; `i` is greater than its current value; `dp[i]` is updated to max(dp[i], dp[1] + 1)**
