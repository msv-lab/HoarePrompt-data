Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, `dp` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, for all valid indices `i`. The value of `dp[i]` is at least 1, and it is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for each `j` where `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If no such `j` exists, `dp[i]` remains 1.**
