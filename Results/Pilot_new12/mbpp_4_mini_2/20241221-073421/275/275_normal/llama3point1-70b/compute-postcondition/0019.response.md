Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, `dp` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, where `i` is 2 and `j` can be 0 or 1. The current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.***
