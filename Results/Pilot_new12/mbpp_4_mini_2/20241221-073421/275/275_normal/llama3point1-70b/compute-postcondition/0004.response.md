The code initializes `dp` as a list containing the value `1` for each element in `nums`, meaning that the length of `dp` equals the length of `nums`. The initial state describes `nums` as a sorted list of integers, which does not change the value of `nums` but affects `dp`. The output state will reflect this assignment without altering the other preconditions. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of integers where each element is 1, with length equal to `len(nums)`**
