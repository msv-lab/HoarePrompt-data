The code assigns the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1` to `dp[i]`. The initial conditions state that `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, which does not change. The variable `i` must be at least 1 greater than its current value, meaning `i` is now valid for the assignment to occur. The value of `dp[j]` is unknown but is used in the calculation. 

Since `dp[i]` may be updated based on the comparison of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`, we conclude that `dp[i]` will either remain the same or be increased to `dp[j] + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected, so we ensure to include all relevant details. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, `dp` has at least the same length as `nums`, `i` is at least 1 greater than its previous value, and `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.**
