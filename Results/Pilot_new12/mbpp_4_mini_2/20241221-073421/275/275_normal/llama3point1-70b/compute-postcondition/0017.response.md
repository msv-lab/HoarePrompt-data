According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the length of `nums`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `len(nums) - 1`. Given that `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, the loop has executed for `i` corresponding to the previous iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since `nums` has at least 2 integers, it means that the value of `i` can be incremented to 2 for the next iteration. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is adjusted to 2, and the loop will stop when `i` reaches `len(nums)`, hence `len(nums)` must be at least 3 to ensure the loop can execute again.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, `dp` is a list where each element at index `i` contains the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, for all valid indices `i`, and `i` is 2.**
