According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates `j` from 0 to `i-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value greater than or equal to 2 because `nums` contains at least 2 integers. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented, which means `j` will take on the values from 0 up to `i-1`, with `j` having the maximum value of `i-1` in the last completed iteration.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` must be incremented to at least 3, allowing `j` to take the values 0, 1, and possibly 2 if `i` was initially 2. Since `nums` is specified to have at least 2 integers, the loop can execute again with `j` set to `i - 1`, which means `j` will be equal to the new value of `i - 1`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, `dp` is a list of integers where if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is set to 2 while `dp[j]` remains 1, `i` is incremented by 1 (where `i` is now at least 3) and `j` is 2 if the previous `i` was 2.**
