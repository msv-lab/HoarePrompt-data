The expression `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` means that the value at index `i` of the list `dp` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the value at index `j` plus 1. This means that the value of `dp[i]` is updated based on the value of `dp[j]`. 

However, we do not know the previous values of `dp[i]` or `dp[j]`, except that `i` must be greater than its current value, meaning that the indices being accessed are valid. 

This code updates the state of `dp[i]`, but without knowing the specific previous values, we cannot define exact numbers. Other variables like `nums`, `j`, and the condition for `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, `j` is 0, `i` is greater than its current value; `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
