According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is still a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers. Since the loop variable `j` starts at 0 and goes up to `i - 1`, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1, meaning we need to update `j` to `i - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 0, and `i` must be one more than its current value to allow further iterations.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, `j` is 0, `i` must be greater than its current value.**
