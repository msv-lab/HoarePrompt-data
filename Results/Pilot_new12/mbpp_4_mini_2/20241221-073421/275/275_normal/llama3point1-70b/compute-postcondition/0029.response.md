According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `nums`. The loop runs from `i = 1` to `len(nums) - 1`, which means for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(nums)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, and `i` is at least 1. If `nums` has at least 3 integers, then `len(nums)` is at least 3, and consequently, `i` can go up to 2 for the loop to execute again.

In the next iteration, `i` would be incremented by 1, hence `i` will be 2. The loop can execute again as long as `len(nums)` is greater than 2.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, `dp[i]` is the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`, `i` is 2**
