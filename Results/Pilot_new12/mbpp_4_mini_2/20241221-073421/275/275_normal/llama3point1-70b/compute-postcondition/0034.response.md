According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from `0` to `i - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` must be such that `j` can take values from `0` to `i - 1`. Given that `nums` has at least 3 integers and `dp` is at least the same length as `nums`, we need to determine the conditions for the next iteration.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than the current value of `j`. Since we do not change `i` within the loop, we can conclude that `i` must be at least `j + 1` after the last iteration.

Assuming `j` is currently at `i - 1`, in order for the loop to iterate again, `i` must increase by at least 1, meaning `i` must now be at least `j + 1`. Thus, `i` should be incremented by 1, making the new value `i` equal to `current value of i + 1`.

Therefore, the required adjustments are:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, `dp` has at least the same length as `nums`, `i` must be at least 1 greater than its current value.**
