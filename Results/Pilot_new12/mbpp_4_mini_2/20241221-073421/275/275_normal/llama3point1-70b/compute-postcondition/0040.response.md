Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, `dp` has at least the same length as `nums`, `dp[2]` is the length of the longest divisible subset that ends with `nums[2]`, based on the values of `dp[j]` for `j` in {0, 1} such that `nums[2]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.**
