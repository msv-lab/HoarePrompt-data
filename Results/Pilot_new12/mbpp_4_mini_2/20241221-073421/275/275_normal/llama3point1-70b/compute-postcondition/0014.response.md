The statement `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` indicates that the value of `dp[i]` is updated to either its current value or the value of `dp[j] + 1`, depending on which is larger.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers (this is still valid),
- `i` is at least 3,
- `j` must be 3.

This implies that both `i` and `j` already meet their respective conditions, and the value of `dp[j]` must also be valid because it is being accessed as part of the assignment.

The output state needs to reflect the possible changes to `dp[i]` while retaining the conditions that were initially valid.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is at least 3, `j` is 3, and `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.**
