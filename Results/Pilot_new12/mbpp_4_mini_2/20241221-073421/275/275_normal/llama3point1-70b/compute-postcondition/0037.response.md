According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i`. The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `i-1`. Since `i` is at least 1 greater than its previous value, it is currently greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least 2, allowing `j` to take the values of `0` and `1`.

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` is at least 1 greater than its previous value and `nums` must have at least 3 integers, we can conclude that `j` can be at most `i - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be at least 2 and `j` will take the value of `0` for the next iteration.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, `dp` has at least the same length as `nums`, `i` is at least 2, and `j` is 0**
