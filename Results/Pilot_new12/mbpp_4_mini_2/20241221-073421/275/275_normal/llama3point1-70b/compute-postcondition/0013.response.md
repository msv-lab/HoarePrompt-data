According to the code, the loop iterates based on the variable `j`, which ranges from 0 to `i-1`. The loop will execute again as long as `j` is less than `i`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is at least 3, which means the variable `j` will take on values from 0 up to 2 in the previous iteration (since `j` can take values 0, 1, and 2). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented to 3 (the next value, as it runs from 0 to `i-1`).

That means for the loop to execute again, `j` must be 3, and correspondingly, `i` still can be at least 3, since it is not being changed by the loop itself.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is at least 3, `j` must be 3**
