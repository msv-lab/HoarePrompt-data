Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 integers, `dp` has at least the same length as `nums`, `i` is at least 2, and `j` is 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. Otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged.***
