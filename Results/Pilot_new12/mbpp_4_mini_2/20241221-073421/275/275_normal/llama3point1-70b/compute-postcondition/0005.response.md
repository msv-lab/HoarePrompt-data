According to the code, the loop starts with `i` initialized to 1 and iterates while `i` is less than `len(nums)`. To ensure the loop can execute, `len(nums)` must be greater than 1. The elements `nums` and `dp` are already set, and `i` will start at 1. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nums` must be a sorted list containing at least 2 integers, and `i` is initially 1. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `dp` is a list of integers with each element as 1 and length equal to `len(nums)`, `i` is 1**
