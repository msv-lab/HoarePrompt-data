To assess the provided program against the problem description, let's closely examine the logic of the function `func_1`.

The function aims to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. Here's how it works:

1. It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty, returning 0 if it is.
2. Then, it sorts the list of numbers.
3. The `dp` (dynamic programming) array is initialized to contain `1`s, indicating that every number can at least form a subset of size 1 by itself.
4. It uses a nested loop to compare each number with previous numbers to check if they are divisible.
5. If a number `nums[i]` is divisible by another number `nums[j]`, it tries to update the maximum size of the subset that can include `nums[i]`.

Here's a potential issue to consider:

Imagine the input list is `[3, 6, 9]`. 
- The expected largest subset is `[3, 6]` or `[3, 9]`, both of size 2. 
- However, when the function processes this input, it will reach `nums[i] = 6` and check for `nums[0] = 3`, confirming that `6 % 3 == 0` and updating `dp[1]` to `2`. The next comparison with `nums[2] = 9` will show it's not divisible by `3` and will not contribute to `dp`.

This gives a final `dp` of `[1, 2, 2]`, and `max(dp)` will yield `2`, which seems correct.

However, if we take the input list as `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
- The expected largest subset is `[1, 2, 4]`, which should have a size of 3.
- But, the current loops do not handle cases where the first item in the list (which can divide all numbers) might not be situated correctly.

Therefore, a critical examination reveals that the program does not ensure that all pairs in the considered subset are divisible, especially with respect to leading non-dividing elements.

Thus, it can fail when the input numbers don't start correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
