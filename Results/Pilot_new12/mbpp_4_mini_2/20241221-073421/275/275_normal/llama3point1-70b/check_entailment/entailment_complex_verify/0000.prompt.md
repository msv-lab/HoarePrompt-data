You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the provided program against the problem description, let's closely examine the logic of the function `func_1`.

The function aims to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair in the subset is divisible. Here's how it works:

1. It first checks if the input list `nums` is empty, returning 0 if it is.
2. Then, it sorts the list of numbers.
3. The `dp` (dynamic programming) array is initialized to contain `1`s, indicating that every number can at least form a subset of size 1 by itself.
4. It uses a nested loop to compare each number with previous numbers to check if they are divisible.
5. If a number `nums[i]` is divisible by another number `nums[j]`, it tries to update the maximum size of the subset that can include `nums[i]`.

Here's a potential issue to consider:

Imagine the input list is `[3, 6, 9]`. 
- The expected largest subset is `[3, 6]` or `[3, 9]`, both of size 2. 
- However, when the function processes this input, it will reach `nums[i] = 6` and check for `nums[0] = 3`, confirming that `6 % 3 == 0` and updating `dp[1]` to `2`. The next comparison with `nums[2] = 9` will show it's not divisible by `3` and will not contribute to `dp`.

This gives a final `dp` of `[1, 2, 2]`, and `max(dp)` will yield `2`, which seems correct.

However, if we take the input list as `[1, 2, 3, 4]`:
- The expected largest subset is `[1, 2, 4]`, which should have a size of 3.
- But, the current loops do not handle cases where the first item in the list (which can divide all numbers) might not be situated correctly.

Therefore, a critical examination reveals that the program does not ensure that all pairs in the considered subset are divisible, especially with respect to leading non-dividing elements.

Thus, it can fail when the input numbers don't start correctly.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as the list `nums` is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a non-empty list of integers.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element in `nums`, where `dp[i]` is at least 1 and is updated according to the divisibility conditions with respect to previous elements in `nums`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the list `dp`, which contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsets corresponding to each element in the sorted list `nums`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums`. If the list is empty, it returns 0. If the list is non-empty, it sorts the list and calculates the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element. The function then returns the maximum length found among these subsets. The function effectively handles the case where `nums` might be empty and proceeds with calculations only when there are elements to work with. The code accurately computes the required value based on the given logic, with all necessary conditions addressed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
