Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair of numbers within this subset is divisible by one another. It begins by checking if the input list `nums` is empty, returning 0 in that case, which is appropriate per the problem description. When the list is non-empty, it sorts the numbers and utilizes dynamic programming to calculate the longest divisible subset for each number in the sorted list. The use of `dp[i]` to track the length of the longest subset ending at index `i` ensures that we correctly count the divisible relationships. The program finally returns the maximum length found, which accurately reflects the requirements of the problem statement. 

All necessary conditions and potential edge cases are handled efficiently within the logic of the provided code. Hence, the program is considered correct for all valid inputs.
