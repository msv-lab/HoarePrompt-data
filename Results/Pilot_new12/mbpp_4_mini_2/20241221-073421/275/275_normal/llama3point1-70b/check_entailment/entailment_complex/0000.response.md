The program appears to correctly implement the required functionality based on the provided problem description. Here is the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The program starts by checking if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns `0`, which is appropriate for the case when there are no numbers to evaluate. This aligns with the requirement, as an empty list cannot have any subsets.

2. **Sorting the List**: The function then sorts the list `nums`. This is necessary because, to find a subset where every pair is divisible, it often helps to consider elements in order from smallest to largest. This approach ensures that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` where `j < i`, then all combinations where `j` comes before `i` in the sorted list will be checked appropriately.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The dynamic programming array `dp` is initialized with `1`, indicating that each number can form a subset of at least itself. The nested loop structure then compares each number `nums[i]` with all previous numbers `nums[j]`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` with at least one more length than `dp[j]`, effectively building up the length of the longest divisible subsets.

4. **Result Calculation**: Finally, the program returns the maximum value found in `dp`, which correctly reflects the size of the largest subset where every pair of members is divisible.

Based on the structure and logic of the program, it systematically fulfills all necessary aspects of the problem description, including edge cases, logical comparisons, and producing the correct result based on the input.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **True**
