Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. 

### Explanation:
1. **Handling Empty List**: The function starts by checking if the list `nums` is empty, and if so, it returns 0. This correctly addresses the case when there are no numbers to evaluate.

2. **Sorting**: The function sorts the list of integers in ascending order. This step is necessary as it allows the inner loop to correctly evaluate divisibility. For any number `nums[i]`, if it is divisible by a preceding number `nums[j]`, then `j` must be less than `i` in a sorted list.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The program utilizes a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the maximum size of the divisible subset that ends with `nums[i]`. The nested loops correctly update the `dp` values based on the divisibility condition.

4. **Finding the Maximum Subset Size**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

5. **Summary of Edge Cases**: The output hints confirm that the main cases are handled correctly, including the empty list case. There are no indications that the program fails for any valid test cases.

Since the program adheres to the problem description for all potential cases, it is deemed correct.
