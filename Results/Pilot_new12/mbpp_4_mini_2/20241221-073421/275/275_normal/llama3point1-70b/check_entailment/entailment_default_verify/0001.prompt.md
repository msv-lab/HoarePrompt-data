You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program that aims to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible, let's analyze the code.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Empty Input Handling**: The code correctly returns 0 for an empty list (`if not nums: return 0`).

2. **Sorting**: It sorts the input list, which is necessary for finding divisibility because it allows the use of the dynamic programming approach effectively (smaller numbers come first).

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: It initializes a list `dp` where each position `i` starts with a value of 1, assuming that each number can at least form a subset with itself.

4. **Nested Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates through the sorted list.
   - The inner loop checks for each previous number if the current number can be added to the subset that includes the number at position `j` if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

5. **Updating Subset Size**: It updates `dp[i]` to account for the largest subset size that can include `nums[i]`.

6. **Result**: The function finally returns the maximum value from the `dp` array.

### Edge Case Analysis:
- The program appears to be logically sound and generally handles multiple cases.
- However, consider an edge case: **a list of prime numbers**. For example, if the input is `[3, 5, 7]`, each number is a prime and cannot divide one another. The expected output would be `1` (each number alone forms the largest subset), which the program handles correctly by returning `1`.

### Further Edge Cases:
- For a single element list, e.g., `[10]`, the resultant output will correctly return `1`.
- For a list with duplicates or zeros, such as `[0, 0, 3]`, the maximum divisible subset that includes zeros leads again to a subset of valid size `2` or `1` respectively, which the code will evaluate correctly.
  
### Conclusion:
After considering a variety of potential inputs, including edge cases of both small and specific configurations like primes or zero entries, the program consistently returns the expected result.

Therefore, I conclude with:

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly implements the requirements to find the largest subset of divisible numbers across various cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers `nums`. If the list is empty, it returns 0. If the list is non-empty, it sorts the list and calculates the lengths of the longest divisible subsets for each element. The function then returns the maximum length found among these subsets. The function effectively handles the case where `nums` might be empty and proceeds with calculations only when there are elements to work with. The code accurately computes the required value based on the given logic, with all necessary conditions addressed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
