To determine the correctness of the provided Python program that aims to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible, let's analyze the code.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Empty Input Handling**: The code correctly returns 0 for an empty list (`if not nums: return 0`).

2. **Sorting**: It sorts the input list, which is necessary for finding divisibility because it allows the use of the dynamic programming approach effectively (smaller numbers come first).

3. **Dynamic Programming Array**: It initializes a list `dp` where each position `i` starts with a value of 1, assuming that each number can at least form a subset with itself.

4. **Nested Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates through the sorted list.
   - The inner loop checks for each previous number if the current number can be added to the subset that includes the number at position `j` if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

5. **Updating Subset Size**: It updates `dp[i]` to account for the largest subset size that can include `nums[i]`.

6. **Result**: The function finally returns the maximum value from the `dp` array.

### Edge Case Analysis:
- The program appears to be logically sound and generally handles multiple cases.
- However, consider an edge case: **a list of prime numbers**. For example, if the input is `[3, 5, 7]`, each number is a prime and cannot divide one another. The expected output would be `1` (each number alone forms the largest subset), which the program handles correctly by returning `1`.

### Further Edge Cases:
- For a single element list, e.g., `[10]`, the resultant output will correctly return `1`.
- For a list with duplicates or zeros, such as `[0, 0, 3]`, the maximum divisible subset that includes zeros leads again to a subset of valid size `2` or `1` respectively, which the code will evaluate correctly.
  
### Conclusion:
After considering a variety of potential inputs, including edge cases of both small and specific configurations like primes or zero entries, the program consistently returns the expected result.

Therefore, I conclude with:

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly implements the requirements to find the largest subset of divisible numbers across various cases.
