Correctness: **True**.

The provided program defines a function that correctly identifies even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to check each number in the input list and includes it in the output list if it is even (i.e., if `num % 2 == 0` evaluates to `True`). 

All possible inputs, including empty lists and lists containing non-integer types, do not affect the correctness of the function as the program will return an empty list for an empty input and ignore non-integer values without raising an error (though this might not align with stricter interpretations, it does not lead to incorrect behavior for the problem description). All integers, both negative and positive, are handled accurately by the modulo operation for evenness.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description for all potential inputs.
