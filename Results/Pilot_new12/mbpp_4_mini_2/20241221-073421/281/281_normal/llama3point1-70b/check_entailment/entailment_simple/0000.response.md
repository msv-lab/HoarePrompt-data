Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and uses a list comprehension to filter out even numbers from that list. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input:** The input to the function is a list of integers, which aligns with the precondition stated in the annotations.
2. **Processing:** The program uses `num % 2 == 0` to check if each number in the list is even. This modulus operation accurately identifies even integers.
3. **Output:** The function returns a new list containing only the even integers found in the input list, which is exactly what the problem description specifies.

Since the program consistently performs the required action—producing a list of even integers from a provided list of integers—it fulfills the problem's requirements and is therefore correct.
