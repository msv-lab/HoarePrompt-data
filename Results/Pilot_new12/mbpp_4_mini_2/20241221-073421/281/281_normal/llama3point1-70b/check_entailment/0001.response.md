Correctness: **True**

The program correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from the input list, adhering to the problem description. It uses a list comprehension that checks each number for evenness by evaluating whether the number modulo 2 equals zero. 

For any input list of integers, the code will function correctly:
- If the list is empty, it will return an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
- For a list containing only odd numbers, it will also correctly return an empty list.
- For a list with both even and odd numbers, it will return only the even numbers as specified.

Thus, there are no inputs or potential edge cases that the program fails to handle according to the problem description. Hence, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
