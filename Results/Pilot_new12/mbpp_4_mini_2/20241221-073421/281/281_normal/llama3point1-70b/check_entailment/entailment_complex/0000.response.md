Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(numbers)` correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate through the provided list `numbers` and checks each integer (`num`) to see if it is even (i.e., if `num % 2 == 0`). If the number is even, it includes that number in the resulting list. 

According to the problem description, the function should return a list of even integers from the input list, and it does so effectively. Additionally, the function is designed to return an empty list if the input list is empty, which aligns with the expectations outlined in the problem description.

Since the function assumes valid input, any potential issues with input type (such as non-lists or non-integer values) are not considered given the assumption. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description for valid inputs.

Overall, the implementation fulfills the stated purpose accurately, making it correct as per the requirements.
