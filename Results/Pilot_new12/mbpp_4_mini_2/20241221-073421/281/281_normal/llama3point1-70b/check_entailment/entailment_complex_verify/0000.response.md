Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately determines the correctness of the program. The program correctly identifies even numbers from a list of integers, which aligns with the problem description. The annotations confirm that, given a proper list of integers, the function will return a list of even integers, handling empty lists correctly by returning an empty list.

The annotations do point out that the function does not handle non-integer types or checks for the input type being a list. However, per the instructions, we assume the input will always be valid and meet the preconditions of being a list of integers. Thus, the absence of error handling for invalid inputs does not affect the correctness for the specified problem description.

Overall, since the program's functionality meets the requirements described and the annotations support this, the original assessment remains accurate. Therefore, the final assessment confirms that the program is correct.
