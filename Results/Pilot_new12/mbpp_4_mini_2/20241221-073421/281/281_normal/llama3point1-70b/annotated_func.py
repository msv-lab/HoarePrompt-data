#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list containing all even integers from the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers, and returns a list containing all even integers from the input list. If the input list is empty, the function will return an empty list. The function does not handle any errors or exceptions related to the input type, so if a non-list or a list containing non-integer types is provided, it may lead to unexpected behavior.
