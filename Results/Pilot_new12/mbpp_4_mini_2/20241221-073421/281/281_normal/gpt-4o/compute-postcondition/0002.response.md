Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. It returns a list containing all the even integers from that list. If the input list is empty or contains no even integers, the function will return an empty list. Note that the function only filters out even integers and does not handle any additional functionality or edge cases such as input validation or handling of non-integer types.**
