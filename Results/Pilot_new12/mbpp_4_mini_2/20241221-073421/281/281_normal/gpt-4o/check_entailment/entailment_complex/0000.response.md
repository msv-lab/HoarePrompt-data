Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly implements the specified functionality of finding even numbers from a given list. Here's why it meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single parameter `numbers`, which is specified to be a list of integers. The problem description assumes valid input, and the implementation correctly works under this assumption.

2. **Return Value**: The function returns a list that contains all even integers from the input list. The implementation uses a list comprehension to filter out even numbers, where an even number is identified using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. This criterion correctly identifies all even numbers.

3. **Test Cases**: The assert statements provided confirm that the function performs correctly for multiple test cases:
   - For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output is `[2, 4]`, which correctly identifies the even numbers.
   - For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, the output is `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, which includes all even numbers.
   - For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, the output is `[8, 12]`, which correctly filters even integers.

4. **Edge Cases**: Although the program does not explicitly handle edge cases (like empty lists or lists without even numbers), the problem description does not require any additional functionality beyond returning even numbers. The function will simply return an empty list in such cases, which is an acceptable behavior according to the problem description.

Since the implementation aligns with the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
