Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that correctly filters even numbers from a list of integers. The code provided fulfills the requirements of the problem description, which states that the function should return a list of even integers from the given input list. 

The test cases in the assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the provided examples:

1. For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function returns `[2, 4]`, which are the even numbers.
2. For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, it returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, correctly identifying all even numbers, including zero.
3. For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, it returns `[8, 12]`, also correctly filtering even numbers.

The output hints clarify that the function will return an empty list if there are no even integers or if the input list is empty. Since it correctly handles these scenarios according to the provided specifications and assumptions, the function is deemed correct. 

Moreover, since the program assumes valid inputs (i.e., a list of integers without needing additional validation), it aligns with the expected behavior as stated in the problem description and output hints.

Thus, there are no cases found where the program fails, confirming that it meets all requirements consistently.
