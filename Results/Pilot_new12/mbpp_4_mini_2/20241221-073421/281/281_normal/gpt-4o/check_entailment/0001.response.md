Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find even numbers from a list of numbers. It uses a list comprehension to filter out numbers that are even (i.e., numbers where `num % 2 == 0`). 

The assertions provided are also valid test cases that demonstrate the function's expected behavior:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `[2, 4]`, which are the even numbers from the input list.
2. `func_1([4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1])` returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`, correctly identifying all even numbers in the list.
3. `func_1([8, 12, 15, 19])` returns `[8, 12]`, which are the even numbers in this list.

All cases demonstrate the function works as intended and matches the problem description. Since I cannot think of any input where the function fails to return the expected result, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
