Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's the explanation:

1. The function `func_1(numbers)` takes a list of integers as input.
2. It uses list comprehension to iterate through the provided list and checks if each number is even using the condition `num % 2 == 0`.
3. If the number is even, it is included in the returned list.
4. The function returns a list of all even integers from the input list, which aligns directly with the problem requirement of finding even numbers from a list.

The provided test assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected, yielding the correct list of even numbers for the inputs given. Thus, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases mentioned, given the assumption that the input will always be valid (a list of integers).
