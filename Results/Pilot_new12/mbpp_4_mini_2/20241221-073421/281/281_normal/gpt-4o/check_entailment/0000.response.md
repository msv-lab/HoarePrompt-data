Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` accurately implements the logic to find even numbers in a list based on the provided problem description. It utilizes a list comprehension to filter the numbers that satisfy the condition of being even (where `num % 2 == 0`). 

The example assertions provided also confirm the function's correctness for various inputs:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, it correctly returns `[2, 4]`.
- For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, it correctly returns `[4, 6, 8, 0]`.
- For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, it correctly returns `[8, 12]`.

Since the function handles different cases appropriately and adheres to the problem description without missing any potential cases, it is considered correct.
