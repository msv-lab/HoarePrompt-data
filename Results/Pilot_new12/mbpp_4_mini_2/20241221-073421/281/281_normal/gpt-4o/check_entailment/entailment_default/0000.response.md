The provided program is designed to find even numbers from a list of integers. Here's the analysis of the code based on the problem description and output hints:

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of integers. It returns a list containing all the even integers from that list. If the input list is empty or contains no even integers, the function will return an empty list. Note that the function only filters out even integers and does not handle any additional functionality or edge cases such as input validation or handling of non-integer types.

**Analysis:**
1. **Correctness Based on Problem Description:** The program seems to correctly identify even numbers in the provided examples. All the provided assertions pass, confirming that for valid integer lists, the function produces the expected output.
   
2. **Edge Cases and Assumptions:** The hints mention that the function does not handle cases such as input validation or handling of non-integer types, but it is specified that the input will be valid. Thus, under the assumption that the inputs are always valid lists of integers (including the case of an empty list), the function behaves correctly according to the described functionality.

Given that the function correctly filters out even integers and adheres to the problem description while working under the assumptions provided, I conclude that it meets the requirements in every case.

**Conclusion:** 
Correctness: **True**.
