#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the non-negative integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string to iterate over each digit, converts those string digits back to integers, and returns the sum of these integer digits. The final state of the program is that it returns a single integer value representing the total sum of the digits of `n`. The implementation correctly handles the provided input type, which is a non-negative integer, and does not include any additional error handling for edge cases such as negative numbers or non-integer inputs, which may result in a runtime error if such inputs are provided.
