Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. However, the Output hints indicate that the program does not handle cases where the input is not a non-negative integer correctly. Specifically, if negative numbers or non-integer inputs are provided, the function will raise a runtime error due to the conversion to string without any error handling. 

For example, calling `func_1(-123)` or `func_1("123")` would result in errors, which are cases that fall under the expected behavior according to the problem description. Since the function does not handle these potential cases, it does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, leading to its classification as incorrect.
