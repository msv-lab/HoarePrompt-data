Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It achieves this by converting the integer to a string to iterate through each digit, converting each character back to an integer, and then summing these integers. 

For example:
- For `n = 123`, it calculates `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
- For `n = 0`, it returns `0`.
- For `n = 4567`, it calculates `4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22`.

The implementation covers all possible non-negative integer inputs and will correctly return the sum of their digits without missing any edge cases. Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
