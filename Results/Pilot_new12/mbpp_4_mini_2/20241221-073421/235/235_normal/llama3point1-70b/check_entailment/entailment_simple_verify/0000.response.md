Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n` by converting it to a string, iterating over each character (representing a digit), converting those characters back to integers, and using the `sum` function to total them. The annotated version confirms that the program is operating under the assumption that `n` is indeed a non-negative integer, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. 

The examples provided in the assessment, such as calculating the sum of digits for inputs like `123`, `0`, and `4567`, demonstrate that the function behaves as expected in all cases outlined in the problem description. Additionally, the annotations confirm our understanding that the function fulfills its intended purpose. Thus, the program meets the requirements and correctly handles the specified task.
