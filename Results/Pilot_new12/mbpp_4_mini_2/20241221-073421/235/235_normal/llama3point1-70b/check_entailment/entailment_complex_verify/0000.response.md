Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. The annotated version of the code supports this conclusion by confirming that the function processes a non-negative integer, converts it to a string, iterates through each digit to sum them up, and returns the correct total as an integer. The annotations also align with the problem description, verifying that the function is designed to handle valid input as specified. Thus, overall, the function meets the requirements of the problem description, confirming its correctness.
