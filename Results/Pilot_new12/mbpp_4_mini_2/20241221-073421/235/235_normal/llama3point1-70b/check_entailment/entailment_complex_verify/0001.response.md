Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as it correctly identifies that the function sums the digits of a non-negative integer as required by the problem description. The annotations align with this assessment, confirming that the function operates correctly with valid input. The function takes a non-negative integer, transforms it to a string to iterate over its digits, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them effectively. The handling of edge cases, such as single-digit and multi-digit numbers, is also correctly noted in both the original assessment and annotations. Since the function adheres to the problem description without any errors related to the expected input type, the assessment stands as true.
