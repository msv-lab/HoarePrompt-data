Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to sum the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotated version of the code confirms the correctness by specifying that right before the function call, `n` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer, allowing the function to operate as intended without handling errors for invalid input types. 

The line of code `return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` effectively converts each digit in the string representation of `n` back into an integer and sums them up appropriately. The annotations support this conclusion and ensure that the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description, including handling edge cases. 

Thus, based on all evidence, the program is confirmed to be correct.
