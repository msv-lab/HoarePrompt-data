Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description, which is to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Here is an explanation of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a single parameter `n`, which is stated to be a non-negative integer. The problem explicitly details that the input will be valid and will not cause errors, removing concerns about invalid inputs.

2. **Conversion of Integer to String**: The program converts the integer `n` into a string using `str(n)`. This allows the subsequent iteration over each individual digit.

3. **Summation of Digits**: The program utilizes a generator expression `int(digit) for digit in str(n)` to iterate through each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`, converts each character back to an integer using `int(digit)`, and sums them up with `sum(...)`. 

4. **Correct Output**: The output is the total sum of the digits, which aligns with the ask of returning the sum of the digits for any non-negative integer input. 

Given that the program handles the non-negative integer correctly and produces the expected sum of its digits, it adheres to the problem description as required. Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.
