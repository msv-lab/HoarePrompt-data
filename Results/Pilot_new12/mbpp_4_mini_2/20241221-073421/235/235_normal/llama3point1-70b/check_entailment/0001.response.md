Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly sums the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's why I think the code is correct in every case:

1. **Input Type Handling**: The function takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. The program correctly converts this integer to a string to iterate over each digit.

2. **Digit Processing**: Inside the generator expression, it converts each character back to an integer with `int(digit)` and sums them up using the built-in `sum()` function.

3. **Valid for All Non-Negative Integers**:
   - For 0, it produces `0`.
   - For a single-digit number (e.g., 5), it produces `5`.
   - For multi-digit numbers (e.g., 123), it produces `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as the input being `0` or a very large non-negative integer correctly (e.g., `999999999` would return `9 * 9 = 81`).

Thus, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem description, which confirms that the program is correct.
