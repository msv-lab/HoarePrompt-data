You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly sums the digits of a non-negative integer. Here's why I think the code is correct in every case:

1. **Input Type Handling**: The function takes a single argument `n`, which is expected to be a non-negative integer. The program correctly converts this integer to a string to iterate over each digit.

2. **Digit Processing**: Inside the generator expression, it converts each character back to an integer with `int(digit)` and sums them up using the built-in `sum()` function.

3. **Valid for All Non-Negative Integers**:
   - For 0, it produces `0`.
   - For a single-digit number (e.g., 5), it produces `5`.
   - For multi-digit numbers (e.g., 123), it produces `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases such as the input being `0` or a very large non-negative integer correctly (e.g., `999999999` would return `9 * 9 = 81`).

Thus, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem description, which confirms that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, converts it to a string to iterate over each digit, converts those string digits back to integers, and returns the sum of these integer digits. The final state of the program is that it returns a single integer value representing the total sum of the digits of `n`. The implementation correctly handles the provided input type, which is a non-negative integer, and does not include any additional error handling for edge cases such as negative numbers or non-integer inputs, which may result in a runtime error if such inputs are provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
