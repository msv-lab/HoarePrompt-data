Correctness: **True**

The annotated program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It explicitly defines a function `func_1` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of its digits. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is designed to accept a non-negative integer `n`. The problem description stipulates that the input will be valid, so the function can safely operate under this assumption without additional error checking for negative values or non-integer types.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The function converts the integer to a string, allowing it to iterate over each character (digit) in that string. Each character is then converted back to an integer using `int(digit)`, and all these integer digits are summed using the built-in `sum` function.

3. **Output**: The function returns a single integer, which is the sum of the digits. This behavior aligns with the expected output based on the problem description.

Thus, since the function adheres to the specified requirements and correctly implements the logic to sum the digits of the input integer, it is considered correct.
