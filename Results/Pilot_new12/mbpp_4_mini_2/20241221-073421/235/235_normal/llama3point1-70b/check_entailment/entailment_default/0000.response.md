Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly handles the task of summing the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (which represents a digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up using the `sum` function. The output hints accurately describe this process and confirm that the function provides the correct single integer output for the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. Since negative numbers and non-integer inputs are specified as not being in the input domain, the function is considered correct under the given problem constraints.
