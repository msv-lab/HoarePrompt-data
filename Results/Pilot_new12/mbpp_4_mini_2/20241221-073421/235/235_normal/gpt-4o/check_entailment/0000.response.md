Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It works by repeatedly taking the last digit of the number (using `n % 10`) and adding it to a total sum, while removing the last digit from `n` (using `n //= 10`). 

The provided assertions pass for the cases tested:
- For `func_1(345)`, the digits are 3, 4, and 5, which sum to 12.
- For `func_1(12)`, the digits are 1 and 2, which sum to 3.
- For `func_1(97)`, the digits are 9 and 7, which sum to 16.

Additionally, since the function handles all non-negative integers correctly by iterating until `n` becomes 0 and does not have any conditions that could lead to incorrect calculation for positive integers or 0, it is reasonable to conclude that it is correct for all valid input scenarios.
