Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to sum the digits of a non-negative integer. Here is the reasoning:

1. The function uses a `while` loop to iterate through the digits of the integer `n`.
2. Each digit is obtained using the modulus operation `n % 10`, and this digit is added to the `total`.
3. The integer `n` is then divided by 10 (using integer division) to remove the last digit, and the loop continues until `n` is reduced to 0.
4. The function will correctly handle any non-negative integer input, including 0, which would return 0 as the sum of its digits.

The problem description explicitly mentions that the input is a non-negative integer. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for the tested cases. There are no edge cases that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description, as it handles the expected range of inputs adequately.

In conclusion, all potential inputs that fit the description are correctly managed by the code. Thus, the program is correct.
