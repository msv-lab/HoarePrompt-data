You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to sum the digits of a non-negative integer. Here is the reasoning:

1. The function uses a `while` loop to iterate through the digits of the integer `n`.
2. Each digit is obtained using the modulus operation `n % 10`, and this digit is added to the `total`.
3. The integer `n` is then divided by 10 (using integer division) to remove the last digit, and the loop continues until `n` is reduced to 0.
4. The function will correctly handle any non-negative integer input, including 0, which would return 0 as the sum of its digits.

The problem description explicitly mentions that the input is a non-negative integer. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for the tested cases. There are no edge cases that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description, as it handles the expected range of inputs adequately.

In conclusion, all potential inputs that fit the description are correctly managed by the code. Thus, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. The function effectively processes all non-negative integers, breaking them down digit by digit to accumulate their sum, irrespective of their length. Thus, for any valid input `n`, the output will always be a non-negative integer corresponding to the sum of the individual digits of `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
