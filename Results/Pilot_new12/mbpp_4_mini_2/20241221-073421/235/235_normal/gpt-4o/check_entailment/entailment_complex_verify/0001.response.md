Final: **True**

The program meets the problem description of summing the digits of a non-negative integer, and the annotated version supports the correctness of the program. 

The function `func_1` effectively sums the digits of any non-negative integer by using a `while` loop, updating the total with the remainder of the division by 10, and then reducing the integer by removing the last digit. The provided annotations confirm that the state of the program aligns with our expectations at key points:

1. Before the function call, `n` is identified as a non-negative integer.
2. After executing the loop, `n` is confirmed to be 0, and `total` reflects the correct summation of the digits of the original value of `n`, which aligns with the requirements of the problem statement.

The original assessment correctly highlighted that the function can handle 0 and other positive integers, producing the expected results as demonstrated by the assertions. Since the annotations align with the stated behavior and confirm that the function processes all valid inputs correctly according to the problem description, the assessment of correctness remains valid. Thus, the program is indeed correct.
