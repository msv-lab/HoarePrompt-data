Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly sums the digits of a non-negative integer as described in the problem. The reasoning is supported by the logic implemented in the function and the provided output hints.

1. The function correctly handles the input by processing each digit of the non-negative integer iteratively using a `while` loop until all digits are summed.
2. The function returns 0 when the input is 0, aligning with the specified behavior in the problem description and the output hints.
3. It addresses all valid inputs as per the problem description, with the output hints affirming that the function will produce a non-negative integer sum for valid non-negative integers.

Therefore, all aspects of the function and the assessment align with the problem requirements, leading to the conclusion that the program is indeed correct.
