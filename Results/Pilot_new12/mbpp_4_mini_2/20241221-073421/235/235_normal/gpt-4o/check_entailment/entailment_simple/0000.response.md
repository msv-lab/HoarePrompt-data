Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer, which matches the requirements set forth in the problem description. 

Here's why the function is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The `total` variable initializes to 0, which is appropriate for accumulating the sum of digits.

2. **Loop Condition**: The `while n > 0:` condition ensures that the loop runs as long as there are digits left to process in the integer `n`.

3. **Digit Extraction**: Inside the loop, `n % 10` extracts the last digit of `n`, and this value is added to `total`.

4. **Integer Division**: The operation `n //= 10` removes the last digit from `n`, effectively moving to the next digit.

5. **Return Value**: After all digits have been processed (when `n` becomes 0), the function returns `total`, which at this point contains the sum of all extracted digits.

6. **Special Case of Zero**: If the input is 0, the loop does not execute, and `total` remains 0, which correctly represents the sum of the digits of 0.

The functionality has been verified with the provided assertions, and it covers different cases of positive integers as well as the special case of zero. There are no edge cases involving negative integers or invalid input since the assumption is made that input will be valid as per the description. Thus, the implementation adheres to the problem description effectively.
