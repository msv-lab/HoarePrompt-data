Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is accurate. The function `func_1` effectively computes the sum of the digits for non-negative integers as required by the problem description. The reasoning in the original assessment correctly outlines the approach the function takes: it iteratively adds the last digit of the integer to a total sum and removes that digit until the integer becomes zero. The function handles the case of `0` correctly by returning `0`, aligning with the output hints provided.

Moreover, the output hints affirm that the function can process any non-negative integer regardless of the number of digits. The assertions validate the function against representative test cases, demonstrating that it operates as intended for the inputs given.

Thus, based on the analysis of the program, the original assessment, and the supporting output hints, the final determination of correctness is upheld.
