Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to sum the digits of a non-negative integer. The annotations support the correctness of the program as follows:

1. The annotations clearly state that the function is invoked with a non-negative integer, which aligns with the problem description.
2. As the while loop executes, it accurately calculates the sum of the digits by utilizing the modulus and integer division operations.
3. The state described after the loop confirms that `n` is reduced to 0 and `total` holds the correct sum of the digits or remains 0 if the original input was 0.
4. The provided assertions confirm the function's expected output for valid non-negative integer inputs.

Given that the function meets the problem description and the annotations substantiate the correctness of the implementation, the final assessment of the program's correctness is maintained as true.
