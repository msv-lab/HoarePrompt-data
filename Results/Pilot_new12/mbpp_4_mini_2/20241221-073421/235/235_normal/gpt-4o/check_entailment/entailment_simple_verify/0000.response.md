Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` indeed computes the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer as specified in the problem description. 

The annotations further support this conclusion by confirming the state of `n` prior to the function execution as a non-negative integer, and by outlining that the total correctly reflects the sum of the digits after the loop executes. The annotations also state that if the original value of `n` is 0, the total remains 0, which is consistent with the problem requirements since the sum of digits in that case is correctly defined as 0.

All provided assertions pass the tests for soundness, demonstrating the function's correctness with clear examples. Therefore, the function behaves as expected for all valid input scenarios.
