The provided program is designed to sum the digits of a non-negative integer. 

The function `func_1(n: int)` does the following:
1. It initializes a variable `total` to store the sum of the digits.
2. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
3. Inside the loop, it adds the last digit of `n` (obtained using `n % 10`) to `total`.
4. It then removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division by 10 (`n //= 10`).
5. Once `n` is reduced to 0, it returns `total`.

According to the output hints, the function correctly handles non-negative integers and returns the sum of their digits, including correctly returning 0 for the input `n = 0`.

From the problem description and the provided example assertions (`func_1(345)`, `func_1(12)`, and `func_1(97)`), itâ€™s clear that the function works properly for these cases, summing the digits as expected. The output hints further confirm that for any valid non-negative integer, the function consistently returns the appropriate sum.

Now, let's consider edge cases:
- For `n = 0`, the function will return `0`, which is correct since the sum of the digits of `0` is indeed `0`.
- Since the prompt states that the input will be a non-negative integer, we do not need to handle negative inputs, and the program does not show any issues in handling large non-negative integers as Python natively supports arbitrarily large integers.

Since the implementation is correct for all tested and potential valid cases (non-negative integers), the output hints are in full agreement with the function's behavior as well.

Correctness: **True**.
