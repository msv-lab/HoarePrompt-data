You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        n //= 10
    return total


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to sum the digits of a non-negative integer. Here is the reasoning:

1. The function uses a `while` loop to iterate through the digits of the integer `n`.
2. Each digit is obtained using the modulus operation `n % 10`, and this digit is added to the `total`.
3. The integer `n` is then divided by 10 (using integer division) to remove the last digit, and the loop continues until `n` is reduced to 0.
4. The function will correctly handle any non-negative integer input, including 0, which would return 0 as the sum of its digits.

The problem description explicitly mentions that the input is a non-negative integer. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for the tested cases. There are no edge cases that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description, as it handles the expected range of inputs adequately.

In conclusion, all potential inputs that fit the description are correctly managed by the code. Thus, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(345) == 12
assert func_1(12) == 3
assert func_1(97) == 16

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    total = 0
    while n > 0:
        total += n % 10
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is 0, `total` is the sum of the digits of the original value of `n`, if the original `n` was greater than 0; if the original `n` was 0, then `total` remains 0.
    return total
    #The program returns total, which remains 0 since the original value of n was 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. The function effectively processes all non-negative integers, breaking them down digit by digit to accumulate their sum, irrespective of their length. Thus, for any valid input `n`, the output will always be a non-negative integer corresponding to the sum of the individual digits of `n`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
