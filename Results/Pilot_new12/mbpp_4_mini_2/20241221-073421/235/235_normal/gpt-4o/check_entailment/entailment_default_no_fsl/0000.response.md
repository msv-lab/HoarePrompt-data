Correctness: **True** 

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It handles all non-negative integers, including 0, as stated in the problem description. The assertions provided in the code confirm that the function produces accurate results for various cases, including:

- For `345`, the sum is `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`.
- For `12`, the sum is `1 + 2 = 3`.
- For `97`, the sum is `9 + 7 = 16`.

The output hints also confirm that the function processes all non-negative integers to accurately compute the sum of their digits. Since no edge cases or potential failures are identified that contradict the problem description, the code meets the requirements consistently across all valid input cases, including n being 0, which returns a sum of 0. Therefore, the function is correctly implemented for the given task.
