Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly implements the requirement defined in the problem description, which is to compute the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(n)` takes a non-negative integer `n` as input. The problem description specifies that the input should be a non-negative integer, and the program adheres to this requirement.

2. **Initialization**: The variable `total` is initialized to `0`, which is appropriate as we want to start summing the digits from zero.

3. **While Loop**: The loop continues as long as `n` is greater than `0`. Inside the loop:
   - The last digit of `n` is extracted using the modulo operation (`n % 10`) and added to `total`.
   - Then, `n` is updated by removing the last digit using integer division (`n //= 10`).

4. **Termination**: When `n` is reduced to `0`, the loop stops. At this point, `total` contains the sum of all the digits of the original non-negative integer.

5. **Return Value**: The function returns `total`, which will be `0` only when the original input `n` was `0`. For any other non-negative integer, it correctly accumulates the sum of its digits.

6. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If `n` is `0`, the function will return `0`, which is the correct output.
   - For any positive integer `n`, it systematically accumulates the digits into `total`.

Thus, the code accurately follows the requirements laid out in the problem description for all specified cases of input. Therefore, the program is correct.
