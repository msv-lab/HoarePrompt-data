To determine the necessary conditions for the `while` loop to execute, we need to analyze the loop condition: `n > 0`. The loop can only execute if `n` is greater than 0.

Currently, the state indicates that `n` is a non-negative integer. A non-negative integer means that it can be 0 or any positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0.

In the current state, since `n` is non-negative and could potentially be 0, we need to adjust `n` to ensure it is indeed greater than 0.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `n` is now greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is 0**
