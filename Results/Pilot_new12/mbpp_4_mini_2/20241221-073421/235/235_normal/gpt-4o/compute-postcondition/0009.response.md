`n` is assigned a new value equal to the integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. Thus, `n` is now reduced while `total` is holding the previous value of `total + (n % 10)`. Since `n` is greater than 1, this means `n` will still hold a positive value. The previous value of `total` has been updated but remains unspecified.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1; `total` is equal to the previous value of `total + (n % 10)`; `n` is now equal to `n // 10`.**
