`total` is updated by adding the value of `n % 10` to it. The value of `n` is greater than 1, so `n % 10` could either be a value from 2 to 9, depending on `n`. Therefore, `total` will now be equal to its previous value plus this calculated remainder. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `total` is equal to the previous value of `total + (n % 10)`**
