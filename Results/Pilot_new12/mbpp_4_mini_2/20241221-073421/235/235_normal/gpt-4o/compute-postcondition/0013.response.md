Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. If `n` is 0, the function returns 0. The function effectively processes all non-negative integers, breaking them down digit by digit to accumulate their sum, irrespective of their length. Thus, for any valid input `n`, the output will always be a non-negative integer corresponding to the sum of the individual digits of `n`.**
