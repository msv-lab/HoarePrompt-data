According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the variable `n` is greater than 0. Currently, at the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1. This means that the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments. 

Thus, there are no states that need to be modified.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `total` is equal to the previous value of `total + (n % 10)`**
