The code updates the `total` variable by adding the last digit of `n` (obtained using `n % 10`). Given that `n` must be greater than 0, `n % 10` will provide a positive integer value that is the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (i.e., the last digit of `n`). 

As `total` starts at 0, after the execution of `total += n % 10`, the new value of `total` will be equal to `n % 10`. The other variable `n` remains unchanged but retains the condition of being greater than 0.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is equal to `n % 10`**.
