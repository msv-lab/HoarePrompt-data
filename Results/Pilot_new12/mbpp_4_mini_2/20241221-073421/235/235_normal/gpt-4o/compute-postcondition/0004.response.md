According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` was reduced to `n // 10`. Since `n` is currently greater than 0, it is necessary for `n` to be greater than 10 in the previous state for the loop to have executed at least one time, leading to `n` still being positive. Therefore, the state needs to reflect that `n` must be greater than 0 after being modified in the last iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than 10, `total` is equal to the previous value of `n % 10`**
