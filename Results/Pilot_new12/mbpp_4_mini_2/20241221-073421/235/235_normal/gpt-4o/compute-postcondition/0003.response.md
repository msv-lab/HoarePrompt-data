The value of `n` is divided by `10` using integer division (`//`), which effectively removes the last digit of `n`. Since `n` must be greater than `0`, `n` will remain greater than or equal to `0` after this operation. The value of `total` remains unchanged as it is computed from the original value of `n`.

The output state will reflect the modified value of `n`, while `total` retains its previous definition based on the initial value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0 and is now equal to `n // 10`; `total` is equal to the previous value of `n % 10`.**
