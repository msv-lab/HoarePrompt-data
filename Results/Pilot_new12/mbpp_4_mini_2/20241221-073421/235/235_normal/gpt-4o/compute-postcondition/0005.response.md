The value of `total` is incremented by `n % 10`. The initial state states that `n` must be greater than 10, thus `n % 10` will yield a value from 0 to 9, where `total` will be updated accordingly. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

If we denote `n` as a value greater than 10, then the new state of `total` will be `total + (n % 10)`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 10, `total` is equal to the previous value of `total + (n % 10)`**.
