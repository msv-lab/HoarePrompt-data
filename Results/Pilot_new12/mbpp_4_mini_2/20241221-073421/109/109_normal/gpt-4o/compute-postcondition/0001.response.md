The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. `list1` is a list and it is guaranteed to be not empty, while `list2` is also a list. After executing the function body, the function returns the elements of `list1` excluding the last element concatenated with `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two lists, `list1` (which is not empty) and `list2`, and return a new list consisting of the elements from `list1` except for the last element, followed by the elements of `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 (a non-empty list) and list2 (a list), and returns a concatenation of list1 excluding its last element with list2.**
