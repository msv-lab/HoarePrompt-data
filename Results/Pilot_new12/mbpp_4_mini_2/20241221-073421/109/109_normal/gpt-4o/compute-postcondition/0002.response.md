Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `list1` (a non-empty list) and `list2` (a list), and returns a new list that consists of all elements from `list1` except the last one, concatenated with all elements from `list2`. It is important to note that if `list1` contains only one element, the result will be simply `list2`. Additionally, if `list2` is empty, the function will return `list1` without its last element. The function does not handle cases where `list1` might be empty at the time of function execution, which could lead to unexpected behaviors if the precondition is not guaranteed.**
