Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases. Specifically, it does not correctly handle the situation when `list1` contains only one element. According to the problem description, the function should replace the last element of `list1` with all elements from `list2`. However, the implementation only returns `list1[:-1] + list2`, which results in `list2` being concatenated to an empty list when `list1` contains one element. 

For instance, given the input `func_1([1], [2, 3])`, the expected output should be `[2, 3]`, but the program will incorrectly return `[] + [2, 3]`, which results in `[2, 3]`, and this is indeed what we expect. 

However, if `list1` is empty, the logic would fail as trying to access `list1[:-1]` will still result as an empty list. While the assumptions specify that inputs will always be valid, the output hints mention scenarios that are not well handled, particularly for edge cases. 

Thus, since there are cases where the implementation does not align with the problem description requirements, the overall correctness is labeled as false.
