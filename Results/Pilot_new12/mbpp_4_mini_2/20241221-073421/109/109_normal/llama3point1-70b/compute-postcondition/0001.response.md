The code assigns the value of `list2` to the last element(s) of `list1`. Since `list1` is not empty and its last element will be replaced with the entire `list2`, the final state of `list1` will become a combination of its original elements (except the last one) followed by all elements of `list2`. The states of `list2` and the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`list1` will contain its original elements up to the second-to-last element, followed by all elements of `list2`; `list2` remains unchanged.**
