The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists, and `list1` must contain at least one element. The function returns `list1`, which is modified to contain its original elements up to the second-to-last element, followed by all elements of `list2`. If `list1` is empty, the function will return `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `list1` and `list2`, and return a combined list based on the contents of `list1` and `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns list1 with its last element replaced by all elements of list2, or returns list2 if list1 is empty.**
