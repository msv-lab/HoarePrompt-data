Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where `list1` is initially empty. According to the problem description, if the first list is empty, it should replace the non-existent last element with the elements of the second list. However, the code attempts to assign `list2` to `list1` instead of modifying `list1`.

For example, if we have:
```python
list1 = []
list2 = [1, 2, 3]
result = func_1(list1, list2)
```
The expected behavior would be for `list1` to become `[1, 2, 3]`. However, since the assignment `list1 = list2` does not modify `list1` in place (as `list1` is reassigned locally, leaving the original `list1` unchanged), the code will return an empty list `[]` instead.

Therefore, since the function fails to meet the requirement of the problem description for this case, the overall correctness is marked as **False**.
