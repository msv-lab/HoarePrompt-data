Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case where `list1` is empty. In the provided code, if `list1` is an empty list, the line `list1 = list2` does not modify the original `list1` since it only reassigns the local variable `list1`. The original list remains unchanged and the function ultimately returns the original empty list instead of what was expected. 

For example, if we call `func_1([], [1, 2, 3])`, the function will return `[]` instead of `[1, 2, 3]`. This demonstrates that the current implementation does not behave as described for all potential input cases, thus making it incorrect.
