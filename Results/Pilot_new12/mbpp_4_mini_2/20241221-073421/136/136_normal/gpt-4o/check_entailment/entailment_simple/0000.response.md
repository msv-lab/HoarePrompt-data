Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. The function takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and it returns a new dictionary that contains only the entries from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

### Explanation of Correctness:

1. **Input Structure**: The function accepts two parameters - a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`. It is assumed that the input will always be valid as per the problem description.

2. **Dictionary Comprehension**: The use of dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` effectively filters the dictionary. It iterates through each key-value pair in `d` and includes it in the new dictionary only if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

3. **Functionality Verification**: The program includes assertions that test the function against various scenarios:
   - For `n = 170`, the expected output is `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which matches the filtered dictionary correctly.
   - For `n = 180`, the output `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}` is also accurate.
   - For `n = 190`, the output `{'Pierre Cox': 190}` again reflects the correct filtering.

Since the function behaves as specified in the problem description for the cases tested, and handles all cases that would be encountered given valid inputs, we conclude that it is correctly implemented.

Thus, the conclusion is: Correctness: **True**.
