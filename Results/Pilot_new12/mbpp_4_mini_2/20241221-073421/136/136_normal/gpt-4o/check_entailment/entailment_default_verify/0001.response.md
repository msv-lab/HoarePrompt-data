Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program implements the functionality as described in the problem statement effectively. It uses a dictionary comprehension to filter entries based on whether their values are greater than or equal to the provided integer `n`. 

The output hints confirm that the function correctly returns a new dictionary containing only those key-value pairs from the original dictionary where the values meet the specified condition. Additionally, the function does not alter the original dictionary, which aligns with the problem description. 

All the assertions provided also pass, indicating that the code correctly handles the specified cases. There are no discrepancies found between the program's behavior, the problem description, and the output hints. As such, the correctness of the program can be confidently affirmed.
