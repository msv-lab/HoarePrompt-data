The code provided accomplishes the task of filtering a dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to a specified integer `n`. 

The program utilizes dictionary comprehension to iterate over the key-value pairs of the input dictionary `d`, retaining only those pairs where the value meets the condition `v >= n`. 

According to the output hints, when all the values in the dictionary are less than `n`, the function returns an empty dictionary, which is the expected behavior. Additionally, the function does not modify the input dictionary, creating a new dictionary instead, which aligns with the requirements.

Let's consider specific examples:

1. When provided with `({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 170)`, the expected output is `{'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is correct.
2. For `({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 180)`, the output should be `{'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is correct.
3. Finally, with `({'Cierra Vega': 175, 'Alden Cantrell': 180, 'Kierra Gentry': 165, 'Pierre Cox': 190}, 190)`, the expected output is `{'Pierre Cox': 190}`, which is again correct.

The program effectively handles the filtering condition correctly in every scenario covered by these examples. Any valid integer `n` is correctly evaluated against the dictionary values, and all potential cases where values are equal to, less than, or greater than `n` return the expected results.

Therefore, there do not appear to be any missing logic or edge cases based on the provided problem description and output hints. 

Correctness: **True**.
