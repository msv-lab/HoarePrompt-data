Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary based on the provided integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary that only includes entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. The assertions in the program demonstrate that the function works as expected for the given test cases, and there are no missing edge cases or scenarios where it would fail. The filtering is done using a dictionary comprehension that checks each value against `n`, which makes it efficient and easy to understand.
