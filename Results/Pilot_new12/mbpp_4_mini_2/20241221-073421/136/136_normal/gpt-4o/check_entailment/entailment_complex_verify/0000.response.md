Final: **True**

The original assessment stating that the function `func_1` is correct is supported by the problem description, which specifies that the function should filter a dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the provided integer `n`. The code and annotations confirm that the function implements this requirement accurately. 

The assertions provided verify that the function behaves as expected for various inputs, producing the correct output following the filtering criteria. The annotations outline that the function creates a new dictionary based on the specified condition without modifying the input, aligning with the goal stated in the problem description. 

Overall, the function meets the expectations laid out in the problem description, and the annotations effectively demonstrate its correctness in implementation. Thus, the original assessment is accurate.
