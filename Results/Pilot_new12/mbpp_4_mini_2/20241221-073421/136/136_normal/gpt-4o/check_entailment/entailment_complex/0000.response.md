Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the specified functionality as described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Specification**: The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`. It does not modify the input dictionary, adhering to the requirement of returning a new filtered dictionary.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The function utilizes a dictionary comprehension to create and return a new dictionary that includes only those key-value pairs for which the values are greater than or equal to `n`. This aligns perfectly with the problem statement, which requires filtering entries based on the threshold value `n`.

3. **Correct Output**: The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected in various scenarios. 
   - In the first assertion, the output correctly includes only the entries where the values are greater than or equal to 170.
   - In the second assertion, it appropriately filters to include values greater than or equal to 180.
   - The third assertion filters for values greater than or equal to 190, correctly returning only the relevant entry.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program will return an empty dictionary if all values are less than `n`, consistent with the expected behavior described in the annotations.

Since the program fulfills all the conditions laid out in the problem description and adheres to the behavior expected for various input scenarios, it is deemed correct.
