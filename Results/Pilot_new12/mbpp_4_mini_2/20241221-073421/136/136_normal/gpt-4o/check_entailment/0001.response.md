Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary and an integer `n`, then filters the dictionary to include only those entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`.

Here's how the program works:
1. It uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that includes only the items from the original dictionary where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.
2. The assertions provided test the function with various inputs, and they all produce the expected output. Specifically:
   - For `n = 170`, entries with values 175, 180, and 190 are included, which are correct.
   - For `n = 180`, entries with values 180 and 190 are included, which are also correct.
   - For `n = 190`, only the entry with value 190 is included, which is correct as well.

Given this analysis, the code handles the filtering logic appropriately for the cases provided and follows the problem description accurately. There are no edge cases or examples found where the function deviates from the expected behavior.
