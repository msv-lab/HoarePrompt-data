Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement by filtering entries of the provided dictionary based on the integer `n`. The assertions test various scenarios, and the outputs of the function align perfectly with expected results, confirming that the implementation behaves as intended. Additionally, the annotated version of the code further clarifies the function's behavior, affirming that it effectively generates a new dictionary with the correct key-value pairs while not modifying the input. The handling of returning an empty dictionary when all values are less than `n` is also consistent with the problem requirements. Thus, based on the provided annotations, problem description, and the correctness of output, the overall assessment remains valid.
