Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The program successfully implements the functionality specified in the problem description: filtering a dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. 

The annotations support this assessment by explicitly detailing the expected results of the function calls with various inputs. Each assertion is validated against the expected output, confirming that the program behaves correctly for all tested cases. Additionally, the annotations clarify that before the function call, both `d` and `n` are of the correct types, thus adhering to the problem requirements.

Overall, the combination of the program's logic, the assertions, and the annotations demonstrate that the function works as intended, making the final assessment justifiably **True**.
