Final: **True**

The program meets the problem description as it correctly implements a function that filters a dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the specified integer `n`. The assertions in the program demonstrate that the function works as expected for the specified test cases, returning the expected results. 

The output hints further support the correctness by accurately summarizing the function's behavior: it accepts a dictionary with integer values and returns a new dictionary based on the filtering condition without modifying the original input. The assertion outputs also align with the stated functionality, confirming that the function can handle cases where all values are below `n` by returning an empty dictionary.

Given this alignment between the program's behavior, the output hints, and the problem description, the original assessment of correctness is maintained.
