Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary of key-value pairs, where the values are integers, and an integer 'n'. The function accurately filters the dictionary to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to 'n'. 

The examples given in both the assertions and the output hints have been correctly evaluated according to the logic of the function. Furthermore, the function handles the edge case where all values in the dictionary are less than 'n' by returning an empty dictionary, as expected.

All potential cases align with the problem description, indicating that the function behaves correctly in all scenarios presented. Thus, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
