The function accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only those key-value pairs from `d` where the corresponding value is greater than or equal to `n`. If all values in `d` are less than `n`, the function will return an empty dictionary. The function does not modify the input dictionary `d` but creates a new dictionary based on the filtering condition.
