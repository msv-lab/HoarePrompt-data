#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary with values that are integers, and n is an integer.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing items from 'd' where the values are greater than or equal to 'n'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. If all values in the dictionary are less than `n`, it will return an empty dictionary. This function does not modify the input dictionary `d` and strictly filters based on the specified condition.
