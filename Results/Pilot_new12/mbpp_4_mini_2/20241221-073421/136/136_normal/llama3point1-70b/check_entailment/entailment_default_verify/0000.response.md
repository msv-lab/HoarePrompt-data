Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement: it filters a dictionary to only include key-value pairs where the values are greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The original assessment noting the program's correctness is supported by the output hints, which clarify that the function returns a new dictionary with the appropriate entries and does not modify the original input dictionary. The handling of edge cases, including scenarios where all values are less than `n`, resulting in an empty dictionary, is also correctly described. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and the assessment remains valid.
