Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to filter a dictionary based on the condition that only entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n` should be included in the output. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to generate a new dictionary that meets this criterion.

It will handle various cases, including:
- When the input dictionary is empty, it will return an empty dictionary as there are no entries to filter.
- It correctly filters out entries based on the comparison of values to `n`.
- If all values are less than `n`, the result will also be an empty dictionary.
- If some values are equal to or greater than `n`, those entries will be included in the returned dictionary.

The logic used in the function utilizes the condition `v >= n` which is directly aligned with the problem description. There do not appear to be any potential edge cases that the function does not handle properly. 

Therefore, based on the analysis of the program relative to the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
