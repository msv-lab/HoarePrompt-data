You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a dictionary and integer n and filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to n.
Program:
```
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to filter a dictionary based on the condition that only entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n` should be included in the output. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to generate a new dictionary that meets this criterion.

It will handle various cases, including:
- When the input dictionary is empty, it will return an empty dictionary as there are no entries to filter.
- It correctly filters out entries based on the comparison of values to `n`.
- If all values are less than `n`, the result will also be an empty dictionary.
- If some values are equal to or greater than `n`, those entries will be included in the returned dictionary.

The logic used in the function utilizes the condition `v >= n` which is directly aligned with the problem description. There do not appear to be any potential edge cases that the function does not handle properly. 

Therefore, based on the analysis of the program relative to the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a dictionary `d` where the values are integers and an integer `n`. It returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. If all values in the dictionary are less than `n`, it will return an empty dictionary. This function does not modify the input dictionary `d` and strictly filters based on the specified condition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
