Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided function correctly filters a dictionary based on the values in relation to the integer `n`. The output hints match the functionality of the code: they specify that the function returns a new dictionary containing key-value pairs where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses dictionary comprehension to build the new dictionary without modifying the original. 

All potential cases such as an empty dictionary or all values being less than `n` are correctly handled, returning an empty dictionary as indicated. The function operates as described for any valid input, confirming its correctness.
