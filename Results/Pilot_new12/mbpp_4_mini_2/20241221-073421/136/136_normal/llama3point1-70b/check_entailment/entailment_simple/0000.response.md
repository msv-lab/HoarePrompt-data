Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement. Here's why it always meets the specifications:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`. This matches the requirements of the problem description.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}` iterates through each key-value pair in the dictionary `d` and includes it in the resulting dictionary only if the value `v` is greater than or equal to the integer `n`. This directly addresses the task of filtering the entries based on the specified condition.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new dictionary that contains only the entries where the values meet the criterion (values greater than or equal to `n`). This aligns perfectly with the requirement of the problem to filter the dictionary.

4. **Assumptions**: The assumption that the input will be valid means we donâ€™t have to handle exceptions or invalid input cases. Since it is assumed that `d` will always be a dictionary with integer values and `n` will be an integer, the function is guaranteed to operate correctly for the expected input types.

In conclusion, the program meets all the specified requirements of the problem description, and thus, it is deemed correct.
