Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and filters the dictionary to return only the key-value pairs where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

1. The implementation uses a dictionary comprehension, iterating over the items in the input dictionary `d`, and checks if each value `v` meets the condition `v >= n`.
2. If the condition is met, the key-value pair (key `k` and value `v`) is included in the new dictionary that the function returns.
3. The function does not alter the original dictionary `d`, which aligns with the problem statement that also indicates that the function should not modify the input.

Furthermore, the function inherently handles cases when no key-value pairs meet the criteria, as it would return an empty dictionary if all values are less than `n`. 

Thus, the program successfully adheres to the specifications outlined in the problem description for every potential case of valid input.
