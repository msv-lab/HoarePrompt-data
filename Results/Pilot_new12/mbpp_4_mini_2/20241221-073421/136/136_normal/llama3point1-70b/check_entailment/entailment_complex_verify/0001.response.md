Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the filtering requirement as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary containing only those key-value pairs where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. The annotations further clarify that the function returns an empty dictionary if all values are less than `n`, which aligns with the expected behavior. 

Additionally, the assumptions regarding valid input reinforce the correctness of the program, as it is only concerned with valid dictionaries containing integer values. The overall logic of the program and its implementation matches the requirements outlined in the problem description without any discrepancies in behavior. Hence, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.
