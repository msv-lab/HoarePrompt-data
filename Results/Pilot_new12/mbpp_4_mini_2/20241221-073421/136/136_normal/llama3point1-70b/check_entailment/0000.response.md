Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries where values are greater than or equal to the integer `n`, as per the problem description. The use of a dictionary comprehension efficiently constructs the new dictionary, and it correctly iterates over all items in the dictionary. It handles various cases, including dictionaries with negative values, zero, and positive numbers, as well as cases where the dictionary may be empty. All potential inputs adhere to the stated logic. Thus, there are no identified edge cases where the function fails to meet the requirements.
