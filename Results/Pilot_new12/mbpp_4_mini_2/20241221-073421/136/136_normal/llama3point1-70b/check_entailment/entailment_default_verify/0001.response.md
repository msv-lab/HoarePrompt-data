Final: **True**

The original assessment concludes that the program is correct, which is substantiated by both the problem description and the output hints. The function `func_1` accurately implements the required logic to filter dictionary entries based on their values compared to the specified integer `n`. The usage of a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary ensures that this is done efficiently and does not modify the input dictionary, in line with the output hints provided.

The function has been assessed to handle all specified cases appropriately:
- It returns an empty dictionary when the input dictionary is empty.
- It correctly filters entries based on the comparison of values to `n` and handles cases when no entries meet the criteria by returning an empty dictionary.

All of these points align perfectly with the problem description and the output hints, reaffirming the correctness of the original assessment. Thus, the conclusion remains that the program is functioning correctly.
