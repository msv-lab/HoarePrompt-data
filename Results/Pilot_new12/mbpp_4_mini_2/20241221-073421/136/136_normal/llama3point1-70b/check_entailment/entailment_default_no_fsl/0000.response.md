Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. It takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and it filters the dictionary to only include entries where the values are greater than or equal to `n`. 

Following the output hints:
1. The function returns a new dictionary that meets the filtering criteria, which aligns with the problem description.
2. If all values in the dictionary are less than `n`, the function returns an empty dictionary, which is also correct as per the requirements.
3. The implementation uses a dictionary comprehension, which is an efficient and clear way to achieve the filtering without modifying the original dictionary, further confirming the function adheres to the specifications provided.

Since there are no discrepancies or unhandled cases under the assumption of valid inputs as stated, the program is deemed correct.
