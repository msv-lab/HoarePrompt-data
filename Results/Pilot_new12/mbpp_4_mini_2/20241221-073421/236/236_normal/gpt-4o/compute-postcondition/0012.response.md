The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared to each other. The function checks the elements of the list for their order. If there is any pair of elements `lst[i]` and `lst[i + 1]` such that `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, it returns `False`. If all comparisons hold true, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and check if it is sorted in non-decreasing order, returning `True` if it is sorted and `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, and returns True if lst is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns False.**
