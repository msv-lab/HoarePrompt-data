Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, and the element at index `i` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`. If `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, since there is no else part, the state remains unchanged.***
