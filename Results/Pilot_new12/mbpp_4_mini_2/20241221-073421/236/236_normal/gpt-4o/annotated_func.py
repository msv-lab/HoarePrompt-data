#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be compared to each other.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list 'lst' is sorted in non-decreasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of elements that can be compared. It checks if the elements in `lst` are sorted in non-decreasing order. If any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the entire list is iterated without finding any unsorted pair, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. The function does not handle edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element explicitly, but an empty list or a list with one element would naturally return `True` as they are considered sorted in non-decreasing order.
