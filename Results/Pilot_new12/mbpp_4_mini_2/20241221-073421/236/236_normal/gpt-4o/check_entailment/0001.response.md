To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description which requires checking if a specified list is sorted or not.

1. **Review of the Functionality**:
   - The function processes a given list `lst` and checks if it is sorted in ascending order.
   - It uses a for loop to iterate through each element of the list, comparing each element with the next one.

2. **Logic of the Code**:
   - If any element is greater than the next element (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
   - If it completes the loop without finding any such case, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - Let's consider an edge case where the provided list is empty (`[]`). According to the typical interpretation, an empty list is considered sorted.
   - Another case is a single-element list (e.g., `[1]`), which would also be considered sorted.
   - Also, a list with duplicates (e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`) must return `True`, since it is in non-decreasing order.

4. **Test Cases**:
   The asserted test cases:
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True` — Correct, as the list is sorted.
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False` — Correct, since `20 > 17`.
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False` — Correct, since `15 > 14`.

5. **Finding a Missing Logic Case**:
   Since `func_1` currently does not check for an empty list or a list with a single element, it may incorrectly return `None` if an empty list is passed, or does not handle single-element lists correctly.

6. **Final Verdict**:
   - Given that there are edge cases such as an empty list or a single element that are not handled correctly by the current implementation, the function does not fulfill the problem requirements for all cases.

Thus, the final correctness is:

Correctness: **False** 

This is due to the failure to address empty lists and single-element lists appropriately.
