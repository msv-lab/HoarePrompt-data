Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether the specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

1. It iterates through the list using a loop from the first element to the second-to-last element.
2. For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the current element is greater than the next one. If it finds such a case, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
3. If the loop completes without finding any such case, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

The provided assertions cover multiple cases:
- The first assertion tests a sorted list, which should return `True`.
- The second and third assertions check unsorted lists, correctly returning `False`.

All these tests pass, and the logic confirms that the function will correctly determine if a list is sorted for all potential cases.
