Based on the provided problem description, which requires writing a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not, the original assessment accurately reflects the program's behavior concerning this requirement.

1. The function `func_1` iteratively compares elements of the list to determine if it is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. The test cases provided clearly illustrate that the function returns the expected outputs for both sorted and unsorted lists.
3. The annotated version of the code clarifies that the function would return `True` for both an empty list and a single-element list, as they are indeed considered sorted in non-decreasing order.
4. While the original assessment pointed out a potential oversight in missing explicit handling of edge cases (empty lists and single-element lists), the behavior of the code itself does not lead to incorrect outputs. The code correctly handles these cases, albeit without specific checks for them.

Considering that the function does fulfill the requirement of determining sorted order for valid input lists, including the edge cases that were highlighted:

Final: **True**
