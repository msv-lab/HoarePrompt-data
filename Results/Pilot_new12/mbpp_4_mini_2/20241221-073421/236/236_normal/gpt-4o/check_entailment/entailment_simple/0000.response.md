Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the task of checking whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Here's why the program meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Input Type**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and iterates through the elements.
2. **Comparison Logic**: It checks each pair of consecutive elements in the list. If it finds any pair where the earlier element is greater than the later element (i.e., `lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), it concludes that the list is not sorted and returns `False`.
3. **Sorted Lists**: If the loop completes without finding any such descending pairs, the function concludes that the list is sorted and returns `True`.
4. **Test Cases**: The assertion statements provided serve as test cases, confirming that the function behaves as expected for different scenarios, including a sorted list and various unsorted lists.

Overall, since the implementation fulfills the requirement of checking for sorted order as stipulated in the problem description, it is considered correct.
