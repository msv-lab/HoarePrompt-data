Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` checks if a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order by iterating through the list and comparing each element to the next. It returns `False` if it finds any element that is greater than the subsequent one, indicating the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without finding such a pair, it returns `True`, meaning the list is sorted.

The provided assertions test the function with multiple scenarios, including a sorted list and lists that are not sorted. The function handles edge cases adequately: an empty list or a list with one element is considered sorted by definition in non-decreasing order.

Since all potential valid inputs (including an empty list and a single-element list) would function as expected and the code handles the examples provided correctly, the program meets the requirements stated in the problem description for every potential case. Thus, the code behaves as intended, confirming its correctness.
