You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly checks whether the specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

1. It iterates through the list using a loop from the first element to the second-to-last element.
2. For each pair of adjacent elements, it checks if the current element is greater than the next one. If it finds such a case, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
3. If the loop completes without finding any such case, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

The provided assertions cover multiple cases:
- The first assertion tests a sorted list, which should return `True`.
- The second and third assertions check unsorted lists, correctly returning `False`.

All these tests pass, and the logic confirms that the function will correctly determine if a list is sorted for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of elements that can be compared. It checks if the elements in `lst` are sorted in non-decreasing order. If any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the entire list is iterated without finding any unsorted pair, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. The function does not handle edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element explicitly, but an empty list or a list with one element would naturally return `True` as they are considered sorted in non-decreasing order.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
