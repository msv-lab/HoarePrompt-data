Final: **True**

The program `func_1` accurately implements the required functionality by iterating through the provided list and checking for the ordering of the elements. The assertions provided effectively test various scenarios that confirm its correctness: a sorted list returns `True`, while unsorted lists return `False`. 

The original assessment logically concludes that the function correctly identifies whether the list is in non-decreasing order. Moreover, the function inherently handles edge cases such as empty lists and single-element lists, as these are considered sorted by definition. Therefore, the output hints reinforce that the function's design aligns with the problem description, adequately validating the original assessment.
