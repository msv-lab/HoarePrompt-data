Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement from the problem description, which is to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Here's why the implementation meets the problem's requirements:

1. **Loop for Comparison**: The function utilizes a loop to iterate through the list and compares each element with its subsequent element. It does this using the condition `if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`. If it finds any such pair where the current element is greater than the next, it immediately returns `False`, indicating the list is not sorted.

2. **Returning True for Sorted List**: If the loop completes without finding any unsorted pairs, the function returns `True`, confirming that the list is indeed sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function does not specifically handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element, but it appropriately returns `True` for these cases since an empty list or a single-element list is generally considered sorted. The annotations and explanation provided also confirm that the function is designed to operate under the assumption that inputs are valid.

4. **Assertions Validation**: The assertions in the program cover various cases, including sorted lists and lists that are confirmed to be unsorted, which reinforces that the implementation adheres to the requirements stated in the problem description.

Overall, the implementation fulfills the requirement to check if a list is sorted according to the given definition, leading to the conclusion that it functions correctly for all valid input scenarios as described in the problem.
