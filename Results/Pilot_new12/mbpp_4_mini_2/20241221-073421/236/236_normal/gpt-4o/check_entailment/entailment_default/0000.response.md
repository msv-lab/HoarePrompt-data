The provided function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next element. If it finds any pair where the previous element is greater than the next one, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If no such pair is found, it returns `True`, meaning the list is sorted.

The output hints specify the behavior of the function and mention that it does not explicitly handle edge cases such as empty lists or lists with a single element. However, according to the logic of the function, both an empty list and a list with one element would return `True`, as there are no elements to violate the sorted order.

Upon reviewing the examples provided in the assertions:
- The first list is correctly identified as sorted.
- The second and third lists are correctly identified as not sorted.

Since the function logically accounts for how it handles lists of any length, the implementation of the function satisfies the problem description for all potential valid cases (valid lists).

Correctness: **True**.
