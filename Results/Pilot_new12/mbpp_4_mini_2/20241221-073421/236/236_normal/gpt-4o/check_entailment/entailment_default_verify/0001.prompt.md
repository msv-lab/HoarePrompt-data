You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description which requires checking if a specified list is sorted or not.

1. **Review of the Functionality**:
   - The function processes a given list `lst` and checks if it is sorted in ascending order.
   - It uses a for loop to iterate through each element of the list, comparing each element with the next one.

2. **Logic of the Code**:
   - If any element is greater than the next element (`lst[i] > lst[i + 1]`), the function immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
   - If it completes the loop without finding any such case, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - Let's consider an edge case where the provided list is empty (`[]`). According to the typical interpretation, an empty list is considered sorted.
   - Another case is a single-element list (e.g., `[1]`), which would also be considered sorted.
   - Also, a list with duplicates (e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`) must return `True`, since it is in non-decreasing order.

4. **Test Cases**:
   The asserted test cases:
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True` — Correct, as the list is sorted.
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False` — Correct, since `20 > 17`.
   - `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False` — Correct, since `15 > 14`.

5. **Finding a Missing Logic Case**:
   Since `func_1` currently does not check for an empty list or a list with a single element, it may incorrectly return `None` if an empty list is passed, or does not handle single-element lists correctly.

6. **Final Verdict**:
   - Given that there are edge cases such as an empty list or a single element that are not handled correctly by the current implementation, the function does not fulfill the problem requirements for all cases.

Thus, the final correctness is:

Correctness: **False** 

This is due to the failure to address empty lists and single-element lists appropriately.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of elements that can be compared. It checks if the elements in `lst` are sorted in non-decreasing order. If any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the entire list is iterated without finding any unsorted pair, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted. The function does not handle edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element explicitly, but an empty list or a list with one element would naturally return `True` as they are considered sorted in non-decreasing order.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
