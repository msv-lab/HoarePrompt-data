You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program checks whether the specified list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of the list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. This approach accurately identifies both ascending and descending orders, as well as cases with duplicate values.

For example:
- For the input list `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, the function would return `True` because the list is sorted in ascending order.
- For the input list `[3, 2, 1]`, it would return `False` as the list is sorted in descending order.
- For an empty list `[]`, it returns `True`, which is correct since an empty list is considered sorted.
- Similarly, for a single element list `[5]`, it returns `True`, which is also correct since a list with one element is inherently sorted.

Since I could not identify any potential case where the program fails to fulfill the problem's requirements, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It checks whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. The function returns True if the list is sorted, and False otherwise. It operates correctly on edge cases, such as an empty list (which is considered sorted) or a list with one element (which is also considered sorted). However, the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of integers, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the wrong data type is passed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
