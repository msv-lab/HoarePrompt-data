You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'nums' is sorted in non-decreasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It checks whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. The function returns True if the list is sorted, and False otherwise. It operates correctly on edge cases, such as an empty list (which is considered sorted) or a list with one element (which is also considered sorted). However, the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of integers, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the wrong data type is passed.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
