Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is designed to check if a specified list of integers is sorted in non-decreasing order. While it correctly handles the cases of an empty list or a single element list, the program does not validate the input to ensure that it is specifically a list of integers. As per the output hints, this leads to unexpected behavior if the wrong data type is passed, which violates the requirement of handling every potential case outlined in the problem description.

For example, if an input like `[3, '2', 1]` or a non-list input like `None` is provided, the function would still perform the comparison but yield incorrect results or even raise an exception under certain conditions. This indicates that the code does not operate correctly for all potential cases, thus confirming its correctness is **False**.
