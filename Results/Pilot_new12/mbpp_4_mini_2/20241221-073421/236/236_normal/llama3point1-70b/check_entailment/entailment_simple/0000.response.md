Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description, which is to check whether a specified list (in this case, a list of integers) is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Here's how it meets the criteria:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(nums)` evaluates if the list `nums` is equal to the sorted version of itself using the expression `nums == sorted(nums)`. This checks if the elements are in non-decreasing order, as sorting the list will rearrange its elements appropriately.

2. **Boolean Return Value**: The program returns a boolean value (`True` if the list is sorted, `False` otherwise), which aligns with the typical expectation for a function that checks for a property (in this case, whether the list is sorted).

3. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The problem states that valid input will always be provided. Therefore, the function does not need to handle cases such as empty lists or non-list inputs. According to the problem description, the behavior of the function under the assumption of valid inputs is sufficient for correctness.

Given these points, the function `func_1` effectively fulfills the requirements set out in the problem description regarding checking if a list is sorted.
