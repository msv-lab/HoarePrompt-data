Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies the function `func_1` as meeting the problem description of checking whether a specified list is sorted. The annotated version supports this assessment by clearly stating that the function compares the input list `nums` to its sorted version, correctly returning a boolean value indicating if the list is in non-decreasing order.

Additionally, the annotations acknowledge that the function operates correctly on edge cases, such as empty lists and lists with a single element, which are considered sorted. The assessment also notes that while the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of integers, it is stated that valid input will be provided. This assumption validates the correctness of the function based on the parameters set in the problem description.

Thus, the original assessment's conclusion of correctness stands justified, confirming that the function behaves as expected under the defined conditions.
