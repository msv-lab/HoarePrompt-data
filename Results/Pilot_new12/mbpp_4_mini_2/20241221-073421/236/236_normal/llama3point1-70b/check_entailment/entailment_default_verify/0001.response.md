Based on the problem description, the program is intended to check whether a specified list is sorted. The implementation correctly checks if the list `nums` is equal to its sorted version, which adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description. The function indeed handles edge cases appropriately, such as empty lists and lists with one element.

However, the output hints indicate a critical constraint: the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of integers. This is a valid concern, as it means that the program could produce unexpected behavior or not function correctly under those conditions, despite the assumption that valid input will always be supplied. 

This discrepancy suggests that the function's implementation could lead to incorrect results if provided with an invalid input type, contradicting the robustness expected in correct implementations.

Given this new perspective from the output hints, while the function is valid when used with the expected input type, its inability to handle unexpected input types indicates that it does not meet the overall criteria for robustness and correctness in a general sense.

Therefore, I would revise the original assessment based on this crucial observation.

Final: **False**
