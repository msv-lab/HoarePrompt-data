Final: **True**

The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether the list `nums` is sorted, and the reasoning provided aligns well with the problem description. The annotated version of the code confirms that the input, assumed to be valid as stated, is handled appropriately. The function returns a boolean indicating whether `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to the sorted version of `nums`, which effectively satisfies the task's requirements. Given the annotations and the overall functionality of the program, the assessment of correctness as **True** remains valid.
