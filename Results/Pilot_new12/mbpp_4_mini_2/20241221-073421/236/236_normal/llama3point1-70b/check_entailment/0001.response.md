Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted by comparing it to the result of `sorted(nums)`. This approach correctly handles various cases:

1. If the list is empty or contains a single element, it is correctly identified as sorted.
2. For a non-empty list, the program will check if the original list is equal to its sorted version. If they are equal, it means the list is sorted; otherwise, it is not.

All edge cases, including lists with duplicate items (which are considered sorted), are naturally handled by this implementation, ensuring it meets the problem description requirements. Hence, the function works correctly for all potential cases, confirming its correctness.
