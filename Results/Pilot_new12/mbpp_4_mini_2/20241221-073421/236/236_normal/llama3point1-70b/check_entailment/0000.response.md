Correctness: **True**.

The provided program checks whether the specified list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of the list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. This approach accurately identifies both ascending and descending orders, as well as cases with duplicate values.

For example:
- For the input list `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, the function would return `True` because the list is sorted in ascending order.
- For the input list `[3, 2, 1]`, it would return `False` as the list is sorted in descending order.
- For an empty list `[]`, it returns `True`, which is correct since an empty list is considered sorted.
- Similarly, for a single element list `[5]`, it returns `True`, which is also correct since a list with one element is inherently sorted.

Since I could not identify any potential case where the program fails to fulfill the problem's requirements, the program is correct.
