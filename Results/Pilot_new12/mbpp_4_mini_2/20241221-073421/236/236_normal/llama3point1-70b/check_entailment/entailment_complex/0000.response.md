Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to check whether a specified list is sorted. 

Here's why it satisfies the problem description:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes a list of integers (`nums`) as input and checks whether this list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It does this by comparing the list to its sorted version using the expression `nums == sorted(nums)`. If the two are equal, it implies that the list is sorted, so the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**: The implementation correctly handles edge cases:
   - An empty list (`[]`) is considered sorted since there are no elements to violate the sorted order.
   - A list with a single element (e.g., `[5]`) is also correctly considered sorted because there is no other element to compare against.

3. **Assumptions on Input**: The annotation correctly identifies that the function assumes valid input (a list of integers). Under the conditions stated in the prompt, we assume that the function will only receive valid inputs and that it will not encounter any type errors.

Since the function consistently achieves the intended behavior as outlined in the problem description, it can be deemed correct.
