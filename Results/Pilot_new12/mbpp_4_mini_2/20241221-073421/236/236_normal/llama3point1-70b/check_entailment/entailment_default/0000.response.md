Explanation: The code looks correct at first glance. The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list `nums` is equal to its sorted version using `sorted(nums)`. This means the function will correctly return `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order and `False` otherwise. According to the output hints, the function also appears to handle edge cases such as an empty list and a one-element list appropriately, both of which should return `True` since they are considered sorted.

However, the output hints point out that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of integers. If a user inputs a different data type (for example, a string or a None type), the function may behave unexpectedly. Although we assume valid inputs as per the problem statement, this represents a potential edge case that the program does not account for, leading to incorrect behavior in those situations.

Correctness: **False**.
