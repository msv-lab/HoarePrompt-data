You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program checks whether the specified list is sorted by comparing it to a sorted version of the list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. This approach accurately identifies both ascending and descending orders, as well as cases with duplicate values.

For example:
- For the input list `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, the function would return `True` because the list is sorted in ascending order.
- For the input list `[3, 2, 1]`, it would return `False` as the list is sorted in descending order.
- For an empty list `[]`, it returns `True`, which is correct since an empty list is considered sorted.
- Similarly, for a single element list `[5]`, it returns `True`, which is also correct since a list with one element is inherently sorted.

Since I could not identify any potential case where the program fails to fulfill the problem's requirements, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'nums' is sorted in non-decreasing order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It checks whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. The function returns True if the list is sorted, and False otherwise. It operates correctly on edge cases, such as an empty list (which is considered sorted) or a list with one element (which is also considered sorted). However, the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of integers, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the wrong data type is passed.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
