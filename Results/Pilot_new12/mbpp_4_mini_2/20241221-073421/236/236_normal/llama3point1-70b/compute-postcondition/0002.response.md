Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It checks whether the list is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing it to its sorted version. The function returns True if the list is sorted, and False otherwise. It operates correctly on edge cases, such as an empty list (which is considered sorted) or a list with one element (which is also considered sorted). However, the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of integers, potentially leading to unexpected behavior if the wrong data type is passed.**
