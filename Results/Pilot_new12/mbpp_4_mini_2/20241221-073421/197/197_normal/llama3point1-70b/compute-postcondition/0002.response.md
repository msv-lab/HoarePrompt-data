Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns an integer representing the total count of occurrences of elements in `lst` within the tuple `tup`. It iterates through each element in `lst`, counts its occurrences in `tup`, and sums all these counts. The function handles elements of any type within the tuple and list. It is important to note that if either `tup` or `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, as there will be no elements to count. Overall, the final state of the program will have this total count returned as output. **
