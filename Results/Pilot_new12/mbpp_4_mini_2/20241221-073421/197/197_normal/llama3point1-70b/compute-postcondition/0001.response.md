The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple containing elements of any type, and `lst`, which is a list containing elements of any type. After executing the function body, it returns the total count of occurrences of each element in the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and return the total count of how many times each element in `lst` appears in `tup`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the total count of occurrences of each element in `lst` within the tuple `tup`.**
