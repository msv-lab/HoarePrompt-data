Correctness: **False**

The problem description asks for a function that counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. However, the provided program does not meet this requirement correctly. 

The program calculates the total count of occurrences of all elements in the list within the tuple, returning a single integer that represents this total. This is not the same as counting the occurrences of each individual element in the list as specified in the problem description.

To meet the requirement, the function should return a dictionary or a similar structure that associates each element of the list with its count of occurrences in the tuple. Instead, the current implementation simply sums up these counts, which does not provide the individual counts for each element in the list.

For example, given the inputs:
- `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3, 4)`
- `lst = [2, 3]`

The correct output according to the problem description would be a count for each element, which might be represented as `{2: 2, 3: 1}`. However, the provided program would return `3`, which is the total count of occurrences of `2` (2 times) and `3` (1 time), rather than the individual counts.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements as outlined in the problem description.
