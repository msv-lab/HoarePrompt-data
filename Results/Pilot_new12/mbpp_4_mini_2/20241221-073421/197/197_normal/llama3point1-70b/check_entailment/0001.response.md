Correctness: **True**

The program correctly counts the occurrences of all elements of the list (`lst`) within the tuple (`tup`). It does this by using a generator expression that iterates through each element in the list and sums up the count of each element found in the tuple. 

For example:
- If `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3)` and `lst = [2, 3, 4]`, the function would return `3` since `2` occurs `2` times and `3` occurs `1` time, while `4` occurs `0` times.
- If `tup = (1, 1, 1)` and `lst = [1]`, the function would return `3` since `1` appears `3` times in the tuple.

The function handles both the case of elements not present in the tuple and the case of multiple occurrences efficiently. There are no edge cases missed that would lead to incorrect results as long as the input data types are respected (i.e., a list and a tuple). Thus, the implementation meets the problem requirements accurately.
