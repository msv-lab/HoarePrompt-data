Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to count the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses a generator expression to iterate through each element in the list `lst`, counting its occurrences in the tuple `tup` using the `count()` method. The sum of these counts is then returned. 

According to the output hints, if either `tup` or `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem. The function handles elements of any type within the tuple and list, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. Overall, the program is correct for all potential cases that fall within the specified input constraints.
