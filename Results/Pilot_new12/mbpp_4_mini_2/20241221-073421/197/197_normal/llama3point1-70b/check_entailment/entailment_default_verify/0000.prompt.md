You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case when the list (`lst`) contains elements that are not present in the tuple (`tup`). Although the function calculates the occurrence of each element in the list by counting how many times each element appears in the tuple, it does not correctly account for elements in the list that might not exist in the tuple. 

For example:

1. If `tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)` and `lst = [5]`, the expected output should be 0 because there are no occurrences of 5 in the tuple. However, the function would return 0, which is correct, but it doesn't handle cases with actual counts correctly when there are non-existing elements involved alongside existing ones. 

2. If `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3)` and `lst = [2, 5]`, the function would correctly return 2 for 2, but it won't account for providing a clear total presence of all counts alongside missing elements.

In conclusion, while the basic logic appears to work, the description of counting occurrences was not fully respected in the context of output expectations for elements not present in the tuple alongside existing ones. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns an integer representing the total count of occurrences of elements in `lst` within the tuple `tup`. It iterates through each element in `lst`, counts its occurrences in `tup`, and sums all these counts. The function handles elements of any type within the tuple and list. It is important to note that if either `tup` or `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, as there will be no elements to count. Overall, the final state of the program will have this total count returned as output.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
