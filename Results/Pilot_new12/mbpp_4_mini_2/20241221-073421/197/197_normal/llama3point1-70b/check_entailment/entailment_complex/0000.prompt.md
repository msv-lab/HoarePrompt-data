You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing elements of any type, and lst is a list containing elements of any type.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the total count of occurrences of each element in the list 'lst' within the tuple 'tup'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns an integer representing the total count of occurrences of elements in `lst` within the tuple `tup`. It iterates through each element in `lst`, counts its occurrences in `tup`, and sums all these counts. The function handles elements of any type within the tuple and list. It is important to note that if either `tup` or `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, as there will be no elements to count. Overall, the final state of the program will have this total count returned as output.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
