The provided program is defined to count the occurrences of all elements in a list within a tuple. Let's break down the key points regarding its correctness against the problem description.

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list). This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Counting Mechanism**: The program uses a generator expression to iterate through each `element` in `lst`, counts how many times that `element` appears in `tup` using the `count` method, and sums these counts. This accurately fulfills the requirement to count occurrences of each element of the list in the tuple.

3. **Handling Empty Inputs**: The annotation mentions that if either `tup` or `lst` is empty, the function will return 0. This is a correct interpretation of the requirement that there are no elements to count in such cases. 

4. **Return Type**: The function ultimately returns an integer, which aligns with the expected output type inferred from the problem description.

In conclusion, the functionality described by the program aligns perfectly with the requirements specified in the problem description. The function correctly counts the occurrences of all elements in the list within the tuple and handles the case of empty inputs gracefully. 

Given this analysis, the correctness of the program can be confidently stated:

Correctness: **True**
