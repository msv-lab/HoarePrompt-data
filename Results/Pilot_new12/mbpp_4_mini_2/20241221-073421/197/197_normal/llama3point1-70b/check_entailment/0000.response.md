Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case when the list (`lst`) contains elements that are not present in the tuple (`tup`). Although the function calculates the occurrence of each element in the list by counting how many times each element appears in the tuple, it does not correctly account for elements in the list that might not exist in the tuple. 

For example:

1. If `tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)` and `lst = [5]`, the expected output should be 0 because there are no occurrences of 5 in the tuple. However, the function would return 0, which is correct, but it doesn't handle cases with actual counts correctly when there are non-existing elements involved alongside existing ones. 

2. If `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3)` and `lst = [2, 5]`, the function would correctly return 2 for 2, but it won't account for providing a clear total presence of all counts alongside missing elements.

In conclusion, while the basic logic appears to work, the description of counting occurrences was not fully respected in the context of output expectations for elements not present in the tuple alongside existing ones. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect.
