Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because, while the function counts occurrences correctly for existing elements, it does not provide a clear interpretation or handling for the presence of non-existing elements in the list. The problem description specifically asks for the function to count occurrences, implying the need for clarity in how non-existing elements are treated in relation to the outputs. 

The current implementation returns the total count of occurrences, which can be misleading if the expectation is to provide counts for all elements in `lst`, regardless of whether they appear in `tup`. As illustrated in the examples from the original assessment, the count of non-existing elements does not contribute to the output, leading to ambiguity in the interpretation of results. 

Thus, the program does not fully satisfy the problem description, confirming the original assessment of correctness as **False**.
