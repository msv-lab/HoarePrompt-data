Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of all elements in a list within a tuple. According to the problem description, if either the tuple or the list is empty, the function returns 0, which matches the expected behavior. The function iterates through each element in the list, counts its occurrences in the tuple, and sums these counts to return the final total. It is designed to handle elements of any type, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description accurately.

Since we assume valid inputs will always be provided to the function, the function will perform correctly for any valid case without any missing logic or edge cases. Therefore, the implementation is correct based on the provided criteria.
