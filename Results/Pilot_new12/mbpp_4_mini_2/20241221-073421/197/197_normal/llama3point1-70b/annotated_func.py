#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing elements of any type, and lst is a list containing elements of any type.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the total count of occurrences of each element in the list 'lst' within the tuple 'tup'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns an integer representing the total count of occurrences of elements in `lst` within the tuple `tup`. It iterates through each element in `lst`, counts its occurrences in `tup`, and sums all these counts. The function handles elements of any type within the tuple and list. It is important to note that if either `tup` or `lst` is empty, the function will return 0, as there will be no elements to count. Overall, the final state of the program will have this total count returned as output.
