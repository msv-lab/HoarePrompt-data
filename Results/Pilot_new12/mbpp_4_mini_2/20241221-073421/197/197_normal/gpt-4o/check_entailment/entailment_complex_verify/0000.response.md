Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the program's correctness based on the problem description and the provided code, as well as the annotated version. The function `func_1` has been shown to correctly count the occurrences of elements from the list in the tuple, as demonstrated by the included assertions. 

The annotations further support this conclusion, confirming that the function effectively handles different cases, including empty inputs and when no elements from the list are present in the tuple. The handling of duplicates in the list of elements is also addressed, with no negative impact on the correctness of the function in fulfilling the problem's requirements.

Overall, the program meets the conditions outlined in the problem description, and the annotations support the correctness of its operations. Thus, the conclusion remains that the program is correct.
