To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a Python function that counts the occurrences of all elements in a list that are present in a tuple.

### Analyzing the Program
Here is the program provided:

```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

The function `func_1` does the following:
1. It takes in a tuple `tup` and a list of `elements`.
2. It counts the total occurrences of each element from the list in the tuple using a generator expression.
3. It sums these counts and returns the total.

### Test Cases
The assertions provided:

```python
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3  # 'a' appears 2 times, 'b' once, total = 3
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6  # '1' appears 3 times, '4' appears 2 times, '7' once, total = 6
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2  # '1' appears once, '2' appears once, total = 2
```

### Edge Cases
Let's consider additional cases:
- **Empty tuple:** `func_1((), ['a'])` should return `0` since there are no elements in the tuple. This edge case is correctly handled.
- **Element not present:** `func_1(('x', 'y', 'z'), ['a', 'b'])` should return `0` as none of the elements are in the tuple. The code handles this case correctly.
- **Duplicates in the elements list:** `func_1(('a', 'b', 'a', 'c'), ['a', 'a'])` should return `2` but it will return `2` as well because it correctly sums the counts but might not be logically relevant since the problem doesn't specify handling duplicates in `elements`.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the implementation and considering edge cases, I could not find any cases where the given function does not correctly fulfill the problem description. The function accurately sums the occurrences of the specified elements in the tuple for all input scenarios discussed.

Correctness: **True**.
