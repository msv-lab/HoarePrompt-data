Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the task as defined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`, and counts the total occurrences of all the elements in the list that are present in the tuple.

Here's how the function works and meets the problem description:

1. **Input Types**: The function expects a tuple and a list, as specified. The annotations confirming the state of `tup` and `elements` help validate that the function is used as intended.

2. **Element Counting**: The core logic of the function uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to iterate over each element in the list `elements`, counts how many times it appears in the tuple `tup` using `tup.count(element)`, and sums these counts to get a total.

3. **Handling of Empty Cases**: 
   - If `elements` is empty, the generator expression produces no elements, and `sum()` will return 0 as expected, which is correct behavior since there are no elements to count.
   - If the tuple `tup` contains no elements from `elements`, each `tup.count(element)` will return 0 for those elements, ensuring the total count reflects this.

4. **Multiple Occurrences**: The function correctly handles cases where an element in `elements` appears multiple times in the `tup`, accurately counting and summing those occurrences.

The provided assertions in the program serve as test cases to confirm that the function behaves as expected and produces the correct output in various scenarios. Hence, the function adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description consistently.

Overall, the implementation is valid and correctly fulfills the problem's specifications in all potential cases.
