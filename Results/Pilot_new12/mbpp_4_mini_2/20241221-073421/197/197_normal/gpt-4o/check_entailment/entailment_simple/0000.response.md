Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `elements`, which is a list of elements whose occurrences in the tuple need to be counted. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Input Types**: The function is designed to handle a tuple and a list, consistent with the problem description.
   
2. **Counting Logic**: Within the function, the `sum` function is used along with a generator expression, which iterates over each element in the `elements` list and counts how many times it appears in the `tup` using the `count` method of tuples. This effectively calculates the total occurrences of all specified elements in the provided tuple.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count of occurrences as an integer, which aligns with the expected output as described.

The provided assertions check various inputs and confirm that `func_1` returns the correct sums of occurrences for those test cases. Since the implementation meets the specifications outlined in the problem description for these inputs, we can confidently state the correctness of the program. Thus, it consistently performs the intended operation for all valid inputs as specified.
