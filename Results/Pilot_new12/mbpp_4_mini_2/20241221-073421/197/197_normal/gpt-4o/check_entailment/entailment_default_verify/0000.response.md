Based on the provided problem description and the program's implementation, it is evident that the function `func_1` accurately counts the occurrences of elements from the list within the tuple and returns the correct total count. The function meets the problem description's requirements and handles edge cases effectively, such as when the `elements` list is empty or when elements do not appear in the tuple.

The output hints support these observations, confirming that the function provides the correct functionality for counting occurrences and that it behaves appropriately given valid inputs.

Both the original assessment and the output hints align with the functionality of the code, and there are no discrepancies. Therefore, the original assessment that the program correctly fulfills the problem description stands validated.

Final: **True**
