Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. The function effectively counts the occurrences of each element in the provided list that are found in the tuple, fulfilling the intended task. 

The annotations further reinforce this assessment by explicitly stating the expected outcomes for the test cases and explaining the function's logic. Additionally, the edge cases discussed, such as the behavior with empty lists and tuples, align with the expected functioning of the program.

Thus, taking into account the original assessment, the reasoning behind it, and the annotations that provide further confirmation of the correct behavior, there is sufficient evidence to conclude that the program is indeed correct as per the problem description.
