Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that counts the occurrences of specified elements from a list within a given tuple. The assertions provided in the test indicate that the function is working correctly for the tested cases, and the output hints clarify the expected behavior for edge cases. 

- If the list of elements is empty, the function correctly returns 0, which is also consistent with the hint.
- Additionally, if none of the elements from the list appear in the tuple, the function returns 0, which is again in line with the expectations outlined in the hints.

Since no cases have been identified where the function fails to meet the problem description and the function performs correctly for the given examples as well as implied edge cases, the program can be deemed correct.

Thus, the overall conclusion is that the code functions properly for every potential case as described.
