To determine the correctness of the program according to the provided problem description, let's analyze the function `func_1`:

```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
```

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to count the occurrences of all elements from a list within a tuple.

### Analysis of the Function:
The function uses a generator expression inside the `sum()` function to iterate over each element in the list `elements`. It counts how many times each element appears in the tuple `tup` using the `count()` method of the tuple.

### Test Cases Provided:
1. `assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3`
   - Here, 'a' appears 2 times and 'b' appears 1 time, totaling 3.
   
2. `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6`
   - Here, '1' appears 3 times, '4' appears 2 times, and '7' appears 1 time, totaling 6.
   
3. `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2`
   - Here, '1' appears 1 time and '2' appears 1 time, totaling 2.

### Missing Edge Cases:
We must check if the function handles edge cases correctly:
- If `elements` is an empty list, the count should logically be 0, and the function works as intended since `sum()` of an empty iterable is 0.
- If `tup` is an empty tuple, the function should return 0 regardless of the elements in the list since there are no elements to count in the tuple.
- If `elements` contains items not present in the tuple, such as a string when the tuple contains integers or vice versa, it should still return a count that reflects only the present elements.

We can verify an edge case:
- Test with an empty tuple and non-empty list.

### Edge Case Test Example:
```python
# Edge case: empty tuple and non-empty elements list
assert func_1((), ['a', 'b']) == 0  # Should return 0 as there are no elements in tuple.
```

### Conclusion:
Since the function behaves correctly according to the problem description for the given test cases and the edge case tested, the conclusion is that the function is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
