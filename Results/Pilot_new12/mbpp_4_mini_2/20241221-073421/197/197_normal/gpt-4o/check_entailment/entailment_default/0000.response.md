Explanation: The code appears to follow the problem description and handles all potential cases as described. The function `func_1` correctly counts how many times each element in the list appears in the tuple by summing the counts for each element from the list found in the tuple. The output hints also confirm that the function will return 0 if the list `elements` is empty or if none of the elements are found in the tuple, which aligns with the problem description. All provided test cases produce the expected results, and there is no identified edge case where the function fails to execute correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
