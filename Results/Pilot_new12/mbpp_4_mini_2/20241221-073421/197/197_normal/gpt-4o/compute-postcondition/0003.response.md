Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `elements`. It counts how many times each element in the list appears in the tuple and returns the total count. If `elements` is empty, the function will return 0 since there are no elements to count. If `tup` contains no elements from `elements`, the function will also return 0. The function correctly handles cases where elements may appear multiple times in the tuple.**
