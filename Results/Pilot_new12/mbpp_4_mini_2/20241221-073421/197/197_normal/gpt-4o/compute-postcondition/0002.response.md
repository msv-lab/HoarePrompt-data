The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `elements`. The parameter `tup` is a tuple, and the parameter `elements` is a list of elements that may or may not be present in the tuple. The function returns the sum of the counts of each element in `elements` that are found in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and a list of elements `elements`, and return the total count of how many times the elements from the list appear in the tuple. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list of elements `elements`, returning the sum of the counts of each element in `elements` found in the tuple `tup`.**
