#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
    #The program returns the product of total_sum and the length of the list 'numbers', where total_sum is the sum of the rounded values of the elements in 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of numbers (integers or floats). It rounds each number in the list, calculates the sum of these rounded values, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the list `numbers`. If the input list is empty, the function will return 0 since the length of `numbers` would be 0, leading to a product of 0 regardless of the sum of rounded values. This behavior addresses the edge case of an empty list but does not handle the situation where non-numeric types may be present in the input list, which could lead to runtime errors.
