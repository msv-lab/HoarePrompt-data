Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter called `numbers`, which is specified to be a list of numbers (integers or floats).

2. **Rounding Numbers**: The program rounds each number in the input list using the built-in `round()` function and stores the rounded values in `rounded_numbers`.

3. **Calculating Total Sum**: It then sums the values in `rounded_numbers` using the `sum()` function, effectively calculating the total of these rounded values.

4. **Multiplying by Length**: After calculating the total sum, the function multiplies this sum by the length of the original list `numbers` (instead of the length of `rounded_numbers`).

5. **Return Value**: The function returns the computed value, which is the product of the total sum of rounded numbers and the length of the input list. 

6. **Edge Case**: The function correctly handles the edge case of an empty list since multiplying the sum (which would be `0` in this case) by `0` (the length) results in `0`. 

The function's logic is consistent with the described behavior: rounding numbers, summing them, and returning the product with the length of the list. The problem statement also allows for the assumption that the input will be valid, which is taken into account in the verification.

Overall, all operations performed in the function align with the problem requirements, confirming that the implementation is correct.
