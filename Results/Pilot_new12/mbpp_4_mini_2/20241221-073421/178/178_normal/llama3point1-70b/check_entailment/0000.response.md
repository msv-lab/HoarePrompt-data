Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly rounds each number in the input list, sums the rounded values, and then multiplies the sum by the length of the list. It handles all potential cases, including when the list is empty (which will return 0 as the sum multiplied by 0). All expected behaviors match the problem description requirements. Thus, the implementation is correct for all possible inputs.
