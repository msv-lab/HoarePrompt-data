The program correctly implements the rounding and summing of numbers in a list as per the problem description. The function rounds each number, calculates the total sum, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. 

The output hints indicate that if the input list is empty, the function will return 0 due to multiplication by the length being zero, which is indeed the correct behavior for such an edge case. 

However, the output hints also note a limitation: if non-numeric types are present in the input list, the function could raise a runtime error. Even though we assume valid input will be provided, the problem description does not explicitly state the input will always be valid or does not address how non-numeric inputs should be handled.

Given that the function could potentially fail with non-numeric types and the problem description does not account for or clarify this scenario, the function does not meet the expectations for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
