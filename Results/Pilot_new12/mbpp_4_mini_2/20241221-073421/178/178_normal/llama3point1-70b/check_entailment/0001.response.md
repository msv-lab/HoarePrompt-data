Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, computes the total sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies that sum by the length of the original list.

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Rounding**: Each number in the list is rounded using Python's built-in `round()` function.
2. **Summation**: The `sum()` function correctly computes the total of the rounded numbers.
3. **Multiplication by Length**: The total sum is then multiplied by the length of the input list, achieving the final result as described.

The implementation handles all potential cases correctly:
- If the list is empty, `len(numbers)` will be 0, leading to a return value of 0, which is appropriate.
- If the list contains negative numbers, fractions, or zero, it rounds them from their respective values correctly, adhering to the rounding rules of Python.

Since I could not find any input scenario where the program would not meet the requirements of the problem description, I confidently conclude the program is correct.
