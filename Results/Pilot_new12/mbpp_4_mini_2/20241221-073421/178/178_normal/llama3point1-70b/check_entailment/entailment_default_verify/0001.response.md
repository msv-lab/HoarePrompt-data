Final: **False**

The original assessment concluded that the program is correct based on its functionality as outlined in the problem description. However, the output hints suggest that while the function handles rounding and summation appropriately, it does not account for the potential presence of non-numeric types in the input list. This could lead to runtime errors when the rounding operation is attempted on non-numeric values, which is a valid concern under real-world usage scenarios. 

In summary, the function successfully implements the described functionality but lacks robustness against unexpected input types, resulting in a failure to meet the problem's requirements thoroughly. Thus, the program's correctness is not assured under all expected conditions, warranting an assessment of **False**.
