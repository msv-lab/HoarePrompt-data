Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Rounding Each Number**: The program uses a list comprehension to iterate through the input list `numbers`, rounding each number using the built-in `round()` function. This directly fulfills the requirement to round every number in the list.

2. **Calculating Total Sum**: After rounding, the program calculates the sum of the rounded numbers with `sum(rounded_numbers)`. This step ensures that the sum is computed for all rounded values, adhering to the problem description.

3. **Multiplying by Length of the List**: Finally, the program returns the product of the computed total sum and the length of the original list using `len(numbers)`. The problem description specifies that the result should be the total sum multiplied by the length of the list, which the program handles correctly.

Overall, the program performs all necessary steps as described in the problem, ensuring that it processes the list of numbers to return the expected output. Therefore, the implementation is deemed correct based on the given requirements.
