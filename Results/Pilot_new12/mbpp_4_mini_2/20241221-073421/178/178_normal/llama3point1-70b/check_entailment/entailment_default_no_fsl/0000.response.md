Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the situation where non-numeric types may be present in the input list. If the input list contains a non-numeric type (for example, a string), it would lead to a runtime error when attempting to round those values. While the output hints suggest the function behaves correctly with an empty list, they also indicate a potential problem with non-numeric types. Thus, considering that the program does not work correctly for every potential case, it is deemed incorrect.
