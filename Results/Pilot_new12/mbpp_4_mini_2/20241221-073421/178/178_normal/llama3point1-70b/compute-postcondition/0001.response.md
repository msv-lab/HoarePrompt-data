The value of `total_sum` is assigned the result of summing the elements of `rounded_numbers`. Since `rounded_numbers` contains the rounded values of the elements in `numbers`, `total_sum` will be the total of those rounded values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers (integers or floats), `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded values of the elements in `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of `rounded_numbers`.**
