The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list that can contain both integers and floats. The function computes `total_sum`, which is the sum of the rounded values of the elements in `numbers`, and then it returns the product of `total_sum` and the length of the list `numbers`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of numbers and return the product of the sum of the rounded values of these numbers and the length of the list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter numbers, which is a list of numbers (integers or floats), and returns the product of the sum of the rounded values of these numbers and the length of the list.**
