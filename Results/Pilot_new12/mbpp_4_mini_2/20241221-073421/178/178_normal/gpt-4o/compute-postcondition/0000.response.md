The code creates a new list called `rounded_numbers`, which contains each number in the `numbers` list rounded to the nearest integer.

If the initial state has `numbers` containing multiple numerical values (either integers or floats), `rounded_numbers` will be a list of those values, each rounded accordingly.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Thus the output state reflects the change made to `rounded_numbers` based on the contents of `numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded values of `numbers`.**
