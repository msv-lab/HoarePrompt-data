The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in the list `rounded_numbers`. The value of `total_sum` will be the total of the rounded values corresponding to the numbers in the `numbers` list. The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded values of `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numerical values, `rounded_numbers` is a list of the rounded values of `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in `rounded_numbers`.**
