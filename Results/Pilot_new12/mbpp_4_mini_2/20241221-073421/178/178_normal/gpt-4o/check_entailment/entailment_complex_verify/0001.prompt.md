You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the list contains only zeros. For example, if we call `func_1([0, 0, 0])`, the code will round the numbers (which are all already zero), resulting in a total sum of `0`. The length of the list is `3`, so the result would be `0 * 3`, which equals `0`. However, this edge case does not appear in the provided assertions and can lead to unintentional assumptions about the behavior of the function with all zeros. 

Furthermore, more negative values or specific edge cases around rounding positive or negative floating point values have not been specifically tested in the assertions. Thus, it's possible there are other cases the function might not handle as expected without further testing. Since even one potential failure case exists, the function cannot be considered correct overall.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numerical values (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns result, which is equal to total_sum multiplied by the length of the list numbers, where total_sum is the sum of the rounded values of numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter, `numbers`, which is a list of numerical values (integers or floats). It rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded values, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the original list `numbers`. The function returns this final result. 

However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input list is empty; in such cases, the function would return 0, since the length of the list is 0 and multiplying any sum by 0 results in 0. Additionally, there is no validation for the types of values within the list, meaning that if non-numeric values are included, the function would raise an error. Finally, the handling of very large numbers resulting in potential overflow is not considered, though Python generally manages large integers well. Overall, the primary actions performed by the function involve rounding, summing, and calculating a product based on the list's properties.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
