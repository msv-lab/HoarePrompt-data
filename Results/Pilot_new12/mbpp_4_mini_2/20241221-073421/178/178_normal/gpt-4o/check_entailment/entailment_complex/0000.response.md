Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` adheres to the problem description as follows:

1. **Rounding Numbers**: The function rounds each number in the input list using `round(num)`. This fulfills the requirement to round every number in the list.

2. **Calculating Total Sum**: After rounding, the function calculates the sum of the rounded numbers using `sum(rounded_numbers)`. This step is essential to find the total sum of the rounded values, as required by the problem.

3. **Multiplying by Length**: The function then multiplies the total sum by the length of the original list with `total_sum * len(numbers)`. This satisfies the requirement of printing the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the calculated result, which is the expected output as per the problem description.

5. **Valid Input Assumption**: It is assumed that the input will always be validâ€”meaning any provided list will contain numerical values (either integers or floats). Given this condition, the lack of handling for empty lists or non-numeric types does not negate the correctness as per the problem constraints.

Since the function performs all the necessary steps as dictated by the problem description, the implementation is correct in its design and expected behavior for valid inputs.
