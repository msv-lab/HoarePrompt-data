You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires the function to round every number in a given list and then print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. However, the code incorrectly calculates the total sum by multiplying it with the length of the original list, but it does not account for the scenario where the rounded values may change the total sum significantly, especially if the input list has elements that are very close to .5 when rounded.

For example, consider the input case `func_1([0.5, 1.5, 2.5])`. The rounded values would be `[1, 2, 3]`, leading to a total sum of `6`. The length of this list is `3`, resulting in `6 * 3 = 18`. However, if the function were to just sum up the original input list without rounding, we would have 0.5 + 1.5 + 2.5 = 4.5, and multiplying it by the length of the list (3) would yield `4.5 * 3 = 13.5`. 

Here, there is a clear difference between what the user expects based on the description (rounding each number and then summing) vs. what the function does. Thus the implementation does not faithfully correspond to the problem statement, making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter, `numbers`, which is a list of numerical values (integers or floats). It rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded values, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the original list `numbers`. The function returns this final result. 

However, the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input list is empty; in such cases, the function would return 0, since the length of the list is 0 and multiplying any sum by 0 results in 0. Additionally, there is no validation for the types of values within the list, meaning that if non-numeric values are included, the function would raise an error. Finally, the handling of very large numbers resulting in potential overflow is not considered, though Python generally manages large integers well. Overall, the primary actions performed by the function involve rounding, summing, and calculating a product based on the list's properties.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
