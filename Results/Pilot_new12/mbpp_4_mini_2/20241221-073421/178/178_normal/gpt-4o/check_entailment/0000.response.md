Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires the function to round every number in a given list and then print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. However, the code incorrectly calculates the total sum by multiplying it with the length of the original list, but it does not account for the scenario where the rounded values may change the total sum significantly, especially if the input list has elements that are very close to .5 when rounded.

For example, consider the input case `func_1([0.5, 1.5, 2.5])`. The rounded values would be `[1, 2, 3]`, leading to a total sum of `6`. The length of this list is `3`, resulting in `6 * 3 = 18`. However, if the function were to just sum up the original input list without rounding, we would have 0.5 + 1.5 + 2.5 = 4.5, and multiplying it by the length of the list (3) would yield `4.5 * 3 = 13.5`. 

Here, there is a clear difference between what the user expects based on the description (rounding each number and then summing) vs. what the function does. Thus the implementation does not faithfully correspond to the problem statement, making it incorrect.
