Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the steps described in the problem description:

1. It takes a list of numerical values (either integers or floats) as input.
2. It rounds each number in the list using the `round()` function.
3. It calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers.
4. It multiplies the total sum by the length of the original list of numbers.
5. It returns the final result.

The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as tests to validate that the function `func_1` produces the expected output for the given lists of numbers, demonstrating that the function behaves as intended for various inputs. Each assertion checks that the correctness of the output matches the expected value.

Overall, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for any valid input, thus ensuring its correctness.
