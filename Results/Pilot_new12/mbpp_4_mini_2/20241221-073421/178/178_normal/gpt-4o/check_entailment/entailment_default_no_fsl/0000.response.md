Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case of an empty list. According to the problem description, if the input list of numbers is empty, the program should return a specific value based on the requirements, but in the current implementation, it returns 0 due to multiplying the sum (which is also 0) by the length of the list (0). This behavior does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description since it is not defined what should happen for an empty input.

Additionally, there is no error handling for non-numeric values within the input list, which could lead to unexpected crashes if invalid data is provided, despite the assumption of valid input. 

Thus, the function does not fulfill the problem description requirements for every potential case, leading to an incorrect assessment of correctness.
