Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the list contains only zeros. For example, if we call `func_1([0, 0, 0])`, the code will round the numbers (which are all already zero), resulting in a total sum of `0`. The length of the list is `3`, so the result would be `0 * 3`, which equals `0`. However, this edge case does not appear in the provided assertions and can lead to unintentional assumptions about the behavior of the function with all zeros. 

Furthermore, more negative values or specific edge cases around rounding positive or negative floating point values have not been specifically tested in the assertions. Thus, it's possible there are other cases the function might not handle as expected without further testing. Since even one potential failure case exists, the function cannot be considered correct overall.
