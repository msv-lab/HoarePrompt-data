The provided program, `func_1`, aims to round every number in a given list, calculate the total sum of these rounded values, and then multiply that sum by the length of the list. 

The output hints clarify that the function correctly rounds the numbers, sums them, and then multiplies by the list length. However, the function doesn't explicitly handle an empty list scenario. While it returns a sum of 0 when the input list is empty—due to multiplying by the length of the list being 0—the problem description does not specify how to handle such a case. Therefore, the absence of handling for empty lists raises a concern as to whether it fully meets the expectations outlined in the problem description. 

Moreover, although it is stated that the input will be valid, if we assume that the function should gracefully handle various edge cases or invalid inputs, the lack of explicit type validation or empty list handling could be viewed as a flaw.

Given that the program does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case (specifically, the empty list situation), the program is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
