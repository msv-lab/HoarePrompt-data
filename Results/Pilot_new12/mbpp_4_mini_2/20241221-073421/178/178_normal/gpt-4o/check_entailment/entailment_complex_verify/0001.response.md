The original Assessment states that the program's correctness is **False**, highlighting concerns about its handling of edge cases, particularly when the input list contains only zeros or negative values. It emphasizes that even a single potential failure case can render the function incorrect overall.

Upon reviewing the annotated code and the program behavior according to the problem description, I note that the function `func_1` is designed to round the numbers, sum them, and multiply by the length of the list. The annotations clarify that the input is assumed to be a valid list of numerical values, which aligns with the problem description.

The concern raised in the original assessment regarding the output when the input is all zeros is valid; however, it is consistent with the expected behavior outlined in the problem description. When the function receives `[0, 0, 0]`, it correctly returns `0`, which is consistent with the function's logic. 

Furthermore, regarding other edge cases mentioned, such as negative values, there is nothing inherently incorrect about the function's logic. It will round these values, sum them properly, and multiply by the length of the list as designed.

The original assessment fails to consider that the program strictly adheres to the problem description, producing results as expected for the assertions provided. While edge cases might exist, they do not necessarily invalidate the function's correctness in light of the problem's stated requirements.

Given all this information, I conclude that the program correctly implements the task described in the problem statement and handles standard cases adequately.

Final: **True**
