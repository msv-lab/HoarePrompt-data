Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description. The annotated version reinforces this by clarifying that before the function is called, the input `lists` is guaranteed to be a list of lists containing numerical elements. The use of `max(lists, key=sum)` appropriately identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum, handling all outlined scenarios correctly (including multiple lists, empty sublists, and cases with identical max sums). Thus, the implementation meets the problem's requirements as stated.
