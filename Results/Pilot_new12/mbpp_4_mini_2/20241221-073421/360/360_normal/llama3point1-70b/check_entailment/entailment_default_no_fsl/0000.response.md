Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case when the input list `lists` is empty. According to the output hints, it should raise a `ValueError` if there are no sublists to evaluate. However, the current implementation will raise a `ValueError` when calling `max()` on an empty list without any handling for this case, but it doesn't explicitly address this in the function as described. Thus, if an empty list is passed, the program will not perform as expected and will result in an unhandled situation.

For instance, calling `func_1([])` would raise an exception, which does not align with a proper handling as stated in the hints. Therefore, the program is not correct for every potential case, particularly when the input is an empty list.
