Based on the provided problem description and the annotated version of the program, I will evaluate the correctness of the program.

### Problem Description
The requirement is to write a function that returns a sublist from a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

### Program Analysis
The function `func_1(lists)` utilizes the `max` function with the `key` set to `sum`, which correctly identifies the sublist in `lists` with the highest sum of its elements.

### Edge Cases
- The function does not handle the empty list scenario, which would raise a `ValueError`. However, it's noted in the assessment that we're assuming valid inputs, meaning that we are taking it for granted that `lists` will not be empty when passed to the function.
- If presented with multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, the function will return the first encountered, which is acceptable based on the problem description.

### Annotations and Conclusions
The annotated code clearly states that the function operates correctly under the assumption that it is given valid input, specifically that `lists` is a list of lists containing numerical elements. The function behavior as described in the annotations aligns with the requirements in the problem description.

The original assessment noted the function's inadequacy in handling empty input, but since we've established that such scenarios are not to be tested based on provided assumptions, we can conclude that the assessment may have overstated the issue.

### Final Assessment
Given that the function behaves correctly for the valid inputs and outputs specified in the problem description, and considering the provided annotations, the original assessment can be revised. 

Final: **True**
