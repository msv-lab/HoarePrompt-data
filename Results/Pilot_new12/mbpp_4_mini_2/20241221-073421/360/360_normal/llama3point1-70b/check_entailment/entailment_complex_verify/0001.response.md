Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description. The annotations provide a clear understanding of the program's behavior, indicating that it accepts a valid list of lists containing numerical elements and returns the sublist with the maximum sum. 

All potential edge cases are accounted for:
1. The function will handle multiple sublists with different sums and return the one with the highest sum.
2. Empty sublists are treated appropriately, with any empty list returning as the first occurrence of a higher sum if available.
3. If all sublists are empty, the function returns the first empty sublist, aligning with expectations.

Thus, the program's behavior is consistent with the problem description, and the annotations support the correctness. The assumptions about valid input further solidify the assessment's conclusion, confirming that the function behaves as intended.
