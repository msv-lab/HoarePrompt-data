Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description. It takes a list of lists as input and uses the built-in `max` function with `key=sum` to return the sublist whose sum of elements is the highest.

This implementation will correctly handle various scenarios, including:

1. **Multiple Lists with Different Sums**: If there are multiple sublists with varying sums, the function will return the one with the highest sum.
2. **Empty Sublists**: If any of the sublists are empty, their sum will be 0. The function will handle this correctly and return the first occurrence of a non-empty sublist with a higher sum.
3. **All Sublists Empty**: If all sublists are empty, the function will return the first empty list since that's the only option available.
4. **Identical Max Sums**: If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, `max` will return the first occurrence of such a sublist.

Considered all potential cases and edge cases, the function performs correctly according to the problem description.
