The provided function is designed to return the sublist from a list of lists that has the highest sum of its elements. The output hints indicate that if the input list is empty, a ValueError is raised. Also, if there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it should return the first one encountered.

Examining the code:
```python
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
```
The `max()` function with the `key=sum` argument correctly identifies the sublist with the maximum sum. However, there is a significant issue regarding what happens when the input `lists` is empty. If `lists` is empty, the `max()` function will raise a `ValueError` since there is no element to compare. 

Since the problem statement specifies that the function should handle an empty input properly, the current implementation does not satisfy this condition appropriately.

Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function uses Python's `max()` function to find the list with the maximum sum. While it functions correctly for non-empty lists, it does not handle the case when `lists` is empty, which results in a `ValueError`. This is a violation of the specifications in the problem description, making the program incorrect.
