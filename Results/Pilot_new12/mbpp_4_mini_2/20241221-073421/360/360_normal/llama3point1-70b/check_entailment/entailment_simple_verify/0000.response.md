The original assessment states that the program does not handle the case when the input list is empty and thus is incorrect. However, the annotated version indicates that the program is designed to work with the assumption that the input is valid, specifically stating that "lists is a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats)." 

Given this assumption that the input will always be valid (not empty), the program correctly identifies the sub-list with the highest sum using Python's built-in `max` function with `key=sum`. In this context, the program meets the problem description requirements as it focuses solely on valid inputs and functions properly across the expected scenarios.

Since the original assessment's focus was on potential edge cases (empty lists), which have been deemed irrelevant based on the premise of valid input, the justification for labeling the program as incorrect in those scenarios does not apply.

Therefore, considering the annotation and the emphasis on valid input, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
