Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies the `func_1` function as implementing the requirements laid out in the problem description. The function takes a list of lists and correctly returns the sublist with the highest sum by utilizing Python's built-in `max()` function with `key=sum`. 

The output hints also confirm that:
1. The function appropriately handles a list of lists containing numerical elements.
2. It returns the correct sublist when multiple sublists exist with varying sums.
3. It properly addresses edge cases, such as empty sublists and multiple sublists with identical maximum sums.
4. The program raises a `ValueError` for an empty input list, which is a reasonable behavior given that there would be no sublists to evaluate.

All of these factors align with the original assessment that the program is correct, as it meets the problem's requirements and correctly handles various input scenarios as expected. Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is justified.
