You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it based on the problem description.

**Problem description:** Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
```

### Analysis

1. **Functionality**: The program uses the `max` function with the `key` parameter set to `sum`. This means that it looks for the sub-list in `lists` that has the highest sum of its elements.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `lists` is empty, `max(lists, key=sum)` will raise a `ValueError` since `max` requires at least one element to operate on.
   - If there are multiple sub-lists that have the same maximum sum, `max` will return the first one encountered, which appears to comply with the requirements, but is a detail that should be acknowledged.

3. **Non-ideal Cases**: 
   - The function does not handle the scenario where the input is an empty list, which is a valid edge case mentioned in the problem description. It should ideally return `None` or an empty list or indicate that the input was invalid.

Given that the program does not handle the case where the input list is empty, this shows that it does not meet the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats).
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns the sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter 'lists', which is a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats). It returns the sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its elements. If 'lists' is empty, the function will raise a ValueError since there are no sublists to evaluate. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns the first one encountered.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
