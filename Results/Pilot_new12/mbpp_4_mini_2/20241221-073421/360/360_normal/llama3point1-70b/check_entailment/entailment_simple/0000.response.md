Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement of the problem description, which asks for a function that returns the sublist from a list of lists where the sum of its elements is the highest. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(lists)` uses the `max()` function with the `key=sum` argument. This effectively evaluates each sublist in `lists`, calculating the sum of its elements, and then returns the sublist that has the highest sum.

2. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The problem states that we can assume the input will always be valid. This means that we do not need to handle any exceptions or errors related to the input type or structure. As such, we can trust that `lists` will always contain valid numerical lists.

3. **Edge Cases**: Since we are assuming valid input with numerical elements, the return value will always involve finding a maximum from a valid list of lists. In case of ties (multiple sublists with the same maximum sum), the `max()` function will return the first one encountered, which is acceptable based on the problem description.

4. **Correctness Across Scenarios**: Since the function employs built-in functions effectively and correctly accumulates sums and finds the maximum, it will consistently produce the desired output for any valid case as described in the problem statement.

Therefore, the provided program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
