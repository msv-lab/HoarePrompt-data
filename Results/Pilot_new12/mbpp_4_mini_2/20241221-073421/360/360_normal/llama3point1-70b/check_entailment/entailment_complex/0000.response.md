Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` takes a parameter `lists`, which is indeed a list of lists containing numerical elements (either integers or floats).

2. **Finding the Maximum Sum**: The use of `max(lists, key=sum)` accurately identifies the sublist with the highest sum of its elements. This aligns perfectly with the requirement of the problem, which specifies returning the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: While it mentions that if `lists` is empty, a `ValueError` will be raised, the problem description does not specify handling empty lists. We assume valid input is provided. Thus, for valid non-empty input, the function will operate correctly.

4. **Multiple Sublists with Same Sum**: The program correctly handles the scenario where multiple sublists have the same maximum sum by returning the first one encountered, as intended.

In conclusion, the program behaves as specified in the problem description for all valid inputs, fulfilling the requirements consistently.
