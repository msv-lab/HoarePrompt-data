#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats).
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns the sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter 'lists', which is a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats). It returns the sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its elements. If 'lists' is empty, the function will raise a ValueError since there are no sublists to evaluate. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns the first one encountered.
