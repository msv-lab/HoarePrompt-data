The function accepts a parameter 'lists', which is a list of lists containing numerical elements (integers or floats). It returns the sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its elements. If 'lists' is empty, the function will raise a ValueError since there are no sublists to evaluate. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns the first one encountered.
