`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `sublist`. The variable `max_sum` remains negative infinity, `max_list` remains an empty list, and `list_of_lists` still contains at least one sublist. The value of `current_sum` can vary depending on the contents of `sublist`, but it will be the total of those elements. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 sublist, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
