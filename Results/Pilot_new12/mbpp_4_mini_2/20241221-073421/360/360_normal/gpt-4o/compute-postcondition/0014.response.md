The statement updates `current_sum` to be the sum of `sublist`. Since `current_sum` is assigned the value of `sum(sublist)`, we note that `current_sum` becomes equal to the sum of the elements in `sublist`. The variables `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged, and the value of `sublist` is still valid. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is negative infinity or greater, `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, `sublist` is still the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is negative infinity or greater, `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
