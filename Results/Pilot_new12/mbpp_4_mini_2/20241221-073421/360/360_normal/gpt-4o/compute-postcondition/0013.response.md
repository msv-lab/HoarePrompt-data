According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. If there are more sublists in the `list_of_lists`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `max_sum` is either negative infinity or greater, `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`, and `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `sublist` must refer to the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Assuming that `sublist` refers to the current sublist being processed from `list_of_lists`, and that `list_of_lists` has at least one more sublist left to iterate over:

State: **`max_sum` is negative infinity or greater, `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
