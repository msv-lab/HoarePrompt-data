The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. In the initial state, `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`, and `sublist` is defined as the next sublist in `list_of_lists`. The values of `max_sum` and `current_sum` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the new value of `max_list`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` (sum of `sublist`), `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
