The code assigns `current_sum` to `max_sum`. The value assigned to `max_sum` will be equal to `current_sum`, which is the sum of `sublist`. Since `max_sum` can initially be negative infinity or greater, after this assignment, `max_sum` will no longer be less than `current_sum`, and its new value will reflect the total of `sublist`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` (sum of `sublist`), `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
