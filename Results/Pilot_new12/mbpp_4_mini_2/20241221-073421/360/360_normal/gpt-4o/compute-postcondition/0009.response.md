`current_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the elements in `sublist`. The value of `sublist` could be a list of numbers, which determines the value of `current_sum`. The states of the other variables are not affected, but we know that `max_sum` is still negative infinity or greater, and `max_list` remains either empty or equal to `sublist`. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is negative infinity or greater, `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is negative infinity or greater, `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`**.
