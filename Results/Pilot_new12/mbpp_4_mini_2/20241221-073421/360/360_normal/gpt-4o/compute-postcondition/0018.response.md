Output State: **`max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the sublist that corresponds to `max_sum`, and `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of integers. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_sum` remains negative infinity, and `max_list` remains an empty list.**
