The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. Given that `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is greater than `max_sum`, we know that the assignment is valid and `max_list` will contain the values of `sublist`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is greater than negative infinity; `max_list` is equal to `sublist`; `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist; `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, which is greater than negative infinity; `max_list` is equal to `sublist`; `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist; `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum.**
