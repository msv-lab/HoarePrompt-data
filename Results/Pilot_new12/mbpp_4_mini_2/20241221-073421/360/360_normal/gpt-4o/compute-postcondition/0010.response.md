The value of `max_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`. The initial state specifies that `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`. Since `max_sum` can be negative infinity or greater, it will now take the value of `current_sum`, which is the sum of the given sublist. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so we can represent the output state accordingly. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` (which is equal to `sum(sublist)`), `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`, `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`**
