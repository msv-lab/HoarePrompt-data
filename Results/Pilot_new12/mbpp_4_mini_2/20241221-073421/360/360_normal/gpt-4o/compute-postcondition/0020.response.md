The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the program returns the sublist that corresponds to the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the return value is an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sublists (each consisting of integers) and return the sublist with the maximum sum or an empty list if no sublists exist. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, and returns the sublist with the maximum sum of integers. If list_of_lists is empty, it returns an empty list.**
