Postcondition: ***`max_sum` is negative infinity or greater, `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`, and `current_sum` is equal to `sum(sublist)`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to be equal to `current_sum`, and `max_list` is updated to be equal to `sublist`.***
