According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` has at least one additional sublist, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `max_sum` is negative infinity or greater, and `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, we must have `max_list` set to a new sublist from `list_of_lists`. Assuming `list_of_lists` has at least one sublist remaining, the loop will iterate over the next sublist.

State: **`max_sum` is negative infinity or greater, `max_list` is either empty or equal to `sublist`, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`**
