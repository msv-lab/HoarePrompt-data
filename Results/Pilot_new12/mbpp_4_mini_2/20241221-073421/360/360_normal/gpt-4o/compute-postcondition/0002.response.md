According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist, the loop will execute. The states that need to be confirmed for the loop to execute are that `list_of_lists` must not be empty, `max_sum` remains as negative infinity to ensure proper comparison within the loop, and `max_list` is initialized as an empty list before the loop starts. 

For the purpose of executing the loop: `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist. 

State: **`max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 sublist**
