Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists of integers. It calculates the sum of each sublist and identifies the sublist that has the highest sum. The function returns this sublist as the output. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return an empty list, as no sublists are available to sum. The function does not currently handle the case where multiple sublists have the same maximum sum; in such cases, it will return the first sublist found with that sum.**
