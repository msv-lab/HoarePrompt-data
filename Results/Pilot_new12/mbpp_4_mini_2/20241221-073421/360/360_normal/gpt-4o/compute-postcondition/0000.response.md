The variable `max_sum` is assigned the value of negative infinity, indicated by `float('-inf')`. This means `max_sum` will now hold the minimum possible value for a floating-point number, which is useful for computations that involve finding a maximum sum in the future steps. The states of the other variables are not affected since this is a direct assignment.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist is a list of integers; `max_sum` is negative infinity.**
