You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11, 12], [7, 8, 9]]) == [10, 11, 12]
assert func_1([[3, 2, 1], [6, 5, 4], [12, 11, 10]]) == [12, 11, 10]
assert func_1([[2, 3, 1]]) == [2, 3, 1]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
    return max_list


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the program based on the provided problem description, we can review the logic of the function `func_1` which aims to return the sublist with the highest sum from a list of lists.

The program is structured as follows:

1. It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list.
2. It iterates through each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`.
3. For each sublist, it calculates the `current_sum`.
4. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and assigns `max_list` to the current sublist.
5. Finally, it returns `max_list`.

Now let's assess the correctness with specific edge cases:

1. **Single empty sublist**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where an empty sublist is present. For example, `func_1([[]])` would initialize `max_sum` to negative infinity but calculating `current_sum` for the empty list would yield `0`. Thus, `max_list` will not be updated and will remain an empty list, which contradicts the expectation that it should return a list (even if empty) as per input format.

2. **All empty sublists**: If the input is `func_1([[], [], []])`, the function would also return an empty list, which may not align with the intention to provide the "list in a list of lists" whose sum is the highest, as they all sum to `0`.

3. **Equal maximum sums**: If there are multiple sublists with the same highest sum, the program only returns the last one encountered in the input list. For example, `func_1([[1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 0], [0, 3]])` has the sums of `3, 3, 3, 3` respectively. The expected behavior might need clarification in the problem statement on how to handle ties, as the function will return `[0, 3]` (last with the max sum), which may not be universally acceptable.

These edge cases demonstrate that the implementation is not fully robust in handling all scenarios potentially implied by the problem description. Thus, the correctness is called into question because there are cases where the function does not behave as expected.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists of integers. It calculates the sum of each sublist and identifies the sublist that has the highest sum. The function returns this sublist as the output. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return an empty list, as no sublists are available to sum. The function does not currently handle the case where multiple sublists have the same maximum sum; in such cases, it will return the first sublist found with that sum.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
