Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it faithfully implements the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (where each sublist contains integers) and returns the sublist whose sum of elements is the highest.

Hereâ€™s how the program meets the problem requirements:

1. **Iteration through sublists**: The function iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists` and computes the sum of the elements in each sublist.

2. **Comparison for maximum sum**: It maintains a variable `max_sum` initialized to negative infinity to track the highest sum encountered so far and `max_list` to store the corresponding sublist. Whenever the sum of the current sublist (`current_sum`) exceeds `max_sum`, it updates both `max_sum` and `max_list`.

3. **Return statement**: At the end of the function, it returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the highest sum. If `list_of_lists` is empty, it correctly returns an empty list as `max_list`, which is the expected behavior.

Since the program correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum according to the description, it meets all required conditions and handles potential cases as per the stated assumptions about valid input. Thus, it behaves as expected for all specified input scenarios.
