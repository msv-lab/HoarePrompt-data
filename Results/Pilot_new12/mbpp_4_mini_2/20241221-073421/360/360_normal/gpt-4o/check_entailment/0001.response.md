Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the function that finds and returns the sublist from a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. The logic used in the function `func_1` is as follows:

1. It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity to handle any possible sums and to ensure that even the lowest sums will update it.
2. It iterates through each sublist in the provided `list_of_lists`.
3. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements.
4. If the sum of the current sublist is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and also updates `max_list` to the current sublist.
5. Finally, it returns `max_list` which contains the sublist with the highest sum.

The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases that verify the function behaves as expected for different inputs, demonstrating that the function correctly identifies the sublist with the highest sum in those specific cases.

Since I haven't identified any possible cases where this implementation fails (including edge scenarios such as empty lists or variations in list sizes), the program appears to be correct and satisfactorily meets the problem description requirements.
