To analyze the program based on the provided problem description, we can review the logic of the function `func_1` which aims to return the sublist with the highest sum from a list of lists.

The program is structured as follows:

1. It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list.
2. It iterates through each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`.
3. For each sublist, it calculates the `current_sum`.
4. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and assigns `max_list` to the current sublist.
5. Finally, it returns `max_list`.

Now let's assess the correctness with specific edge cases:

1. **Single empty sublist**: The program does not explicitly handle cases where an empty sublist is present. For example, `func_1([[]])` would initialize `max_sum` to negative infinity but calculating `current_sum` for the empty list would yield `0`. Thus, `max_list` will not be updated and will remain an empty list, which contradicts the expectation that it should return a list (even if empty) as per input format.

2. **All empty sublists**: If the input is `func_1([[], [], []])`, the function would also return an empty list, which may not align with the intention to provide the "list in a list of lists" whose sum is the highest, as they all sum to `0`.

3. **Equal maximum sums**: If there are multiple sublists with the same highest sum, the program only returns the last one encountered in the input list. For example, `func_1([[1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 0], [0, 3]])` has the sums of `3, 3, 3, 3` respectively. The expected behavior might need clarification in the problem statement on how to handle ties, as the function will return `[0, 3]` (last with the max sum), which may not be universally acceptable.

These edge cases demonstrate that the implementation is not fully robust in handling all scenarios potentially implied by the problem description. Thus, the correctness is called into question because there are cases where the function does not behave as expected.

Correctness: **False**.
