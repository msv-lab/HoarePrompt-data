The program aims to identify the sublist with the highest sum from a list of lists, as specified in the problem description. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` appears sound as it:

1. Initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity to ensure any valid sum will update it.
2. Iterates through each sublist, calculating the sum.
3. Compares the current sum to `max_sum` and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` accordingly.

However, the original assessment raised crucial points about the program's failure to handle certain edge cases:

1. It does not return an appropriate value when the input is an empty list of lists or contains empty sublists. Both scenarios lead to the return of an empty list, which contradicts the expectation of returning the sublist with the highest sum.
2. In cases where multiple sublists yield the same maximum sum, the program will return the last such sublist encountered, as opposed to a clearly defined behavior for such scenarios. The problem description does not clarify how to handle ties, which adds ambiguity to the expected output.

Furthermore, the output hints confirm that the program will return an empty list for an empty input and does not address the equal maximum sums case. Given that the original assessment highlighted significant inadequacies in handling these edge cases, I concur that these issues impact the program's overall correctness and make the implementation insufficiently robust for all potential inputs described in the problem.

Thus, the reasoning presented in the original assessment is valid due to these inconsistencies.

Final: **False**.
