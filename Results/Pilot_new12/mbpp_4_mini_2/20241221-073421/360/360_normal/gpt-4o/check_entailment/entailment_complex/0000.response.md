Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description, which involves returning the sublist from a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. Hereâ€™s how it aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a single parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of integer sublists. It assumes the input will be valid, which aligns with the provided assumptions.

2. **Calculating Sums**: The function iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists` and calculates the sum of its elements. This is done using the built-in `sum()` function, correctly implementing the core requirement of the problem.

3. **Tracking Maximum**: The function maintains two variables: `max_sum`, initialized to negative infinity (to ensure any sum will be larger initially), and `max_list`, which holds the sublist that has the highest sum found so far.

4. **Updating Max Values**: Inside the loop, if the current sublist sum exceeds `max_sum`, it updates both `max_sum` and `max_list` to reflect the new highest sum and its corresponding sublist.

5. **Return Value**: After completing the iteration through all sublists, the function returns `max_list`, which will contain the sublist with the highest sum. If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_list` remains an empty list, as expected.

6. **Behavior with Ties**: Although the function does not specify behavior in the context of ties (multiple sublists having the same maximum sum), the problem description does not require it to handle this case. The function satisfies the requirement to return the corresponding sublist with the highest sum, which is what is requested.

Overall, the logic and functionality of the given code align perfectly with the problem description, thus confirming its correctness.
