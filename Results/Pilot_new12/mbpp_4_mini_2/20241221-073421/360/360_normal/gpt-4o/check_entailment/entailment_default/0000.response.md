Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: While the code properly identifies the sublist with the highest sum and returns it in cases where the input list of lists is valid, it does not handle the case where multiple sublists have the same maximum sum. The output hints clarify that the function will return the first sublist found with the maximum sum, which might not align with the expectation of returning all sublists with the maximum sum if the problem description implied that as a requirement. Additionally, the function does not specify what to return if `list_of_lists` is empty, and it defaults to returning an empty list. Since the program fails to address the requirement of handling multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it is considered incorrect.
