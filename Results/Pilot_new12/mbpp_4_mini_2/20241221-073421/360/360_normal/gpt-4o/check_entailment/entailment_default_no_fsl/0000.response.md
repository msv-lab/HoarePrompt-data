Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where multiple sublists have the same maximum sum. According to the problem description, it is implied that the function should return the sublist with the highest sum, but in the event of ties, there is no specification on which sublist to return. The output hints confirm that the function currently returns the first sublist found with the maximum sum, which does not align with the expectation of returning "the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest" comprehensively.

For example, given the input `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [10, 11], [5, 16]]`, both `[10, 11]` and `[5, 16]` yield the same sum of 21, but the program will consistently return the first encountered sublist `[10, 11]`, which might not be the intended behavior if the user expected some form of preference or particular selection criteria when sums are equal.

Thus, as it stands, the function can yield different results based on the order of the sublists in the input, and this inconsistency makes it incorrect as per the problem description.
