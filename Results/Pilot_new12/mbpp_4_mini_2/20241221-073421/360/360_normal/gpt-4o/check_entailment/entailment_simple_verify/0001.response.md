Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The logic of the function `func_1` is clear, and the annotations provide a detailed breakdown of its behavior at key points. The program initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity, ensuring it can accept any sums calculated from the provided sublists. It iterates correctly, computes the sums, and updates the maximum when necessary.

The original assessment accurately identified these points and stated that the function produces the expected results based on the assertions provided. Additionally, the annotations confirm that before executing the return, `max_list` will correctly hold the sublist with the highest sum, and if `list_of_lists` is empty, it would simply return an empty list, which is an acceptable behavior given the problem constraints.

The assertions serve as valid test cases that cover multiple scenarios and demonstrate that the function behaves as intended. As all aspects align with the expectations set forth in the problem description, the original assessment remains justified.
