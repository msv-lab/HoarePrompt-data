The original assessment correctly identified several potential issues with the implementation of the function `func_1`. It raises valid points about edge cases, such as handling empty sublists or cases where multiple sublists have equal sums. 

1. **Handling of empty sublists**: The fact that the program does not explicitly address inputs like `[[]]` or `[[], [], []]` leads to the function returning an empty list rather than an appropriate response (which could be a proper handling of the input, such as returning the empty list or a validity error). The original assessment accurately notes that the function's behavior varies based on the input structure and does not comply with an expected behavior if empty lists are part of the input.

2. **Handling of equal maximum sums**: The original assessment highlights that when multiple sublists have the same maximum sum, the function returns the last one encountered. This behavior might not align with a reasonable expectation set in the problem description about how to handle ties for the maximum sum.

The annotations confirm that the main logic of the function is to find the sublist with the highest sum; however, they do not mitigate the concerns raised in the original assessment. Specifically, they highlight states where variables are set, but do not address how the function behaves in edge cases related to empty or equal sum sublists.

Given these considerations, I conclude that the original assessment providing a correctness rating of **False** still holds, as the function does not robustly handle all scenarios implied by the problem description. 

Final: **False**
