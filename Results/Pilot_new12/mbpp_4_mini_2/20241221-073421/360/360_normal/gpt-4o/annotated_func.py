#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist is a list of integers.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_sum` is the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the sublist that corresponds to `max_sum`, and `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of integers. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_sum` remains negative infinity, and `max_list` remains an empty list.
    return max_list
    #The program returns the sublist that corresponds to the maximum sum of all sublists in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is empty, `max_list` remains an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists of integers. It calculates the sum of each sublist and identifies the sublist that has the highest sum. The function returns this sublist as the output. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return an empty list, as no sublists are available to sum. The function does not currently handle the case where multiple sublists have the same maximum sum; in such cases, it will return the first sublist found with that sum.
