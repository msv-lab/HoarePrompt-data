#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a new list of lists where each sublist from 'list_of_lists' is sorted in a case-insensitive manner
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner. The implementation does not handle potential edge cases such as empty sublists, or the input being not a list of lists, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The function assumes that all elements in the sublists are strings and does not account for other data types, which may result in errors during sorting.
