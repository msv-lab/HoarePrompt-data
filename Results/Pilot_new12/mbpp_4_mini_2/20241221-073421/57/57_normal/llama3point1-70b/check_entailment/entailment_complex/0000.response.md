Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description, which is to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. 

Hereâ€™s how it satisfies the requirements:

1. **Input Structure**: The function, `func_1`, accepts a parameter `list_of_lists` that is specified as a list of lists containing strings. 
   
2. **Sorting Mechanism**: Within the function, a list comprehension is used to iterate over each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`. The `sorted()` function is applied to each `sublist`, with `key=str.lower` ensuring that the sorting is done in a case-insensitive manner, which is appropriate for sorting strings.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list that contains sorted sublists, thus fulfilling the requirement that each sublist of strings is sorted.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although the function does not explicitly handle empty sublists or validate input types, the problem assumes valid input will be provided. Therefore, in the context of the given problem, the function operates correctly as it does not receive input that could cause it to fail.

In summary, the implementation carries out the defined task of sorting each sublist of strings correctly and according to the specifications provided in the problem description, which leads to the conclusion that it is correct.
