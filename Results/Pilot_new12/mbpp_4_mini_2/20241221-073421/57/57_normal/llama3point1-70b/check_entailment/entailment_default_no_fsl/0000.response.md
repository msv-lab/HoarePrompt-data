Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle potential edge cases such as empty sublists. For example, if the input `list_of_lists` contains a sublist like `[]`, the code will return `[]` for that sublist. This does not affect the output since an empty sublist would still be considered sorted, but the output hints suggest there are concerns regarding the function not handling different types (e.g., non-string elements), which could lead to unexpected behavior. 

Additionally, the program assumes all elements in the sublists are strings, but if any sublist contains non-string items (e.g., integers, None), the `sorted()` function will fail and raise a TypeError. This leads to the conclusion that the function does not fulfill all the requirements since it can't robustly handle cases where the data types in the sublists are unexpected.

Thus, since the function can encounter errors and does not account for all input scenarios as implicitly suggested by the output hints, its correctness is demonstrated to be **False**.
