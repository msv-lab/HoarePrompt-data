Based on the problem description, the program is intended to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The implementation correctly uses Python's `sorted` function with `key=str.lower` to achieve case-insensitive sorting for each sublist.

However, the output hints indicate that there are potential shortcomings in the implementation:

1. The function does not explicitly handle edge cases like empty sublists or the input not being a valid list of lists.
2. The implementation assumes that all elements in the sublists are strings, and it does not address situations where other data types might be present, which could cause errors during sorting.

Despite the program functioning correctly under normal assumptions, the limitations highlighted in the output hints suggest that unexpected input scenarios could lead to errors.

Taking these considerations into account, the original assessment of "Correctness: True" does not fully align with the nuances outlined in the output hints. The programâ€™s execution handling for edge cases and type assumptions is inadequate.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **False**
