Based on the analysis of the problem description, the program, the original assessment, and the provided output hints, I will clarify the assessment.

The program `func_1` is intended to sort each sublist of strings within a list of lists in a case-insensitive manner. The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **True** based on its handling of sorting and special cases.

However, the output hints suggest that while the function generally performs sorting correctly, it does not address edge cases effectively, such as handling empty sublists or non-string elements within sublists. This is crucial, as the program was designed under the assumption that all elements are strings and that the input format is a valid list of lists.

Given these considerations:

1. While the original assessment mentions the expected behavior of the function, the hints indicate that the program could lead to unexpected behavior under certain circumstances, like processing an empty sublist or other data types.

2. The original assessment fails to acknowledge these potential edge cases and the inherent limitations in the program concerning input robustness.

Because the hints highlight issues that could lead to incorrect outputs and the assumptions made by the original assessment, it warrants a reevaluation.

Final: **False**
