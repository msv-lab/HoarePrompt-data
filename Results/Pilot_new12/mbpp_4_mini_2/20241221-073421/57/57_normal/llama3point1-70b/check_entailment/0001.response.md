Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to sort each sublist of strings within a given list of lists. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The program uses the `sorted()` function which sorts the elements of a list. The `key=str.lower` indicates that the sorting should be case-insensitive, meaning that it will treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equal when deciding the order.

2. **Special Cases**:
   - Empty sublists will return an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
   - Lists with mixed case strings (e.g., ["apple", "Banana", "pear"]) will be sorted correctly regardless of their case.
   - Sublists containing numeric strings will also be sorted lexicographically in accordance with Python's default sorting behavior.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: The function should work for any list of lists containing strings, ensuring that all inputs adhere to the expected structure.

Since there's no case where the function does not meet the described requirements, the correctness of the program is confirmed as true.
