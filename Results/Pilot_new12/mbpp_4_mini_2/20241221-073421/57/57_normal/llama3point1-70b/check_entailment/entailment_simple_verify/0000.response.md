Final: **True** 

The program's logic correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, sorting each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The annotated version verifies that `list_of_lists` is a valid input type and confirms that the sorting is done in a case-insensitive manner using `key=str.lower`, which aligns with the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program by acknowledging its handling of edge cases, such as empty sublists and lists with mixed case strings. Since the provided annotations support the program's behavior and confirm its compliance with the problem description, the conclusion reaffirming the program's correctness is valid.
