Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly sorts each sublist of strings within a given list of lists. It utilizes the `sorted` function with the `key` parameter set to `str.lower`, ensuring that the sorting is case-insensitive. The program handles various edge cases, such as empty sublists, lists with mixed case strings, and lists with a single string, all of which are appropriately managed by the sorting mechanism. 

Since I cannot find an example where the program fails to meet the problem description, it is correct.
