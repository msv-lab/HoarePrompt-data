Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) where each sublist is expected to contain strings. It then returns a new list of these sublists, with each sublist being sorted in a case-insensitive manner. 

The use of `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` ensures that the sorting is done without taking case differences into account. This aligns with the requirement to sort the strings in each sublist. 

Additionally, since the program assumes valid input, it does not need to handle cases such as empty lists or invalid data types. Therefore, it meets the expectations outlined in the problem description.
