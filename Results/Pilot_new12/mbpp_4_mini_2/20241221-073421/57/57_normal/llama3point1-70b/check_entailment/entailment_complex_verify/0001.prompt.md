You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to sort each sublist of strings within a given list of lists. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The program uses the `sorted()` function which sorts the elements of a list. The `key=str.lower` indicates that the sorting should be case-insensitive, meaning that it will treat uppercase and lowercase letters as equal when deciding the order.

2. **Special Cases**:
   - Empty sublists will return an empty list, which is the expected behavior.
   - Lists with mixed case strings (e.g., ["apple", "Banana", "pear"]) will be sorted correctly regardless of their case.
   - Sublists containing numeric strings will also be sorted lexicographically in accordance with Python's default sorting behavior.

3. **Comprehensive Testing**: The function should work for any list of lists containing strings, ensuring that all inputs adhere to the expected structure.

Since there's no case where the function does not meet the described requirements, the correctness of the program is confirmed as true.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a new list of lists where each sublist from 'list_of_lists' is sorted in a case-insensitive manner
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner. The implementation does not handle potential edge cases such as empty sublists, or the input being not a list of lists, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The function assumes that all elements in the sublists are strings and does not account for other data types, which may result in errors during sorting.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
