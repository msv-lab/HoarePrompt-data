Explanation: The code correctly implements a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists in a case-insensitive manner, as specified in the problem description. The output hints indicate that the function does not handle potential edge cases such as empty sublists or input validation but ensures that it will process lists as they are. Since the problem description does not specify that empty sublists should be processed differently, the code's current implementation meets the expectation for valid input provided as per the assumptions stated.

Correctness: **True**.
