The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing strings, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner. The implementation does not handle potential edge cases such as empty sublists, or the input being not a list of lists, which could lead to unexpected behavior. The function assumes that all elements in the sublists are strings and does not account for other data types, which may result in errors during sorting.
