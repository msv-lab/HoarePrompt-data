#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists of strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a new list containing each sublist from 'list_of_lists' sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists of strings, and returns a new list wherein each sublist from `list_of_lists` is sorted in ascending order. If any sublist is empty, the corresponding entry in the returned list will also be an empty list. The function does not modify the original input `list_of_lists` and handles the edge case where `list_of_lists` may contain sublists of varying lengths or empty sublists by returning a correctly sorted structure without raising an error.
