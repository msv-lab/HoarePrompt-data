The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists of strings, and returns a new list wherein each sublist from `list_of_lists` is sorted in ascending order. If any sublist is empty, the corresponding entry in the returned list will also be an empty list. The function does not modify the original input `list_of_lists` and handles the edge case where `list_of_lists` may contain sublists of varying lengths or empty sublists by returning a correctly sorted structure without raising an error.
