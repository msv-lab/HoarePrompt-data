The original assessment states that the program is **False** due to how it handles sorting of strings, specifically regarding leading and trailing spaces. The assessment points out that the expected output considers how spaces affect the sorting results. 

Let's analyze the provided code and assertions against the problem description and output hints:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` sorts each sublist of strings in the input list of lists. The output hints indicate that the function should return a new list where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. This is indeed what the function does by using Python's built-in `sorted()` function.

2. **Handling of Spaces**: The original assessment raises concerns that sorting may not meet common expectations regarding leading and trailing spaces. However, it is important to understand that Python's `sorted()` function performs lexicographical sorting, which is the expected behavior. The output hints also clarify that the function works as specified, returning correctly sorted lists based on this method of sorting.

3. **Expected Outputs**: The output hints lead to a conclusion that the implementation handles various edge cases correctly, such as varying lengths of sublists or empty sublists. The assertion examples provided also confirm that the function maintains the structure and sorts as expected.

4. **Assessment Consistency**: While the original assessment notes that it can produce "unexpected results" based on general expectations (like disregarding whitespace), it does not state that the function is incorrect in terms of fulfilling the problem description. The behavior of including spaces in sorting is indeed part of the lexicographical order and not an issue of correctness under the defined problem requirements.

Given the output hints, the problem description, and the reasoning above, it's clear that the function consistently meets the expectations set out by the problem. 

Therefore, the original assessment appears to misinterpret the expectations of sorting clarity versus actual correctness.

Final: **True**
