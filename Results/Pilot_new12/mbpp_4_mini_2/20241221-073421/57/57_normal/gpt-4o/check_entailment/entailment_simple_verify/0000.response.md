Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program `func_1` fails to handle inputs with leading and trailing whitespace correctly when sorting. The expected output for cases like `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])` is not produced correctly, as the whitespace is not accounted for during sorting. The annotations correctly indicate the state of the program, confirming that it sorts each sublist in ascending order without considering whitespace. Thus, according to the problem description, the program does not meet the requirement, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
