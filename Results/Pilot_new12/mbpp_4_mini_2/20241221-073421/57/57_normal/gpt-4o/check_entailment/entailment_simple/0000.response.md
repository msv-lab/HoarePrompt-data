The program provided implements the intended functionality of sorting each sublist of strings within a list of lists. The assert statements check if the function `func_1` produces the expected sorted output for various test cases.  

Here's the breakdown of the function:

1. **Input**: The input to `func_1` is expected to be a list of lists, which contains strings.
2. **Processing**: The function uses a list comprehension that iterates over each `sublist` in `list_of_lists` and applies the `sorted()` function to it. The `sorted()` function sorts the strings in ascending order.
3. **Output**: The program returns a new list, where each sublist is independently sorted.

Now, let's evaluate the test cases against the expected outputs:

- The first assertion checks if sorting `['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange']` results in `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. However, this expected output is incorrect; the second sublist should be sorted as `['black', 'white']` not `['black', 'white']` which matches. The third sublist should be sorted as `['black', 'orange', 'white']` but the assertion mentions it as `['black', 'orange', 'white']`. Hence, the result of that assertion will fail, making the program incorrect.

- The second assertion checks if sorting `[' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown']` results in `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`. This expected output is also incorrect because the second sublist should produce `[' black', 'blue ']` instead of `[' black', 'blue ']`, thus again failing the assertion.

- The third assertion is also invalid; it checks if sorting `['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze']` results in `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`. The output would be correct because the sorting results are as intended.

Since the program is intended to follow the problem description but the assertions do not hold true for the expected outputs, thereby invalidating the correctness of the program.

Correctness: **False**
