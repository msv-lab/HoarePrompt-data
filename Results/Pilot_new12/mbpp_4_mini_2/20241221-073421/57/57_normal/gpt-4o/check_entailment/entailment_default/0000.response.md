The provided program defines a function `func_1`, which is designed to sort each sublist of strings within a given list of lists. The output hints clarify that the function should handle both varying lengths of sublists and empty sublists correctly.

The implementation of `func_1` uses a list comprehension that applies the built-in `sorted()` function to each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The use of `sorted()` guarantees that the items in each sublist are returned in ascending order. Additionally, if any sublist is empty, `sorted()` will also return an empty list for that sublist, which meets the requirement outlined in the problem description.

By analyzing the assertions provided:
1. The first assertion checks a mixed sublist, and it succeeds in sorting the strings correctly.
2. The second assertion checks for leading/trailing spaces, and it correctly preserves the spaces while sorting the strings.
3. The third assertion ensures sorting for alphanumeric strings, which the program does correctly.

Given that the function correctly processes the examples presented, there are no identified edge cases where the function fails to meet the specifications of the problem description. 

Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct as it fulfills all requirements stated.

Correctness: **True**.
