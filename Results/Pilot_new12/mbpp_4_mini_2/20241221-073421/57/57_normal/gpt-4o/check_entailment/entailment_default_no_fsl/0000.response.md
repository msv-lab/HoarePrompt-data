Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` aims to sort each sublist of strings within a given list of lists. However, upon review, the assertions in the code do not match the expected sorted output for all cases:

1. The assertion:
   ```python
   assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
   ```
   This assertion is incorrect because the expected output `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]` does not match the output of the function which would be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`.

2. The second assertion:
   ```python
   assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
   ```
   This assertion is also misleading because the expected result does not correspond with the sorted values; the function would sort these sublists properly but the expectation seems off.

3. Finally, the third assertion:
   ```python
   assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]
   ```
   This assertion is also incorrect based on expected behavior.

Despite the code base functioning as intended to sort each sublist in ascending order, the provided assertions have discrepancies that stem from incorrect expected results. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirement of yielding correct results for the examples presented in the problem description. 

Since there are clear mismatches in expected outcomes, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect for the criteria specified.
