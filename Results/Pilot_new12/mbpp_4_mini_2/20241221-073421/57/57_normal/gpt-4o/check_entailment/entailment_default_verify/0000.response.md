The program `func_1` is intended to sort each sublist of strings within a given list of lists. The original assessment concluded that the program's correctness is **False**, claiming that it does not correctly handle strings with leading or trailing whitespace. 

Upon analyzing the output hints, it is stated that `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists` and returns a new list where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The hints also specify that the function correctly returns an empty list for any empty sublists and does not modify the original input. 

However, the original assessment points out that the example input `([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])` is handled incorrectly as the expected output does not match what is provided: `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]` vs. what `func_1` would produce, which is `[[' green', ' red '], [' blue ', 'black'], [' brown', ' orange']]`. 

This inconsistency indicates that the program fails at key scenarios relating to whitespace handling which could lead to unexpected output and therefore does not meet the problem description accurately.

Based on this analysis and the original assessment reasoning, the conclusion is as follows:

Final: **False**
