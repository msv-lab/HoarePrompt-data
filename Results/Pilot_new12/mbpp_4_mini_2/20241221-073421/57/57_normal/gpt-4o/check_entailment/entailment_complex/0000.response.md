Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not produce the expected output according to the problem description. Specifically, the assertions in the annotations do not match the expected sorting behavior for the strings in the sublists. 

1. The assertion `func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange']))` is expected to yield `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, but when sorted, the correct output should be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. 
   - The issue arises because the sorting is not done based on strict alphabetical order, potentially leading to incorrect arrangements in the sublists.
   
2. The assertion `func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown']))` is expected to yield `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`, but sorting should lead to `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`, which is also not aligned with how whitespace should be handled in typical string sorting in Python (which might lead to unexpected behavior).

3. Finally, the assertion `func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze']))` is expected to yield output that reflects an incorrect order according to the standard string sorting in Python, further illustrating the program's faults.

Overall, the program does not adhere to the common sorting functionality of strings in Python, especially with regard to whitespace and expected order, resulting in incorrect outputs for the given test cases. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem's requirements consistently.
