Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately identifies that the program correctly implements the computation of the n-th Lucas number based on its defined properties. The annotations confirm that the base cases are correctly handled and that the iterative process generates the Fibonacci-like sequence correctly. All assertions validate the function's outputs for the specified inputs, demonstrating that the function performs as intended according to the problem description. Thus, based on the evidence from both the assessment and the annotations, the final conclusion is that the program is correct.
