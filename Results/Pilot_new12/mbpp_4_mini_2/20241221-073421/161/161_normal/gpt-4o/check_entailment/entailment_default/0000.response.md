The provided code implements a function to calculate the n-th Lucas number, which is a sequence where the first two numbers are defined as follows: L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding ones. 

The program includes the following logic:
- If n is 0, it returns 2.
- If n is 1, it returns 1.
- For all other values of n (n â‰¥ 2), it calculates the value iteratively by maintaining two variables representing the last two Lucas numbers.

The output hints affirm that the function returns the correct Lucas number according to the described properties: L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) with the base cases provided.

The assertions in the program:
- `assert func_1(9) == 76`: The 9th Lucas number is indeed 76.
- `assert func_1(4) == 7`: The 4th Lucas number is indeed 7.
- `assert func_1(3) == 4`: The 3rd Lucas number is indeed 4.

All examples align with the Lucas sequence definitions: 2, 1, 3, 4, 7, 11, 18, 29, 47, 76...

Since the code correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for the specified valid input cases (non-negative integers) and adheres to the output hints, it works properly according to the problem description for all potential cases as per our assumptions.

Correctness: **True**.
