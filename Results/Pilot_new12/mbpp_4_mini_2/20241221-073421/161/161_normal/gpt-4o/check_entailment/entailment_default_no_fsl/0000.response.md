Correctness: **False**

The program does not compute the Lucas numbers correctly for n ≥ 2. In the Lucas number sequence, the first few terms are defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(2) = 3
- L(3) = 4
- L(4) = 7
- L(5) = 11
- L(6) = 18
- L(7) = 29
- L(8) = 47
- L(9) = 76

The provided function implements a Fibonacci-like sequence starting with initial values (2, 1) and miscalculates values for n ≥ 2 by using an incorrect sum in its iterative loop. Specifically, instead of `b = a + b`, it should actually be `b = a + b` after swapping (which it does correctly, but the definition of which number is `a` and `b` is incorrect).

For example, the function calculates `func_1(2)` as 4 instead of the correct Lucas number 3. Thus, the output hints provided are misleading because they don't correctly describe the function's output for the defined cases for Lucas numbers.

Since there are specific input cases (like `func_1(2)`) where the program does not function as intended, the overall correctness is **False**.
