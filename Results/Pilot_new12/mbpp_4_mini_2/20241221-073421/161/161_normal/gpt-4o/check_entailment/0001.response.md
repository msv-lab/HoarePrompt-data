To determine the correctness of the provided Python program which is intended to find the n'th Lucas number, I will examine the problem description closely in conjunction with the provided code.

The Lucas numbers are defined similarly to the Fibonacci numbers, with precedence given to:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2

Now, let's analyze the given function, `func_1(n)`:

1. The base cases are properly defined:
   - For `n == 0`, the function returns `2`.
   - For `n == 1`, the function returns `1`.

2. For `n >= 2`, the function enters a loop to compute the Lucas numbers. It initializes two variables `a` and `b` to the values of the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1, respectively). It then updates these values iteratively.

3. The update procedure `(a, b) = (b, a + b)` accurately reflects the relationship defining the Lucas numbers.

Next, I will carefully check the assertions:

- `assert func_1(9) == 76` 
- `assert func_1(4) == 7` 
- `assert func_1(3) == 4` 

Now, we will evaluate what `func_1(n)` returns for these values of `n`:

- For `n = 3`:
  - L(0) = 2
  - L(1) = 1
  - L(2) = L(0) + L(1) = 2 + 1 = 3
  - L(3) = L(1) + L(2) = 1 + 3 = 4 (This matches `assert func_1(3) == 4`)

- For `n = 4`:
  - L(4) = L(2) + L(3) = 3 + 4 = 7 (This matches `assert func_1(4) == 7`)

- For `n = 9`:
  - Calculating further:
    - L(5) = L(3) + L(4) = 4 + 7 = 11
    - L(6) = L(4) + L(5) = 7 + 11 = 18
    - L(7) = L(5) + L(6) = 11 + 18 = 29
    - L(8) = L(6) + L(7) = 18 + 29 = 47
    - L(9) = L(7) + L(8) = 29 + 47 = 76 (This matches `assert func_1(9) == 76`)

Since all tests pass, the function correctly computes the n'th Lucas number for the given input.

Therefore, after examining the implementation and checking against the problem description and possible edge cases, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**

The function correctly calculates the n'th Lucas number based on both the base cases and the recursive relationship defined for Lucas numbers.
