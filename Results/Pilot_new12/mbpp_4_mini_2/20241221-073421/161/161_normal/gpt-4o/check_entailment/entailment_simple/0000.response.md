To determine the correctness of the provided program in relation to the problem description, we need to examine what the program is attempting to achieve and how it handles the Lucas numbers.

### Problem Description:
The function is required to compute the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence starts with:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2

### Analysis of the Program:
The program has an implementation of the function `func_1` which is expected to calculate the n-th Lucas number based on the following logic:
1. If `n` is 0, it returns 2 (correct).
2. If `n` is 1, it returns 1 (correct).
3. For `n >= 2`, it uses a loop to generate subsequent numbers, initializing `a` to 2 (L(0)) and `b` to 1 (L(1)), then iteratively calculating the next Lucas numbers.

The implementation correctly computes subsequent Lucas numbers as:
- a represents L(n-1)
- b represents L(n)

The loop continues this until it computes L(n).

### Assertions:
The program also has assertions:
- `func_1(9) == 76`: This is correct because L(9) = 76
- `func_1(4) == 7`: This is correct since L(4) = 7
- `func_1(3) == 4`: This is accurate as L(3) = 4

### Conclusion:
Since the function behaves correctly according to the Lucas number definition given in the problem description for all cases analyzed, we can confirm the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Thus, the correctness of the program is as follows:

Correctness: **True**
