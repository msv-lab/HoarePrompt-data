Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to find the n-th Lucas number. However, upon careful examination, it incorrectly describes its behavior through comments. Specifically, it refers to the values of the Lucas sequence but uses the Fibonacci-like logic, which might confuse it with the Fibonacci sequence.

1. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
   - L(0) = 2
   - L(1) = 1
   - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n â‰¥ 2

2. In the `func_1` function:
   - It returns `2` when `n` is `0`, which is correct (L(0) = 2).
   - It returns `1` when `n` is `1`, which is also correct (L(1) = 1).
   - For values of `n` greater than or equal to `2`, it efficiently computes the following terms in the manner of the Fibonacci sequence, which is correct for the structure of the sequence, as the Lucas numbers can be calculated using a similar additive approach.

3. However, the program's comments state that it is calculating a Fibonacci-like sequence and calls the variables involved "Fibonacci-like". This is misleading because it implies that the sequence being calculated is the Fibonacci numbers instead of explicitly stating that the relation is rooted in the Lucas sequence. 

4. The test assertions:
   - It asserts `func_1(9) == 76`, which is the correct value for L(9), and similar statements for L(4) and L(3).
   - Because these assertions pass, the outputs align with the expected Lucas numbers.

The program logically calculates the n-th Lucas number correctly, but the use of the term "Fibonacci-like" in the comments is misleading and incorrect in the context of the problem description. Therefore, while it computes the correct values, the error in terminology signifies that it does not fully comply with the problem requirements as stated. This discrepancy invalidates the overall correctness assessment based on clarity and correctness of terminology.

Thus, the conclusion is that the program does not accurately reflect that it is specifically calculating the Lucas numbers based on its comments and naming.
