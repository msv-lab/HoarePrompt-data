Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function computes the n-th Lucas number in accordance with the problem description. The annotations confirm the behavior of the function at different points, explaining that the function handles base cases as expected and correctly computes the value for n â‰¥ 2 using an iterative approach. The assertions test specific cases of the Lucas sequence, and the values returned (76, 7, and 4) match the expected results outlined in the problem statement. Given that the program assumes valid non-negative integers for input, the absence of checks for negative values does not compromise its correctness. Therefore, the program is indeed correct as per the stated requirements and the analysis presented.
