Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate as the program correctly computes the n-th Lucas number according to the problem description. The function handles the base cases appropriately and efficiently computes the value for n â‰¥ 2 using a simple iterative approach. The output hints confirm that the function's behavior aligns with the expected results for the Lucas sequence. Therefore, there is no evidence from the output hints to suggest any shortcomings in the program, and all test cases included corroborate its correctness.
