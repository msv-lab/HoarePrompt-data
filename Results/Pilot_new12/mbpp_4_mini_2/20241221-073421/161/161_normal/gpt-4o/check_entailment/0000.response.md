Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly computes the n-th Lucas number as described in the problem statement. The Lucas sequence starts with L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, with subsequent numbers being the sum of the two preceding ones. The implementation verifies the base cases (0 and 1), and for n >= 2, it accurately computes the sequence iteratively. The assertions provided confirm that the function returns the expected results for the test cases tested. There appears to be no error for the values of n tested (0, 1, 3, 4, 9), and the logic holds for other potential inputs as well, given the nature of the Lucas sequence.

Thus, the program is correct across the input range specified.
