Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` accurately computes the n-th Lucas number following the defined base cases and recursive relationship. It correctly handles the cases for n = 0, 1 and computes values for n â‰¥ 2 using an iterative approach. The output hints confirm that the function is designed to accept a non-negative integer and follows the required behavior without needing to handle negative inputs, aligning with the problem description. Thus, the function's correctness remains validated by all provided information.
