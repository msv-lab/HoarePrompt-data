You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns the constant value 2.
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci-like number, `b` is the nth Fibonacci-like number with base cases a_1=2, b_1=1 for n ≥ 2.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth Fibonacci-like number 'b', where base cases are a_1=2, b_1=1 for n ≥ 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and behaves as follows: it returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and for `n ≥ 2`, it calculates and returns the `n`-th term of a Fibonacci-like sequence where the base cases are defined as `a_1=2` and `b_1=1`. The sequence follows the rule that each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The function efficiently computes the result using iterative calculations. There are no checks for negative values of `n`, but since the problem states `n` is a non-negative integer, that case does not need to be covered.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
