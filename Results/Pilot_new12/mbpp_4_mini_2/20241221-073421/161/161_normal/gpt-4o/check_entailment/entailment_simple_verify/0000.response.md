Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly computes the n-th Lucas number according to the problem description. The Lucas sequence begins with the values 2 and 1 for L(0) and L(1) respectively, and the implementation adheres to these base cases. The function handles non-negative integer inputs correctly, returning the appropriate values for L(0) and L(1) directly, and for n >= 2, it iteratively calculates the subsequent Lucas numbers. 

The annotations confirm that the state of the program before returning values is in line with how the Lucas numbers are defined, ensuring that within the loop, `a` and `b` properly represent the (n-1)th and nth Lucas numbers. The test assertions supplied further validate the correctness of the function for the specified inputs.

Thus, the program is correct across the specified input range, supporting the original conclusion of correctness.
