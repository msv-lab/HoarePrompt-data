You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly computes the n-th Lucas number as described in the problem statement. The Lucas sequence starts with L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, with subsequent numbers being the sum of the two preceding ones. The implementation verifies the base cases (0 and 1), and for n >= 2, it accurately computes the sequence iteratively. The assertions provided confirm that the function returns the expected results for the test cases tested. There appears to be no error for the values of n tested (0, 1, 3, 4, 9), and the logic holds for other potential inputs as well, given the nature of the Lucas sequence.

Thus, the program is correct across the input range specified.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns the constant value 2.
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci-like number, `b` is the nth Fibonacci-like number with base cases a_1=2, b_1=1 for n ≥ 2.
            return b
            #The program returns the nth Fibonacci-like number 'b', where base cases are a_1=2, b_1=1 for n ≥ 2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and behaves as follows: it returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and for `n ≥ 2`, it calculates and returns the `n`-th term of a Fibonacci-like sequence where the base cases are defined as `a_1=2` and `b_1=1`. The sequence follows the rule that each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The function efficiently computes the result using iterative calculations. There are no checks for negative values of `n`, but since the problem states `n` is a non-negative integer, that case does not need to be covered.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
