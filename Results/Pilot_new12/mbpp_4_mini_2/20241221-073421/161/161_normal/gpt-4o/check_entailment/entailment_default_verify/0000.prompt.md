You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(9) == 76
assert func_1(4) == 7
assert func_1(3) == 4

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly computes the n-th Lucas number as described in the problem statement. The Lucas sequence starts with L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, with subsequent numbers being the sum of the two preceding ones. The implementation verifies the base cases (0 and 1), and for n >= 2, it accurately computes the sequence iteratively. The assertions provided confirm that the function returns the expected results for the test cases tested. There appears to be no error for the values of n tested (0, 1, 3, 4, 9), and the logic holds for other potential inputs as well, given the nature of the Lucas sequence.

Thus, the program is correct across the input range specified.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and behaves as follows: it returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and for `n â‰¥ 2`, it calculates and returns the `n`-th term of a Fibonacci-like sequence where the base cases are defined as `a_1=2` and `b_1=1`. The sequence follows the rule that each subsequent number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The function efficiently computes the result using iterative calculations. There are no checks for negative values of `n`, but since the problem states `n` is a non-negative integer, that case does not need to be covered.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
