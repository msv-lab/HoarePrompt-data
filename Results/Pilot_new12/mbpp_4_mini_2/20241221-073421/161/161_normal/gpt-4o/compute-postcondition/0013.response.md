To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's first consider the code provided and its implications based on the initial state.

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1.

### Loop Analysis
The loop iterates from 2 to `n`, inclusive, meaning it will execute `n - 1` times. During each iteration:
- The value of `a` is updated to the previous value of `b`.
- The value of `b` is updated to the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`.

We have the following transformations during each step:
1. **1st iteration (_ = 2)**: 
   - Previous `a` is 2, `b` is 1.
   - After the update: `a` becomes 1, `b` becomes 3.
  
2. **2nd iteration (_ = 3)**:
   - Previous `a` is 1, `b` is 3.
   - After the update: `a` becomes 3, `b` becomes 4.

3. **3rd iteration (_ = 4)**:
   - Previous `a` is 3, `b` is 4.
   - After the update: `a` becomes 4, `b` becomes 7.

### Output State Calculation
After all iterations, the final values of `a` and `b` can be determined by recognizing that:
- If `n` is `k`, the loop iterates from `2` to `k`, resulting in `k-1` iterations.
- The new values of `a` and `b` depend recursively on their previous values.

Conclusively, after the last iteration:
- When `n` is 2, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3.
- When `n` is 3, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4.
- When `n` is 4, `a` is 4 and `b` is 7.

Let’s summarize all updates and establish the final output state:
- For the last execution of the loop `n = k`, after `k - 1` iterations:
- The value of `a` depends on previous `b`, and `b` accumulates the Fibonacci-like sequence described.

Output State: **`a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci-like number, `b` is the nth Fibonacci-like number with base cases a_1=2, b_1=1 for n ≥ 2.**
