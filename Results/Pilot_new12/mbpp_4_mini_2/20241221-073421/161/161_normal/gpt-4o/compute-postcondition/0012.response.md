The code snippet `a, b = b, a + b` is a simultaneous assignment where the new value for `a` is set to the old value of `b`, and the new value for `b` is set to the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` is 4
- `b` is 3

Step by step, we calculate the new values:
1. The new value for `a` becomes `b`, which is 3.
2. The new value for `b` becomes `a + b`, which is `4 + 3 = 7`.

Now we update the values accordingly while keeping the initial conditions valid:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 (remains unchanged)
- `a` becomes 3
- `b` becomes 7
- `_` remains 4 (unchanged)

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 7, `_` is 4**.
