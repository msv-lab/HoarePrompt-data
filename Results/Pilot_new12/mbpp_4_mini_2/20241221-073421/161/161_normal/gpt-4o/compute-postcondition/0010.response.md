The operation swaps the values of `a` and `b`, with `b` being assigned the previous value of `b` and `a` being assigned the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`. 

Given the initial values:
- `a` is 1
- `b` is 3

After the execution:
- The new value of `a` will be `a + b`, which is `1 + 3 = 4`.
- The new value of `b` will be the previous value of `b`, which is `3`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
`n` is greater than 2; `a` is 4; `b` is 3; `_` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2; `a` is 4; `b` is 3; `_` is 3.**
