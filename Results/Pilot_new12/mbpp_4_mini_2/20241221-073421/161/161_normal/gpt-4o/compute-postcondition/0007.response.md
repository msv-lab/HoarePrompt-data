According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. The loop runs from 2 to `n + 1`, which means it will execute at least once if `n` is 2 or greater. Given that the state indicates `n` is a non-negative integer, greater than 0, and not equal to 1, it indicates that `n` could be 2 or more, which allows the loop to execute.

The loop will start with `_` as the loop variable initialized to 2, and the loop's last iteration would be when `_` equals `n`. 

Specifically:
- If `n` is 2, it will iterate once with `_` equal to 2.
- If `n` is greater than 2, it will iterate from 2 up to `n`.

For the loop to execute correctly:
- The variable `_` must start at 2.
- The value of `n` must ensure that the loop can iterate.

Hence, the state remains consistent. 

State: **`n` is greater than 1, and at least 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `_` is 2**
