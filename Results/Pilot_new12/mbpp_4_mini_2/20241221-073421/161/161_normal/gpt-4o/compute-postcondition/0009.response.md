According to the code, whether the loop can execute one more time depends on the variable `n`. The loop iterates from 2 to `n + 1`, which means it will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 2. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1 and at least 2, `_` is currently 2. 

For the next iteration, `_` will increase by 1. Since `_` starts at 2, it will become 3 for the next iteration. The loop can still execute if `3` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, which will always be true as `n` is at least 2. 

Thus, to execute one more time, `_` needs to be 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 2; `a` is 1; `b` is 3; `_` is 3**
