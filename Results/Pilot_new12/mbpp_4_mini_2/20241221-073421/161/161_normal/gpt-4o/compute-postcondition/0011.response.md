According to the code, the loop executes for a range starting from 2 up to and including `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 4, since the loop will execute for `_ = 2`, `_ = 3`, and then the next increment will be for `_ = 4`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 3, which means the loop has executed with `_` as 2 and then 3. Given that `n` is greater than 2, to allow for another iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `_` should be incremented to 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 3, `_` is 4**
