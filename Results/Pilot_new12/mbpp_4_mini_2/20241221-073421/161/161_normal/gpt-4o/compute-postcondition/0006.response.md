The initial state establishes that `n` is a non-negative integer, greater than 0, and not equal to 1. The code snippet assigns values to the variables `a` and `b`. 

In this case:
- `a` is assigned the value `2`.
- `b` is assigned the value `1`.

Since the only changes are to `a` and `b`, the values of `n`, which remain unchanged, will be retained in the output state. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, and `n` is not equal to 1; `a` is 2; `b` is 1**.
