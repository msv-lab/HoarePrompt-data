The variables `a` and `b` are being assigned new values with the expression `a, b = b, a + b`. This means that `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`. 

Initially, we have:
- `a = 2`
- `b = 1`

- After executing `a, b = b, a + b`:
  - `a` will be assigned the current value of `b`, which is `1`.
  - `b` will be assigned the value of `a + b`, which is `2 + 1`, resulting in `3`.

Thus, the updated values are:
- `a` is now `1`
- `b` is now `3`

The values of `n` and `_` remain unchanged, and the conditions for `n` being greater than 1 and at least 2, as well as `_` being `2`, are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1 and at least 2; `a` is 1; `b` is 3; `_` is 2**
