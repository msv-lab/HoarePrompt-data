#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns the integer 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `a` is equal to the (n-1)th Fibonacci number + the (n-2)th Fibonacci number, `b` is equal to the nth Fibonacci number.
            return b
            #The program returns b, which is equal to the nth Fibonacci number for a non-negative integer n greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as a parameter. It returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and for any other non-negative integer `n` greater than 1, it returns the nth Fibonacci number. Thus, the function correctly handles the edge cases for `n` being 0 and 1, while also computing Fibonacci numbers for larger values of `n`. There are no missing functionalities, and it is important to note that the function assumes the input is always a non-negative integer, as indicated by the annotations.
