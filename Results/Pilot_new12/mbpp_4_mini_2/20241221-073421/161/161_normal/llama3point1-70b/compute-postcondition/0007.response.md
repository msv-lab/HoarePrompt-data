According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 2 to `n + 1`, inclusive. Given that `n` is greater than 0, with the specific constraints that `n` is not equal to 1, this means that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration of the loop, the value used in the loop execution doesn't directly affect the loop since `_` is a throwaway variable. 

In terms of state adjustments, as `n` is greater than 0 and not 1, it implies that `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute. The loop will then start iterating from 2. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, loop variable `_` starts from 2**.
