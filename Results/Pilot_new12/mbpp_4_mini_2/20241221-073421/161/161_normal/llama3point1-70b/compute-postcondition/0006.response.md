The values of `a` and `b` are assigned to 2 and 1, respectively. The previous values of `n` are not affected by this assignment. The output state will reflect the new values of `a` and `b`, while retaining the valid preconditions of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `n` is greater than 0, `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
