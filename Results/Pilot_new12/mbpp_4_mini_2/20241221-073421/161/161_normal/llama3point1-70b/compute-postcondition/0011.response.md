According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `_` (which acts as the loop variable) is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `_` is currently at 3, and for one more iteration, it will increment `_` by 1.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` will be increased to 4. For this new value of `_` to be valid in the loop, `n` must be at least 4, as the range for `_` goes from 2 to `n + 1`. 

Thus, the updated state should reflect these changes. 

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 4**
