In the given code, `a` and `b` are assigned new values based on their previous state. The variable `a` takes the previous value of `b`, which is `1`, and `b` is updated to the sum of the previous values of `a` and `b`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.

Now let's summarize:

- The previous value of `a` was `2`.
- The previous value of `b` was `1`.
- After execution, `a` becomes `1`, and `b` becomes `3`.

The states of all other variables, including `n`, remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is not equal to 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, loop variable `_` starts from 2**.
