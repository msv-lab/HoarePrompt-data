According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `n`. The loop can iterate as long as `_` takes on values starting from 2 up to `n + 1`. The loop variable `_` will be increased by 1 with each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and since `n` is not equal to 1, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3. Therefore, in the next iteration, `_` will be 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3, `_` is 3**
