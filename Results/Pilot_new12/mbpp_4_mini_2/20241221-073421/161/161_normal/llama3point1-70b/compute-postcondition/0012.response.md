`a` and `b` are reassigned their values: `a` takes the previous value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`. The previous values are `a = 3` and `b = 4`. After assignment, `a` becomes `4` and `b` becomes `3 + 4`, which is `7`.

Thus, the updated values are:
- `a` is now `4`
- `b` is now `7`

The condition `n must be greater than or equal to 4` remains valid after execution.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `a` is 4, `b` is 7, `_` is 4**
