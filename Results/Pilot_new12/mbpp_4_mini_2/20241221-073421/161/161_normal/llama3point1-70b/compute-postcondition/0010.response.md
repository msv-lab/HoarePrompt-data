The code snippet `a, b = b, a + b` assigns new values to `a` and `b`. In the right-hand side of the assignment, `b` retains its current value, which is 3, while `a + b` computes the sum of the current values of `a` (which is 1) and `b` (which is 3), resulting in 4. Therefore, after the execution, `a` will be assigned the value 3, and `b` will be assigned the value 4.

The initial precondition states remain valid, but the values for `a` and `b` are updated.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4, `_` is 3**
