To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop based on the provided initial state and loop behavior, we analyze how the loop affects the variables `a` and `b`.

The loop starts from `2` and runs up to `n`, iterating `n - 1` times. In each iteration:

- The variable `a` takes the old value of `b`.
- The variable `b` is updated to be the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`.

Initially, `a` is `2` and `b` is `1`. 

Through the iterations, we can derive the relationship of `a` and `b` through the Fibonacci-like sequence, adjusting for the starting values of `a` and `b`:

1. After the 1st iteration (`_`=2):
   - `a` (old `b`) → `1`
   - `b` (old `a + old b`) → `2 + 1 = 3`
   
2. After the 2nd iteration (`_`=3):
   - `a` → `3` (old `b`)
   - `b` → `1 + 3 = 4`
   
3. After the 3rd iteration (`_`=4):
   - `a` → `4` (old `b`)
   - `b` → `3 + 4 = 7`

We continue this pattern. The formula that can be established is:
- The value of `b` after `k` iterations relates to the Fibonacci numbers, starting from an adjusted base case.

Ultimately, to compute the final state after all iterations of the loop when it runs `n - 1` times, we need to keep in mind that `a` and `b` will represent two specific values in the Fibonacci-like sequence:

After `n - 1` iterations:
- `a` will be `F(n - 1) + F(n - 2)`, where `F` represents Fibonacci numbers, and `b` will be `F(n)` based on initial conditions.

Thus, the output state taking into consideration all the necessary relationships and the fact that the loop must run from `2` up to `n` is:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `a` is equal to the (n-1)th Fibonacci number + the (n-2)th Fibonacci number, `b` is equal to the nth Fibonacci number.**
