The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as a parameter. It returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and for any other non-negative integer `n` greater than 1, it returns the nth Fibonacci number. Thus, the function correctly handles the edge cases for `n` being 0 and 1, while also computing Fibonacci numbers for larger values of `n`. There are no missing functionalities, and it is important to note that the function assumes the input is always a non-negative integer, as indicated by the annotations.
