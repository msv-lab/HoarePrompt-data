Explanation: The function `func_1` is supposed to compute the nth Lucas number, which starts with the base cases L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1, and follows the recurrence relation L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1. However, the function provided does not compute the Lucas numbers correctly for values of n >= 2. Instead, it computes Fibonacci numbers due to the incorrect assignment within the loop, using the initialization values of (a, b) that correspond to the Fibonacci sequence. According to the output hints, it suggests that the function returns Fibonacci numbers for n greater than 1, which is incorrect with respect to the problem description. 

For example, if we call `func_1(2)`, it should return L(2) = L(1) + L(0) = 1 + 2 = 3 as per the Lucas series, but it will return 3 (Fibonacci result) instead of 3 for Lucas. Other cases beyond n: n = 2 will also yield Fibonacci results in place of the expected Lucas numbers.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, namely when n >= 2.

Correctness: **False**.
