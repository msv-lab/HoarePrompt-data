Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to compute the n-th Lucas number as described in the problem. The Lucas numbers are a specific sequence defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

While the program correctly returns L(0) and L(1), it erroneously includes comments about the Fibonacci sequence instead of the Lucas sequence. This is misleading and demonstrates an incorrect understanding of the values being computed. 

Specifically, the variable `b` in the loop is described as representing the n-th Fibonacci number when it should be returning the n-th Lucas number. 

Thus, the program implementation does not meet the requirements to find the n-th Lucas number and instead falsely references the Fibonacci sequence. This inconsistency with the problem description leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
