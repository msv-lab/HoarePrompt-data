Correctness: **True**.

The provided function correctly implements the logic to calculate the nth Lucas number according to the well-defined sequence of Lucas numbers. 

1. For `n = 0`, it correctly returns 2, which is the first Lucas number.
2. For `n = 1`, it correctly returns 1, which is the second Lucas number.
3. For all `n >= 2`, it correctly uses an iterative approach to compute the Lucas numbers based on the recurrence relation: L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2), which aligns with the definition of Lucas numbers (the sequence starts with 2 and 1).

The iterative loop correctly updates the values of `a` and `b`, which represent the last two computed Lucas numbers, ensuring that it handles all non-negative integer inputs as expected for the nth Lucas number. No edge cases seem to be overlooked, and thus the function behaves correctly for all possible inputs as specified in the problem description.
