The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to calculate the nth Lucas number. The assessment points out that for the edge cases of `n = 0` and `n = 1`, the function returns the appropriate results. It also highlights that the function uses an iterative approach to compute the Lucas numbers based on the recurrence relation correctly. 

However, the output hints indicate that for values of `n` greater than 1, the function returns the nth Fibonacci number instead of the nth Lucas number. The output hints explicitly state that the function, while handling edge cases properly for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, defaults to Fibonacci numbers for higher `n`. This contradicts the original assessment of correctness since the requirement was to compute Lucas numbers.

Given this contradiction, the original assessment is not accurate. The program fails to meet the problem description since it does not compute the Lucas numbers for any `n > 1`. 

Thus, taking these points into consideration, the final assessment of the program's correctness is as follows:

Final: **False**
