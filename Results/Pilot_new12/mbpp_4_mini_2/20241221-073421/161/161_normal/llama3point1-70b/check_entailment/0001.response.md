Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the n-th Lucas number based on the problem description. The Lucas numbers are a sequence defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The function `func_1` implements this definition using an iterative approach. 

### Explanation:
1. It correctly returns `2` for `n = 0`, which is the base case for the Lucas numbers.
2. It returns `1` for `n = 1`, which is the second base case.
3. For all `n > 1`, it calculates the Lucas number by iterating from `2` to `n`, updating the values of `a` and `b` to reflect the two previous values in the sequence and ensuring that the result is accurate according to the Lucas number formula.

No edge cases or potential issues were identified in the program. All cases for non-negative integers are correctly handled, making the implementation valid. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct, and hence the output is True.
