You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the n-th Lucas number based on the problem description. The Lucas numbers are a sequence defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

The function `func_1` implements this definition using an iterative approach. 

### Explanation:
1. It correctly returns `2` for `n = 0`, which is the base case for the Lucas numbers.
2. It returns `1` for `n = 1`, which is the second base case.
3. For all `n > 1`, it calculates the Lucas number by iterating from `2` to `n`, updating the values of `a` and `b` to reflect the two previous values in the sequence and ensuring that the result is accurate according to the Lucas number formula.

No edge cases or potential issues were identified in the program. All cases for non-negative integers are correctly handled, making the implementation valid. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct, and hence the output is True.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` as a parameter. It returns 2 if `n` is 0, returns 1 if `n` is 1, and for any other non-negative integer `n` greater than 1, it returns the nth Fibonacci number. Thus, the function correctly handles the edge cases for `n` being 0 and 1, while also computing Fibonacci numbers for larger values of `n`. There are no missing functionalities, and it is important to note that the function assumes the input is always a non-negative integer, as indicated by the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
