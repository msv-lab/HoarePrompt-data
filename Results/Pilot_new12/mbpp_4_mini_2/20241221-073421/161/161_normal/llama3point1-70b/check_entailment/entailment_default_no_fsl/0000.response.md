Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` does not meet the requirements of the problem description, which asks for the computation of the nth Lucas number. Instead, the code incorrectly computes the nth Fibonacci number for values of `n` greater than 1. For example, for `n = 2`, the correct Lucas number is 3, but the function returns 2, which is the Fibonacci number for `n = 2`. Therefore, the program fails to implement the correct logic for computing Lucas numbers beyond the base cases. This demonstrates that the function is incorrect for at least some potential inputs, which results in the correctness evaluation as false.
