The original assessment concludes that the program correctly calculates the n-th Lucas number based on the problem description, and the annotations seem to support this judgment initially. However, there is a critical issue in the annotations that leads to confusion regarding the nature of the calculations performed by the function.

The program is stated to return the n-th Lucas number, which follows the recurrence:
- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

In the annotated version, after the `for` loop, it states that `b` is equal to the n-th Fibonacci number. This is incorrect because the program is supposed to compute the n-th Lucas number, not the Fibonacci number. Therefore, the annotation is not only misleading but wrong.

Given that the program computes the Fibonacci numbers instead of the intended Lucas numbers, the final conclusion must reflect this discrepancy with the problem description.

Final: **False**
