Correctness: **False**

The provided annotated program does not fulfill the problem description requirements. The problem specifically asks for a function to find the n-th **Lucas number**, but the implementation of `func_1` is computing the n-th **Fibonacci number** instead. 

The Lucas numbers are defined as:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1

In contrast, the Fibonacci numbers are defined as:

- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n â‰¥ 2

The function correctly handles the cases for `n` being 0 and 1 by returning 2 and 1, respectively. However, for `n > 1`, the function incorrectly computes Fibonacci numbers, not Lucas numbers, since it initializes `a` to 2 (L(0), which is correct) and `b` to 1 (L(1), which is correct), but thereafter runs a loop calculating the Fibonacci numbers instead of the Lucas numbers.

This discrepancy means that the function does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description, hence the final return value should be **False**.
