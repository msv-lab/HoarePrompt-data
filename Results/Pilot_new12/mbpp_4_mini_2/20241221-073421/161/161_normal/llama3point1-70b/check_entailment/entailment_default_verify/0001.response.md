Final: **False**

The original assessment is not accurate. The program `func_1` correctly calculates the base cases for the Lucas sequence (where L(0) = 2 and L(1) = 1). However, for values of `n > 1`, the output hints indicate that the program returns the nth Fibonacci number instead of the nth Lucas number. This discrepancy means that the implementation does not meet the problem description, which specifically calls for the calculation of Lucas numbers for all non-negative integers. 

Therefore, since the function does not correctly compute the n-th Lucas number for `n > 1`, the conclusion is that the program is incorrect.
