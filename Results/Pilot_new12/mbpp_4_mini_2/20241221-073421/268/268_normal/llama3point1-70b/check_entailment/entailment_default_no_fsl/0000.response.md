Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is 0. According to the output hints, if `n` is 0, the function will attempt to access the (n-1)th element, which translates to accessing the -1 index of a row. This will raise an `IndexError`, as negative indexing does not align with the problem's requirement of returning the maximum of the nth column correctly. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirement for every potential case, particularly when `n` is 0.
