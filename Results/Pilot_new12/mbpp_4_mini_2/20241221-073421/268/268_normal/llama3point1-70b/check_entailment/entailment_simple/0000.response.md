Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the program is intended to find the maximum value of the n-th column in the provided matrix. However, the provided code incorrectly uses `n - 1` when trying to access elements of each row (`row[n - 1]`), which essentially shifts the index to the left by one. 

For example, if n is 1 (the first column), the program tries to access the 0th index, which is correct, but if n is 2 (the second column), the program attempts to access the 1st index instead of the 2nd index (index 1, corresponding to the second column in a zero-indexed list). Hence, the implementation will always return the max value of the (n-1)th column rather than the nth column as required by the problem description. 

To fix the issue, the program should simply access `row[n]` instead of `row[n - 1]` to meet the requirement of finding the maximum value in the nth column. Therefore, it fails to fulfill the task outlined in the problem description.
