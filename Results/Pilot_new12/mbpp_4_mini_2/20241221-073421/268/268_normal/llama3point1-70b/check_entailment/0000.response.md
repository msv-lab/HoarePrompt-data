Correctness: **False**.

The program does not properly handle the case where the column index `n` is out of bounds for the provided matrix. For instance, if `matrix` is a list of lists with fewer than `n` columns or if `n` is less than 1, it would raise an `IndexError`. 

Here's an example case:
```python
matrix = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
n = 3  # There is no third column in the matrix
```
In this case, calling `func_1(matrix, n)` would result in an error, demonstrating that the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
