Final: **False** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not handle cases of an empty matrix, invalid column index `n`, and non-numeric values, which are significant issues given the problem description. Despite the output hints suggesting that the inputs would be valid, the logic in the program would lead to errors in certain circumstances (specifically when `n` is 0 or when the input matrix is empty). Thus, the assertions in the original assessment remain accurate and the program cannot be considered correct as it does not sufficiently cover all edge cases outlined in the problem description.
