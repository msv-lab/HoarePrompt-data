To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to look closely at how it operates with different inputs and whether it adheres to the problem description: "Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column."

Examining the program:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max((row[n - 1] for row in matrix))
```

### Analysis

1. The function takes two arguments: `matrix`, which is expected to be a list of lists, and `n`, representing the column index for which we need to find the maximum value.

2. The function accesses the (n-1)th index for each row in the matrix. This implies:
   - `n` is expected to start from 1 for a 1-based index (as per common usage), hence it correctly accesses the 0-based index in Python.
   
3. The function uses a generator expression to iterate through each row and retrieve the value from the n-th column before passing it to the `max` function.

### Potential Issues

- **Empty Matrix**: If the input `matrix` is empty (i.e., `[]`), the function will raise a `ValueError` when trying to compute the maximum of an empty sequence.

- **Invalid Column Index**: If `n` is not a valid column index (for example, if `n` is less than 1 or exceeds the number of columns in the matrix), then attempting to access `row[n - 1]` will raise an `IndexError`.

- **Non-numeric Values**: The matrix could contain non-numeric values in the specified column, which would lead to a `TypeError` when `max` is trying to compare values of different types.

### Conclusion

Based on the issues highlighted:

1. The program does not handle the case when `matrix` is empty.
2. The program does not handle cases of an invalid column index `n`.
3. The program does not handle cases with non-numeric values in the specified column.

Because the program does not work correctly for at least these potential cases, we can conclude that it is not correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
