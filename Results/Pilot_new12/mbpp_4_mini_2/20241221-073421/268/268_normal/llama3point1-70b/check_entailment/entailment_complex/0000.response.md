Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem description. While the function is intended to return the maximum value of the nth column of a given matrix, it incorrectly attempts to reference the (n-1)th element instead of the nth element due to the formula `row[n - 1]`. This causes an error for cases where `n` is equal to 0, which should not be a valid input per the problem description since it specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer within the range defined by the matrix dimensions. 

Additionally, if the matrix is empty or if `n` exceeds the number of columns, it will raise an `IndexError`, despite the annotations implying that these cases will not occur. Therefore, the implementation does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description, leading to failure for valid inputs based on the logic defined. 

To summarize, the function fails to return the correct maximum for the nth column and thus does not satisfy the problem description's requirements for all potential valid inputs.
