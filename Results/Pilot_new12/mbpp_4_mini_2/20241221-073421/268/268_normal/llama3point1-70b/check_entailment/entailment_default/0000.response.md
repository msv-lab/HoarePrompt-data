Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` is supposed to return the maximum value in the n-th column of a given matrix. However, the implementation assumes that `n` is a positive integer (1-based) without properly handling the case when `n` is 0. In Python, attempting to access an index of -1 (`row[n - 1]` when `n` is 0) will raise an `IndexError`. Additionally, the requirement that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])` is not enforced in the code, leading to potential access errors if the input does not meet this expectation. For example, if `n` is 0 or if the matrix is empty or has fewer columns than `n`, the program will fail. Given these potential errors, the function does not meet the problem's requirements for every potential case.
