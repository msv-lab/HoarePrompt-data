#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists of numbers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if matrix is not empty.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum value of the (n-1)th element from each row in the list of lists 'matrix', where n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) and matrix is not empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a list of lists of numbers, and a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. It returns the maximum value of the (n-1)th element from each row in `matrix`. It assumes that `matrix` is not empty and that `0 <= n < len(matrix[0])`, meaning it expects matrix to have at least one row and at least `n` columns. If `n` is 0, the function will not handle this case correctly and will raise an `IndexError` when attempting to access the (n-1)th element. Therefore, the function may fail or return an error for edge cases where `n` is 0 or if the matrix is empty, even though the annotations suggest that such conditions are managed.
