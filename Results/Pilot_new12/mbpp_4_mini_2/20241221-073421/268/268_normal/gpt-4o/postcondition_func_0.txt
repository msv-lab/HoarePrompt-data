The function accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a list of lists of numbers, and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value among the n-th elements extracted from each row in the matrix. If `matrix` is empty or if `n` exceeds or is equal to the length of the rows in the matrix, the code may raise an `IndexError`. The function does not handle these potential edge cases, which could lead to runtime errors.
