#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a list of lists of numbers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]) if matrix is not empty.
def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)
    #The program returns the maximum value from the n-th elements extracted from each row in the matrix.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a list of lists of numbers, and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value among the n-th elements extracted from each row in the matrix. If `matrix` is empty or if `n` exceeds or is equal to the length of the rows in the matrix, the code may raise an `IndexError`. The function does not handle these potential edge cases, which could lead to runtime errors.
