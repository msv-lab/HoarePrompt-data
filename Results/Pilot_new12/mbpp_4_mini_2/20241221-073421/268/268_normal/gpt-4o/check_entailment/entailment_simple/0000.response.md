Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(matrix, n)` is designed to return the maximum value from the n-th column of a given matrix, which is represented as a list of lists. This aligns perfectly with the problem description.

2. **Implementation Detail**:
   - The program extracts the n-th values from each list (row) in the matrix using a list comprehension: `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]`. This correctly captures all values in the n-th column.
   - It then uses the built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value among those extracted elements: `return max(nth_column)`. This is an appropriate and effective way to determine the maximum value in a list.

3. **Valid Input Assumption**: The problem description states that the input will be valid, meaning that `n` will be a non-negative integer and will always fall within the bounds of existing columns in the provided matrix. The function does not need to handle exceptions for out-of-bound indices since we assume valid input according to the description.

4. **Testing**: The included assertions (tests) confirm that the function works correctly for various test cases:
   - The maximum of the third column (index 2) from `[[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]]` correctly returns `19`.
   - The maximum of the second column (index 1) from `[[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]]` correctly returns `10`.
   - The maximum of the second column (index 1) from `[[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]]` correctly returns `11`.

Therefore, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description for every defined case, confirming its correctness.
