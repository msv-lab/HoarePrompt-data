Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input `matrix` is empty or where `n` exceeds or is equal to the number of columns in any row of the `matrix`. The output hints indicate that when these situations occur, the code may raise an `IndexError`, which means it does not meet the problem description for all potential cases.

For example:
- If the input is `func_1([], 0)`, it would raise an `IndexError` because the matrix is empty and there are no rows to extract a column from.
- If the input is `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4]], 2)`, it would also raise an `IndexError` because the index 2 exceeds the available column indices (0 and 1).

Thus, since the program does not handle these edge cases and can lead to runtime errors, the program is considered incorrect.
