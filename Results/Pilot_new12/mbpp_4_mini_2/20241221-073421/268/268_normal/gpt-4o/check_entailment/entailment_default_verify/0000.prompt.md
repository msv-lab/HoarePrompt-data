You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function which given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]], 2) == 19
assert func_1([[6, 7, 8], [2, 4, 6], [9, 10, 20]], 1) == 10
assert func_1([[7, 8, 9], [3, 5, 7], [10, 11, 21]], 1) == 11

def func_1(matrix, n):
    nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]
    return max(nth_column)


```
Original Assessment: The program provided aims to return the maximum value of the nth column from a given matrix represented as a list of lists. 

Here are the potential issues in the implementation:

1. **Column Indexing**: The program does not handle cases where the provided column index `n` is out of bounds, meaning it does not check if `n` is a valid index for the columns of the matrix.

2. **Empty Matrix**: If the matrix is empty (i.e., `matrix = []`), the code will also fail as it tries to access a column from an empty list.

Let's consider some test cases that reveal these issues:

- If `n = 3` is passed to a 3-column matrix like `[[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]]`, it would lead to an `IndexError` because it is trying to access a non-existent column.
- If the input matrix is empty `func_1([], 0)` will result in an `IndexError` as it attempts to access an index in an empty list.

Since we have identified that the program does not handle edge cases where the column index is out of bounds or where the matrix is empty, it fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `matrix`, which is a list of lists of numbers, and a non-negative integer `n`. It returns the maximum value among the n-th elements extracted from each row in the matrix. If `matrix` is empty or if `n` exceeds or is equal to the length of the rows in the matrix, the code may raise an `IndexError`. The function does not handle these potential edge cases, which could lead to runtime errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
