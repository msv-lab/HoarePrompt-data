The provided program correctly extracts the n-th column from a matrix represented as a list of lists and computes its maximum value. The program also adheres to the problem description for the provided examples. 

However, the output hints point out that the function does not handle potential edge cases, specifically when:

1. The input `matrix` is empty, which would lead to an `IndexError` when attempting to extract the n-th column.
2. The value of `n` exceeds or is equal to the length of the rows in the matrix, also leading to an `IndexError`.

Since the program does not account for these edge cases, it could fail and raise exceptions under certain conditions, which means it does not satisfy the requirement to handle all potential cases as described.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the `matrix` is empty or where `n` is out of bounds, leading to possible runtime errors.
