The program provided aims to return the maximum value of the nth column from a given matrix represented as a list of lists. 

Here are the potential issues in the implementation:

1. **Column Indexing**: The program does not handle cases where the provided column index `n` is out of bounds, meaning it does not check if `n` is a valid index for the columns of the matrix.

2. **Empty Matrix**: If the matrix is empty (i.e., `matrix = []`), the code will also fail as it tries to access a column from an empty list.

Let's consider some test cases that reveal these issues:

- If `n = 3` is passed to a 3-column matrix like `[[5, 6, 7], [1, 3, 5], [8, 9, 19]]`, it would lead to an `IndexError` because it is trying to access a non-existent column.
- If the input matrix is empty `func_1([], 0)` will result in an `IndexError` as it attempts to access an index in an empty list.

Since we have identified that the program does not handle edge cases where the column index is out of bounds or where the matrix is empty, it fails to meet the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
