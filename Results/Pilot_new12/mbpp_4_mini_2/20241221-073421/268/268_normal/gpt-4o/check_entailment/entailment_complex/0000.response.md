Correctness: **False**

The program does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases. While it correctly attempts to find the maximum of the nth column in a matrix represented as a list of lists, it lacks the necessary error handling for various cases specified in the function's annotations. Specifically, the function assumes that the index `n` is within bounds of the matrix rows without checking if the matrix is empty or if `n` is valid.

1. If the matrix is empty, calling `func_1([], 0)` will raise an `IndexError` because there's no row to access.
2. If the value of `n` is outside the valid range (for example, if the matrix has 3 columns and `n` equals 3), the program will also raise an `IndexError`.

While the problem description does not explicitly state that error handling should be included, the annotations of the annotated program indicate an understanding of invalid inputs. Therefore, the absence of checks for an empty matrix and out-of-bounds values means the implementation does not strictly guarantee correctness under all conditions.

These potential cases where the program can raise an `IndexError` lead to non-compliance with the problem's requirements. As a result, the program is deemed incorrect.
