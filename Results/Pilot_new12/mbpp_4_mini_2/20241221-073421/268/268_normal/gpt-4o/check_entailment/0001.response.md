To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze how the function `func_1` handles different scenarios as described in the problem statement: it should return the maximum of the nth column from a given matrix represented as a list of lists.

Let's break down the code:

The function `func_1` attempts to create a list `nth_column` that contains all the elements from the column indexed by `n`. It then returns the maximum value from this list.

**Checking for potential issues:**

1. **Column Indexing**: We need to ensure that the column index `n` is within valid bounds. If `n` exceeds the number of columns in the matrix or is negative, the code as written will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `row[n]` for a row that does not have that index.

2. **Empty Matrix**: If the input is an empty matrix (i.e., `[]`), attempting to access any column (`n`) will cause an `IndexError`.

3. **Matrix with Variable Row Lengths**: If the matrix rows are of variable lengths (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]]`), and `n` references a column index that exists for some rows but not for others, this will again raise an `IndexError`.

Now let's consider these edge cases with examples:

1. Testing with an out-of-bounds column index:
   ```python
   func_1([[1, 2, 3]], 3)  # This should raise an IndexError
   ```

2. Testing with an empty matrix:
   ```python
   func_1([], 0)  # This should raise an IndexError
   ```

3. Testing with variable row lengths:
   ```python
   func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5]], 2)  # This should raise an IndexError
   ```

Since the function does not handle these edge cases, the implementation is not correct.

Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle:
- Out-of-bounds indices which could lead to an `IndexError`.
- An empty matrix input which would also cause an `IndexError`.
- Rows of different lengths leading to unpredictable behavior.
