`nth_column` is assigned the list of the n-th elements from each row in the `matrix`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and within the bounds of the row length, `nth_column` is a list containing the values from the n-th column of the `matrix`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `matrix` is a list of lists of numbers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]), and `nth_column` is a list of the n-th elements from each row in `matrix`.

Output State: **`matrix` is a list of lists of numbers, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]), and `nth_column` is a list of the n-th elements from each row in `matrix`.**
