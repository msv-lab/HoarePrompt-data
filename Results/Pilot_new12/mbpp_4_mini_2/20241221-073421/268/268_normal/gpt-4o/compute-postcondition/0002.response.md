The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `matrix` and `n`. The parameter `matrix` is a list of lists of numbers, and `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n < \text{len(matrix[0])}\) if `matrix` is not empty. After executing the function body, it extracts the n-th elements from each row in the matrix and returns the maximum value among those extracted elements. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of lists of numbers (matrix) and a non-negative integer index (n) and return the maximum value from the n-th elements of each row in the matrix.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter matrix (a list of lists of numbers) and a non-negative integer n; it returns the maximum value from the n-th elements extracted from each row in the matrix.**
