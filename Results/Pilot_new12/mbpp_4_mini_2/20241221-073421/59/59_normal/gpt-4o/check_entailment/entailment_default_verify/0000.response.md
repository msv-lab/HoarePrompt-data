Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` successfully merges three lists as required by the problem description. It concatenates the lists and sorts the resulting list, which is demonstrated by the assertions that test various cases, including those with duplicates and varying ranges. The output hints clarify that while the function does not explicitly handle cases of empty lists or invalid inputs, it handles these situations gracefully by returning an empty list if all inputs are empty. Therefore, it aligns with the expectations set by the problem description and fulfills its functionality correctly.
