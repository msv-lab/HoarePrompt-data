Correctness: **True**.

The provided program merges three lists and sorts the combined list as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` concatenates the three lists using the `+` operator and then sorts the combined list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function, which is accurate and efficient for this task. The assertions provided demonstrate that the function works correctly for multiple cases, including cases with duplicate values, a mix of sorted and unsorted input lists, and different number ranges. Since all tested cases follow the problem description correctly and no edge cases were identified where the function would fail, the correctness can be confidently stated as true.
