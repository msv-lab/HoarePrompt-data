Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies the function `func_1` as correct based on the problem description. The function merges three lists, sorts them, and returns the sorted list as specified. The output of the function is verified by multiple assertions that cover various scenarios, including cases with duplicate values and mixtures of sorted and unsorted data. The provided annotations support this by accurately describing the function's behavior and confirming that it returns the expected sorted list. The assumption of valid input further supports the conclusion that the function operates correctly within its defined parameters. Thus, the assessment remains valid as it confirms the correctness of the program against the problem requirements.
