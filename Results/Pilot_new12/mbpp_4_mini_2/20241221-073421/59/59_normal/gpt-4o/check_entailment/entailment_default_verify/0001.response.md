Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly merges three lists and sorts the result as required by the problem description. The program was tested with various assertions, which confirmed that it returns the expected sorted lists in all provided cases. The output hints further support this correctness, indicating that the function handles merging and sorting appropriately. Although the function does not specifically handle empty lists or cases where inputs are not provided, it behaves as expected by returning an empty list when all inputs are empty. Since there are no cases where it fails to meet the problem requirements, the function's correctness stands affirmed.
