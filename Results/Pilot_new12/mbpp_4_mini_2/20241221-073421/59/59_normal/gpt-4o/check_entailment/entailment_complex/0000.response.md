Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function `func_1` that merges three lists of integers into a single sorted list, which is exactly what the problem description requires. Here's a breakdown of how the program fulfills the problem requirements:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes three parameters, all expected to be lists of integers (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`). This aligns with the problem description's expectations.

2. **Concatenation**: The program concatenates the three lists into a single list called `combined_list`. This is essential for merging the lists into one.

3. **Sorting the List**: After merging the lists, it sorts the combined list using the built-in `sorted()` function, which is a standard method for sorting lists in Python.

4. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the sorted list, which meets the requirement of producing a single sorted list from the three input lists.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: Although not explicitly stated, the function will naturally return an empty list if all the input lists are empty, which is a reasonable behavior for merging and sorting operations.

The assertions provided in the annotated program effectively test the function against various cases, including duplicates and varied input sizes, further confirming that the implementation behaves as intended.

Since the function consistently adheres to the problem description and meets specified requirements under valid conditions, the correctness of the program can be affirmed.
