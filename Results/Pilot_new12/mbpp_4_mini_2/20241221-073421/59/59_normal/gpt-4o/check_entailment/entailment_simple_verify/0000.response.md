Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the requirement to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` concatenates the input lists using the `+` operator, and then sorts the combined list using Python's built-in `sorted()` function. The annotated version of the code corroborates this functionality, demonstrating that the function operates as intended with valid input including various test cases. All assertions return the expected sorted lists, confirming that the program meets the problem description's requirements. Thus, the correctness of the program can be confidently stated as true.
