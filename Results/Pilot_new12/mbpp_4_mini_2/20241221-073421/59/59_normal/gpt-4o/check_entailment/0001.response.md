Correctness: **True**

The program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` concatenates the three input lists and then uses the built-in `sorted` function to return a sorted version of the combined list. 

The provided assertions successfully test the function with various cases, including lists that contain duplicates and ranges of values. The output of the `func_1` function matches the expected outputs in all assertions, indicating that it handles different inputs as required by the problem description.

Since I could not find any case where the function does not work as expected and all tested cases were successful, I conclude that the function is correct.
