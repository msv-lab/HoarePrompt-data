Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` takes three lists of integers as input, concatenates them into a single list, and then sorts that list before returning it. 

### Explanation:
1. **Merging the Lists**: The function uses the `+` operator to combine the three input lists into one called `combined_list`. This meets the requirement of merging the lists.
2. **Sorting**: The function then applies the `sorted()` function to `combined_list`, which sorts the merged list in ascending order. This aligns with the requirement to produce a "single sorted list."
3. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns the sorted list, which satisfies the expectation that the output should be a sorted combination of the three input lists.

Given that all test cases provided in the assertions pass, we can confidently state that the program correctly adheres to the requirements of the problem description for the given inputs. There are no cases in the provided problem description that the function fails to address. Thus, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
