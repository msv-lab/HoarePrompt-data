Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly concludes that the program is correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` successfully merges three input lists into a single sorted list. The provided assertions validate the function against various cases, including those with duplicates and different value ranges, demonstrating that the program behaves as expected under the specified conditions.

The annotations further support this conclusion by indicating that the function correctly concatenates the input lists and returns a sorted version of the combined list, aligning perfectly with the requirements set out in the problem description. Therefore, the initial assessment of correctness remains substantiated by both the logic of the function and the results produced in the assertions.
