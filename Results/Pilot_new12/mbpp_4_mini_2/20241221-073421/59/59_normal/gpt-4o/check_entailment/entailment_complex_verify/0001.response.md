Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list by concatenating the input lists and then sorting the combined list using Python's built-in `sorted` function. This behavior aligns with the problem description.

The provided assertions are comprehensive, testing various scenarios, including lists with duplicates and differing ranges of integers. The outputs match the expected results in all assertions, indicating that the function behaves correctly for the provided test cases.

The annotated version further clarifies the flow of the program, confirming that the function processes valid input lists of integers as intended. Moreover, the assumption that the input will be valid and no exceptional cases need to be handled does not impact the correctness in this context.

Overall, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, and the annotations support this conclusion.
