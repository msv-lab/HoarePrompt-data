Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` fulfills the requirements of the problem description by merging three lists into a single sorted list. It concatenates the three input lists, sorts the combined list, and then returns the sorted result. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function will return an empty list if all input lists are empty, which is acceptable according to the problem description.

Since the problem assumes valid input, the function correctly manages all expected scenarios, including cases where the lists may have duplicates, negative numbers, and are already sorted in various orders. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function outputs the expected results in these cases.

Therefore, I conclude that the implementation is correct for all valid inputs specified by the problem description.
