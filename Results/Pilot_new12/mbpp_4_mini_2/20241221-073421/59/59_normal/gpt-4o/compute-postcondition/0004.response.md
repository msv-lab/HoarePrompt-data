Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, all of which are lists of integers. It concatenates these lists into a single list called `combined_list`, then sorts this combined list to create `sorted_list`, and finally returns this sorted list. The function does not handle cases where the input lists are not provided or are empty, but it will still return an empty list if all three input lists are empty. The final output is a sorted list containing all integers from the concatenated input lists.**
