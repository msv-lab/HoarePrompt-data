The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Each of these parameters is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it returns the sorted version of the concatenated lists `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which is referred to as `sorted_list`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept three lists of integers and return a single sorted list that contains all the integers from those input lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters, list1, list2, and list3, all of which are lists of integers, and returns a sorted list containing all the integers from the concatenated input lists.**
