The variable `sorted_list` is assigned the value of `sorted(combined_list)`, which means it will contain the elements of `combined_list` sorted in ascending order. The values of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` do not change, but `combined_list` is still a concatenation of those three lists. Therefore, we can assert that `sorted_list` will be the sorted version of `combined_list`.

The output state is as follows:

Output State: **`list1` is a list of integers, `list2` is a list of integers, `list3` is a list of integers, `combined_list` is the concatenation of `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, `sorted_list` is the sorted version of `combined_list`.**
