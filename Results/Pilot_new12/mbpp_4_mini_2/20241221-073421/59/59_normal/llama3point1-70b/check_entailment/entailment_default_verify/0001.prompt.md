You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    return sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It does this by concatenating the three input lists using the `+` operator and then applying the `sorted()` function to the resulting list, which ensures that the final output is sorted.

Let's consider various test cases to ensure the correctness:

1. If all lists are empty:
   - Input: `func_1([], [], [])`
   - Output: `[]`, which is correct.

2. If one list is empty and two have elements:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 3], [], [2])`
   - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

3. If all lists contain different ranges of numbers:
   - Input: `func_1([5, 1], [3, 2], [4])`
   - Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is correct.

4. If there are negative and positive numbers:
   - Input: `func_1([-1, 0], [1, 2], [3, -2])`
   - Output: `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

5. If all elements are the same:
   - Input: `func_1([1], [1], [1])`
   - Output: `[1, 1, 1]`, which is correct.

6. If combining lists with strings:
   - Input: `func_1(['b', 'a'], ['d', 'c'], ['f', 'e'])`
   - Output: `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']`, which is correct.

The code works correctly for all these edge cases, demonstrating that it meets the problem requirements. Thus, the program is verified as correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three lists (list1, list2, and list3) which may contain integers. It concatenates all elements from these lists into a single list and then sorts the resulting list in ascending order before returning it. The final output is a single sorted list that includes all elements from the three input lists. It is important to note that if any of the input lists are empty or contain non-integer types, those cases will still be handled, as the sorted function will simply leave out any empty collections and only sort the integers that are present. If no integers are present at all, the function will return an empty sorted list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
