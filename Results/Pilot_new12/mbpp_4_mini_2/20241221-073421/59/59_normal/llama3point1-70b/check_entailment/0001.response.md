Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It does this by concatenating the three input lists using the `+` operator and then applying the `sorted()` function to the resulting list, which ensures that the final output is sorted.

Let's consider various test cases to ensure the correctness:

1. If all lists are empty:
   - Input: `func_1([], [], [])`
   - Output: `[]`, which is correct.

2. If one list is empty and two have elements:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 3], [], [2])`
   - Output: `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

3. If all lists contain different ranges of numbers:
   - Input: `func_1([5, 1], [3, 2], [4])`
   - Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, which is correct.

4. If there are negative and positive numbers:
   - Input: `func_1([-1, 0], [1, 2], [3, -2])`
   - Output: `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.

5. If all elements are the same:
   - Input: `func_1([1], [1], [1])`
   - Output: `[1, 1, 1]`, which is correct.

6. If combining lists with strings:
   - Input: `func_1(['b', 'a'], ['d', 'c'], ['f', 'e'])`
   - Output: `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f']`, which is correct.

The code works correctly for all these edge cases, demonstrating that it meets the problem requirements. Thus, the program is verified as correct.
