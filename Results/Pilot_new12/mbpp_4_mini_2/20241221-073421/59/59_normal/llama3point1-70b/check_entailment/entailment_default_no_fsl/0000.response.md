Correctness: **False**

The provided program correctly merges and sorts three lists, but it does not handle cases where the input lists may contain non-integer types as mentioned in the output hints. Specifically, if any of the input lists contains elements that are not integers (e.g., strings or floats), the `sorted` function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to sort such a mix of types. 

For example:
```python
func_1([1, 2, 'three'], [4, 5], [6, 7])
```
This will result in an error, contradicting the hint that states that the function should handle non-integer types by simply ignoring them and still return a sorted list of integers. Since the program fails to account for non-integer inputs, it does not satisfy the problem's requirements for every potential case.
