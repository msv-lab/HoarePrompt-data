Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes three lists, merges them into a single list, and then sorts that combined list. This meets the problem requirement of merging three lists into a single sorted list. The use of the `sorted()` function ensures that the resulting list is correctly sorted regardless of the order of the elements in the original lists. 

There are no potential edge cases or incorrect behaviors that I can find regarding the merging and sorting of lists, so the function is indeed correct for all inputs (including empty lists or lists containing negative numbers, strings, etc.). Thus, it adheres to the problem description fully.
