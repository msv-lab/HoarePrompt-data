Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** is supported by both the problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` takes three lists, concatenates them using the `+` operator, and returns the sorted result using the `sorted()` function. This behavior aligns perfectly with the task of merging three lists into a single sorted list.

The annotations confirm that before the function call, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are indeed lists, and the output is expected to be a sorted list containing all elements from the provided lists. The state mentioned in the annotations corroborates with the given problem statement, confirming that the inputs are valid lists and reflecting an understanding of the inputs and outputs correctly.

Furthermore, the various test cases outlined in the original assessment demonstrate that the function works correctly across a range of scenarios, including edge cases. 

Thus, the evidence from the annotations and the initial assessment strongly supports the conclusion that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
