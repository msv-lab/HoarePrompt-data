Final: **True** 

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` merges three lists and sorts the resulting combination, fulfilling the requirement of the problem description to create a single sorted list from three input lists. The provided annotations further clarify that the function can handle empty input lists and will appropriately sort the integers present, returning an empty list if no integers exist. Given that the input is assumed to be valid according to the criteria provided, the function behaves as expected, thus confirming the accuracy of the original assessment.
