Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The code correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list by concatenating the lists and using the built-in `sorted()` function. The output hints confirm that the function can handle empty lists or lists containing non-integer types, as the `sorted()` function effectively ignores any empty collections. Even if all lists are empty or contain no integers, the function will return an empty sorted list as expected. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
