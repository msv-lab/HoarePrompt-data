Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. It merges three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) into a single list by concatenating them using the `+` operator, then sorts the resulting list with the `sorted()` function.

Here’s the reasoning:

1. **Merging the Lists**: The expression `list1 + list2 + list3` effectively combines all three lists into one single list.
2. **Sorting the Merged List**: The `sorted()` function is applied to this combined list, which returns a new list with all the elements sorted in ascending order.
3. **Outputs the Correct Format**: The function directly returns this sorted list, meeting the requirement of producing a single sorted list containing all elements from the three input lists.

Since the function adheres faithfully to the task specified in the problem description — merging three lists and sorting the combined result — it is deemed correct.
