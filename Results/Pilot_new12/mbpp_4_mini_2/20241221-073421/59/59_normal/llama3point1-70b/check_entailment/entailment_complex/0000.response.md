Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem description. Here's the breakdown of why it meets the criteria:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` accepts three lists (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`) as arguments. It concatenates these lists into a single list using the `+` operator, effectively merging all their elements.

2. **Sorting**: After merging the three lists, the program uses the built-in `sorted` function to sort the combined list in ascending order. This guarantees that the resulting output will always be a single sorted list containing all elements from the inputs.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program's description mentions that if any of the input lists are empty, the `sorted` function will still return a valid output, which may be an empty list if no elements are supplied. This means that it correctly handles cases where one or more input lists do not contain any integers.

4. **Type Handling**: As stated in the annotations, the function gracefully handles scenarios where there are non-integer types or no integers at all, meaning that non-integer types will be ignored by `sorted`. This aligns with the expectation that the function should still provide a correctly sorted list, even if the inputs vary in composition.

5. **Output**: The final output will always be a sorted list that includes all valid elements from the three input lists, consistent with the problem description.

In summary, the function accurately meets the requirements of merging three lists and returning a sorted result while properly managing edge cases related to empty lists and non-integer inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is established as true.
