Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` successfully merges three input lists, which may contain integers or be empty, into a single list and sorts the elements in ascending order. The use of the `sorted()` function ensures the result meets the requirement of a sorted list. The provided output hints further clarify that the function correctly handles edge cases, such as empty lists or lists without any integers, by returning an appropriately sorted list. Since it adheres to the problem description without any contradictions, the final assessment is correct.
