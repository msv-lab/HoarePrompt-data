Functionality: **The function accepts three lists (list1, list2, and list3) which may contain integers. It concatenates all elements from these lists into a single list and then sorts the resulting list in ascending order before returning it. The final output is a single sorted list that includes all elements from the three input lists. It is important to note that if any of the input lists are empty or contain non-integer types, those cases will still be handled, as the sorted function will simply leave out any empty collections and only sort the integers that are present. If no integers are present at all, the function will return an empty sorted list.**
