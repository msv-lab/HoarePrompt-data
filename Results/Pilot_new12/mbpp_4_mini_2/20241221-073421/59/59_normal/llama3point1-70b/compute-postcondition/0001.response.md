The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. All three parameters are lists that may contain integers. After executing the function body, the function returns a single sorted list containing all the elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept three lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) and return a single sorted list comprised of all integers from these lists.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters list1, list2, and list3, and returns a single sorted list containing all the elements from these three lists.**
