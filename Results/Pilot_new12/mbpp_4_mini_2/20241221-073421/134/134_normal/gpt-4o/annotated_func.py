#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
    #The program returns 2 raised to the power of (n - 1), where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single parameter `n`, which is expected to be a positive integer. It computes and returns \(2\) raised to the power of \((n - 1)\). The function does not handle cases where `n` is not a positive integer, such as zero or negative values, nor does it perform any checks to ensure that the input meets the expected criteria. If `n` is indeed a positive integer, the final output will be \(2^{(n - 1)}\).
