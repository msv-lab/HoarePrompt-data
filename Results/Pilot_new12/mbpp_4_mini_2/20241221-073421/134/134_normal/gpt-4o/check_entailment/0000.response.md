Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients. The implementation provides a constant return value of `2 ** (n - 1)`, which does not represent the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices. 

For example, consider the case when `n = 4`. The binomial coefficients for `n = 4` correspond to the set {1, 4, 6, 4, 1} (these are the coefficients of the expansion of (a + b)^4). The coefficients at even indices (0, 2, 4) are 1, 6, and 1, which sum to 8. This is correctly captured in the assertion `assert func_1(4) == 8`, so in that specific case, the assertion passes, but the logic assumes constant output rather than calculating the sums dynamically.

However, if we consider `n = 6`, the expected sum of the even index binomial coefficients {1, 6, 15, 20, 15, 6, 1} should be 1 + 15 + 6 = 22, not 32. Therefore, the correct approach to arrive at the needed result was not implemented. Hence the function fails to provide correct results for various values of `n`, making it incorrect. 

Furthermore, `assert func_1(2) == 2` also fails since for `n = 2`, the coefficients {1, 2, 1} sum to 2 at the even indices, which matches the assertion. But again, this points out that the logic used in the function does not generally hold for all cases. 

Thus, the program is incorrect as it cannot be guaranteed to provide accurate results for various `n`.
