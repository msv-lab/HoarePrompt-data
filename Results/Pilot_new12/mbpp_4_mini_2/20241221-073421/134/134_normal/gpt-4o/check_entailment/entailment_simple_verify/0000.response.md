The original assessment concluded that the correctness of the program is **False**, arguing that the function `func_1` does not implement a correct calculation for the sum of even index binomial coefficients. Instead, it simply returns a fixed value computed as `2 ** (n - 1)`.

Given the annotated version of the code, we can see the function consistently produces the output based on this fixed formula without dynamically calculating any coefficients. This leads to several discrepancies between the expected results and the actual outcomes from the function for different values of `n`. 

### Analysis of Given Cases:
- For `n = 4`, the expected sum of even index coefficients should be `8`, which aligns with the assertion that `func_1(4) == 8`. However, this is merely coincidentalâ€”it does not imply the program is calculating binomial coefficients correctly.
- For `n = 6`, the expected sum of even index coefficients is not `32` but `22`, which the program does not return correctly. This indicates a fundamental flaw in the logic of the program.
- For `n = 2`, while the assertion holds true, it similarly suggests correct behavior due to the constant nature of the formula rather than a dynamic computation.

The annotations reinforce that `func_1` does not reflect the mathematical formulation needed to achieve its intended purpose stated in the problem description. The sum of even index binomial coefficients cannot be realized simply as `2 ** (n - 1)` in all cases.

### Conclusion:
Thus, the original assessment correctly identifies the flaws in the program's logic and confirms that the assertions do not validate the algorithm's correctness across all valid inputs. Therefore, I will maintain the original assessment.

Final: **False**
