Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements specified in the problem description. The description states that the function must find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). 

However, the implementation of `func_1(n)` simply returns \( 2^{(n - 1)} \). This calculation does not produce the sum of even index binomial coefficients as required. The even index binomial coefficients for a specific \( n \) would involve computing values such as \( C(n, 0), C(n, 2), C(n, 4), \ldots \) up to the largest even index \( k \) where \( k \leq n \). 

For example, for \( n = 4 \), the even index binomial coefficients are:
- \( C(4, 0) = 1 \)
- \( C(4, 2) = 6 \)
- \( C(4, 4) = 1 \)

The sum of these coefficients is \( 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 \). 

The assertion `assert func_1(4) == 8` seems to match this result, but the assertion is coincidental and does not reflect a general solution to the problem. For \( n = 6 \), the even index coefficients will sum to a different value, and \( func_1(6) == 32 \) does not hold since the correct value is \( 1 + 15 + 20 + 6 + 1 = 43 \).

Thus, the function does not adhere to the problem statement and fails to compute the correct sum for all inputs.
