The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` fails to compute the sum of the even index binomial coefficients as required by the problem description. 

The problem description specifies that the function should return the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). This sum can be calculated from the binomial coefficients \( C(n, 0), C(n, 2), ..., C(n, n) \). The annotations reiterate that the function returns \( 2^{(n - 1)} \), which does not align with the expected sums from the defined coefficients.

Moreover, the computed outputs for the test cases do not match the expected sums:
- For \( n = 4 \): Expected \( 7 \) (from \( 1 + 6 \)), received \( 8 \).
- For \( n = 6 \): Expected \( 31 \) (from \( 1 + 15 + 15 \)), received \( 32 \).
- For \( n = 2 \): Expected \( 1 \) (from \( 1 \)), received \( 2 \).

Consequently, since the program does not generate the correct results according to the specification, the original assessment stating that the program is incorrect holds true.

Final: **False**
