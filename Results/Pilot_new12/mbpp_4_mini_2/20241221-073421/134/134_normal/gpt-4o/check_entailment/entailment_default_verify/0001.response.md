Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` fails to compute the correct sums of even-indexed binomial coefficients for the provided inputs of \( n = 4 \), \( n = 6 \), and \( n = 2 \). While the output hints correctly describe the functionality of the program (i.e., how it computes \( 2^{(n-1)} \)), they do not reconcile with the program's requirement of calculating the sum of even index binomial coefficients as stated in the problem description. Hence, the program does not meet the problem's requirements, leading to the conclusion of its incorrectness.
