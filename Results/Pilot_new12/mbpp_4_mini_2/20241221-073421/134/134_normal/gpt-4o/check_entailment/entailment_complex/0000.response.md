Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem requires the function to compute the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. However, the implementation in `func_1` simply returns \(2^{(n - 1)}\), which is not related to the computation of binomial coefficients.

To elaborate, binomial coefficients, denoted as \(C(n, k)\), represent the number of ways to choose `k` elements from a set of `n` elements, and the even index binomial coefficients are those where `k` is even (e.g., \(C(n, 0)\), \(C(n, 2)\), etc.). The correct algorithm would involve calculating these coefficients for the specified indices and returning their sum.

Since the implementation does not adhere to the problem's requirements, we conclude that the program is incorrect.
