To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem requirement and the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

**Problem Description:** The function is supposed to take a positive integer \( n \) and find the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

**Understanding Binomial Coefficients:** The binomial coefficients can be represented as \( C(n, k) \), where \( n \) is the number of trials and \( k \) indicates the specific outcome group (0-indexed). The sum of even index binomial coefficients from \( C(n, 0) \) to \( C(n, n) \) for a given \( n \) can be determined using the formula: 

\[
\text{Sum of even index binomial coefficients} = 2^{n-1}
\]

This result arises because the sum of the coefficients can be simplified using properties of binomial coefficients and symmetry.

**Program Analysis:**
The function is defined as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

This function correctly applies the formula \( 2^{n-1} \) to compute the sum of the even-indexed binomial coefficients.

**Test Cases:**
1. For \( n = 4 \):
   - The expected sum is \( C(4, 0) + C(4, 2) = 1 + 6 = 7 \), but the program returns \( 2^{3} = 8 \) (incorrect).
2. For \( n = 6 \):
   - The expected sum is \( C(6, 0) + C(6, 2) + C(6, 4) = 1 + 15 + 15 = 31 \), but the program returns \( 2^{5} = 32 \) (incorrect).
3. For \( n = 2 \):
   - The expected sum is \( C(2, 0) = 1 \), the program returns \( 2^{1} = 2 \) (incorrect).

Given these examples, we can see that the function does not consistently return the correct sum of even indexed binomial coefficients for given \( n \).

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to correctly compute the required value for multiple inputs based on the problem description. Specifically, the outputs do not match the expected sums of even index binomial coefficients.
