Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to sum the binomial coefficients for all even indices from `0` to `n`. It uses the `math.comb` function to accurately compute the binomial coefficients, ensuring that only coefficients where the index `i` is even are included in the sum. The hints confirm that the output for cases, including when `n` is `0`, returns the expected result of `1` (since `math.comb(0, 0) = 1`).

The function handles all positive integer inputs correctly and adheres to the problem's requirements, effectively covering edge cases and expected behavior for the provided input. Therefore, all examples and potential cases point to the program performing correctly according to the problem description.
