Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices (0, 2, 4, ..., up to `n`), which is achieved by iterating through all indices from 0 to `n` and checking if the index `i` is even. If it is, it sums up the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the `sum` variable.

Here's why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function assumes a positive integer input `n` as specified, and it correctly handles this since the loop iterates from 0 to `n`.

2. **Calculation of Binomial Coefficients**: The use of `math.comb(n, i)` calculates the binomial coefficient \( C(n, i) \), which counts the ways to choose `i` elements from a set of `n` elements. 

3. **Even Index Selection**: The condition `if i % 2 == 0` ensures that only the coefficients at even indices are considered for the summation.

4. **Correct Summation**: After iterating and accumulating the values, the function returns the total sum, which is exactly what was requested in the problem statement.

In conclusion, the program adheres to the specifications given in the problem description and handles all cases conformantly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
