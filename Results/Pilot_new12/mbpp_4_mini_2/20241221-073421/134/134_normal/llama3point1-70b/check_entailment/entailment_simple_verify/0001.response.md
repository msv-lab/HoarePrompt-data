The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(n)` operates correctly under the assumptions made in the original assessment. The annotations reflect that:

1. The state before the function call establishes that `n` is indeed a positive integer.
2. The program computes `sum` by correctly iterating through all indices from `0` to `n`, checking whether each index `i` is even, and accumulating the binomial coefficients of those even indices.
3. At the end of the for loop, the annotation reaffirms that `sum` contains the total of the binomial coefficients for those even indices, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description.

The original assessment details the program's accurate execution for each of the discussed examples with expected outcomes. It also highlights that the function will operate correctly given valid input, which we assume includes only positive integers as described.

Based on the problem description, the program's implementation, and the annotations confirming the program behavior, the original assessment is accurate and well-supported. Thus, I conclude that the program meets the required criteria.

Final: **True**
