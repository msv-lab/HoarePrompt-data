Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices for a positive integer `n`. 

- The function uses a for loop to iterate through all indices from `0` to `n` (inclusive).
- It checks if the index `i` is even using `if i % 2 == 0`, which ensures only even indices are considered.
- For each even index, it computes the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` and adds it to the `sum`.
- After the loop, it returns the accumulated `sum`.

The logic accurately meets the requirements specified in the problem description, as it specifically targets even indices and computes their corresponding binomial coefficients. Additionally, it correctly handles all positive integers `n` as intended, providing non-negative integer results, which are the sums of non-negative binomial coefficients. 

Thus, the function fulfills the problem's request to find the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients, confirming its correctness.
