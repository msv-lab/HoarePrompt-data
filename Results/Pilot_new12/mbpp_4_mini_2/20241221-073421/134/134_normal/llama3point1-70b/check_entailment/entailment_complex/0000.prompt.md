You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `sum` is the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even `i` from 0 to `n`.
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even i from 0 to n, where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` in the range from `0` to `n`, inclusive. The function returns this sum. It ensures that only even indices are summed, and it operates correctly by utilizing `math.comb`, which computes combinations. The output is always a non-negative integer since it sums non-negative values (the combinations). Therefore, edge cases include when `n` is `0`, in which case the return value is `1` (the combination of 0 choose 0).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
