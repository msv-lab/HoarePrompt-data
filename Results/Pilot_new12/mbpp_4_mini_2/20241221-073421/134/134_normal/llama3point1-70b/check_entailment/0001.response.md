To verify the program's correctness against the provided problem description, we analyze the requirements that the function needs to fulfill. The goal is to compute the sum of binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \), specifically those coefficients that are indexed at even positions.

The provided program defines a function `func_1(n)` that sums the binomial coefficients \( \binom{n}{i} \) for all even indices \( i \) from 0 to \( n \):

1. It initializes a variable `sum` to zero.
2. It iterates through values of \( i \) from 0 to \( n \) inclusive.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if \( i \) is even using `if i % 2 == 0`.
4. If the condition is true, it adds the binomial coefficient calculated by `math.comb(n, i)` to `sum`.
5. Finally, it returns the computed `sum`.

### Edge Case Analysis:

1. **Checking Zero as Input**: 
   - The prompt mentions that \( n \) should be a positive integer. If we were to assume \( n \) could be 0, this would also involve the calculation \( \binom{0}{0} \), which is 1. The program handles this correctly since 0 is even and the sum would return 1.
   
2. **Behavior for Positive Integers**:
   - For positive integers \( n \):
       - If \( n = 1 \), the coefficients are \( \binom{1}{0} = 1 \) and \( \binom{1}{1} = 1 \). Only \( \binom{1}{0} \) (which is at an even index) would be included, resulting in a sum of 1.
       - If \( n = 2 \), the coefficients are \( 1, 2, 1 \) corresponding to indices \( 0, 1, 2 \). The sum would be \( \binom{2}{0} + \binom{2}{2} = 1 + 1 = 2 \).
       - If \( n = 3 \), the coefficients are \( 1, 3, 3, 1 \). The sum would be \( \binom{3}{0} + \binom{3}{2} = 1 + 3 = 4 \).
       - If \( n = 4 \), the sum would include contributions from \( \binom{4}{0}, \binom{4}{2}, \binom{4}{4} \).

### Correctness Verification:

The code correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement for every positive integer \( n \). There are no edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to deliver the expected output based on the description.

Since we've examined the implementation and confirmed that it behaves as predicted for valid inputs (positive integers) and the checks for even coefficients are correctly applied through the loop, we can conclude that the program meets the stated requirements.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**
