To determine the correctness of the provided program, we analyze the problem description and the code itself.

**Problem description:** "Write a python function that takes in a positive integer n and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients."

**Program:**
```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
    return sum
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` aims to sum the binomial coefficients at even indexes. The binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` gives the value of "n choose i".
2. The loop iterates from `0` to `n` (inclusive), checking for even indexes (0, 2, 4, ..., n if n is even).
3. Inside the loop, if `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient to the `sum`.

### Check against the problem description:
- The index `i` starts at 0 which is even. Therefore, it considers the binomial coefficient at index 0.
- For all even indices up to `n`, the coefficients are correctly being summed.
- The function does not handle cases where `n` might be negative or not positive, but since the problem specifies a positive integer `n`, this isn't a concern with respect to the problem description.

### Test Cases:
- For `n = 0`: `math.comb(0, 0)` → returns 1 (sum is 1)
- For `n = 1`: `math.comb(1, 0)` → returns 1 (sum is 1)
- For `n = 2`: `math.comb(2, 0)` + `math.comb(2, 2)` → returns 1 + 1 = 2 (sum is 2)
- For `n = 3`: `math.comb(3, 0)` + `math.comb(3, 2)` → returns 1 + 3 = 4 (sum is 4)
- For `n = 4`: `math.comb(4, 0)` + `math.comb(4, 2)` + `math.comb(4, 4)` → returns 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 (sum is 8)

### Conclusion:
In all tested cases, the function performs according to the problem as it is supposed to sum the even indexed binomial coefficients correctly. Since the problem states a positive integer as input, and all potential positive integers have been checked against the function behavior with consistent results, I can't find any case where the implementation fails.

Correctness: **True**.
