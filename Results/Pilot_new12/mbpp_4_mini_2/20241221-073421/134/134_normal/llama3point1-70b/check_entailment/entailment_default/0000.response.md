Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly implements the requirement of summing the binomial coefficients at even indices for a given positive integer \( n \). By iterating through the range \( 0 \) to \( n \) and checking if the index \( i \) is even, it correctly applies the combination function from the `math` module to calculate each coefficient. The output hints confirm that even for edge cases, such as when \( n = 0 \), it returns the expected value of \( 1 \). The function thus works for all valid cases as per the problem description.
