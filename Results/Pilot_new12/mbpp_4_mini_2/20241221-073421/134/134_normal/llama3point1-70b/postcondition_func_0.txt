The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` in the range from `0` to `n`, inclusive. The function returns this sum. It ensures that only even indices are summed, and it operates correctly by utilizing `math.comb`, which computes combinations. The output is always a non-negative integer since it sums non-negative values (the combinations). Therefore, edge cases include when `n` is `0`, in which case the return value is `1` (the combination of 0 choose 0).
