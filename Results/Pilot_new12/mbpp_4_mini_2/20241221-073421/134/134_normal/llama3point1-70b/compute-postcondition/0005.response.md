According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and how it interacts with `n`. The loop is designed to iterate from `0` to `n + 1`. Currently, `i` is 0, which is within the range (since `n` is a positive integer).

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will need to be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. This means that after the next iteration, `i` will be 1. The loop will still be able to execute again, as `i` will then be less than or equal to `n + 1`.

Hence, the variables at the start of the next iteration need to be updated to reflect this. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 1**
