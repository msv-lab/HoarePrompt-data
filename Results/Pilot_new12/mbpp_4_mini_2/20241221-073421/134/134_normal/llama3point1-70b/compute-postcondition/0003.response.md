To evaluate the impact of the code on the program, we need to analyze what happens when we run the statement:

```python
sum += math.comb(n, i)
```

Here, `math.comb(n, i)` computes the number of combinations of `n` taken `i` at a time, which is defined as:

\[
\text{math.comb}(n, i) = \frac{n!}{i!(n-i)!}
\]

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `sum` is initialized to 0.
- `i` is initialized to 0 and is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`).

When `i` is 0, the combination `math.comb(n, 0)` equals 1 for any positive integer `n`. Thus, the expression:

\[
\text{math.comb}(n, 0) = 1
\]

Therefore, when we execute `sum += math.comb(n, i)`, we effectively update `sum` as follows:

\[
\text{sum} = \text{sum} + 1
\]

This means the new value of `sum` becomes `1` since its previous value was `0`.

The variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged, so the possible states that remain valid include:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` is still 0 and remains even.
- `sum` is now 1.

Putting this all together, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 1, `i` is 0 and `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`)**.
