According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute for values of `i` from 0 up to and including `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, and the state of `i` can be even or odd. If `i` is even, `sum` is equal to 1 plus `n`; if `i` is odd, `sum` remains equal to 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1. Given that `i` currently has a value less than or equal to `n`, it can take on the value of `n + 1` in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be `n`, which allows `i` to increment up to `n + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to 1 plus `n` if `i` is even, else `sum` is 1, `i` is `n`**
