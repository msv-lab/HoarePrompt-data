The variable `sum` is updated by adding the result of `math.comb(n, i)` to it. The function `math.comb(n, i)` calculates the number of combinations of `n` taken `i` at a time, which is equal to `n! / (i! * (n-i)!)`. Since `i` is 1, this simplifies to `n` because there are `n` ways to choose 1 item from `n`. Therefore, `sum` will be updated to `sum + n`. 

The initial value of `sum` is 1, so after executing the code, `sum` will be `1 + n`. The other variables (`n` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is equal to `1 + n`, `i` is 1**
