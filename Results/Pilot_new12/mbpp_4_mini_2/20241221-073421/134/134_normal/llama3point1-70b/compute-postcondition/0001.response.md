According to the code, the for loop executes when `i` iterates through the range defined by `n + 1`. Since `n` is a positive integer, this means the range will be from `0` to `n`, inclusive. Before the loop starts, `sum` is `0`, but that does not affect the execution of the loop. 

For the loop to execute:
- `n` must remain a positive integer (which it is).
- `i` starts from `0` and will iterate until it reaches `n`, which is the behavior defined by the loop.

At the start of the loop:
- `i` will be `0`, and it will subsequently take on each integer value up to and including `n`. Therefore, no changes to the state of `n` or `sum` are needed, but we must specify the initial value of `i`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `sum` is 0, `i` is 0**
