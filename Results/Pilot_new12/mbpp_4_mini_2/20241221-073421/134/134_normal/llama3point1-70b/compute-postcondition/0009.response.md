The code snippet impacts the variable `sum` by adding the value of `math.comb(n, i)` to it. The variable `i` is defined as equal to `n`, and since `n` is a positive integer, `i` will also be a positive integer. 

The `math.comb(n, i)` function calculates the number of combinations of `n` items taken `i` at a time. When `i` is equal to `n`, `math.comb(n, n)` equals 1 (the case for taking all items), which means that whatever the value of `sum` was before, it will increase by 1.

Now, analyzing the initial conditions:
- If `i` is even, `sum = 1 + n`.
- If `i` is odd, `sum = 1`.

Since `i` is assigned `n`, it will determine if `sum` remains `1 + n` or becomes `1`. The value of `math.comb(n, n)` remains the same regardless of whether `n` is even or odd. 

So after executing the code, in both cases, we add 1 to `sum`. If `sum` was previously `1 + n`, it becomes `2 + n`, and if `sum` was `1`, it becomes `2`. 

Therefore, we conclude:
1. The status of `n` and `i` remains unchanged.
2. The value of `sum` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `sum` is 2 + `n` if `i` was even, else `sum` is 2.**
