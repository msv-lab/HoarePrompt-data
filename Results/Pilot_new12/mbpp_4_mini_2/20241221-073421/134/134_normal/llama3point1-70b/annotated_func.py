#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    sum = 0
    for i in range(n + 1):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            sum += math.comb(n, i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `sum` is the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even `i` from 0 to `n`.
    return sum
    #The program returns the sum of math.comb(n, i) for all even i from 0 to n, where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for all even integers `i` in the range from `0` to `n`, inclusive. The function returns this sum. It ensures that only even indices are summed, and it operates correctly by utilizing `math.comb`, which computes combinations. The output is always a non-negative integer since it sums non-negative values (the combinations). Therefore, edge cases include when `n` is `0`, in which case the return value is `1` (the combination of 0 choose 0).
