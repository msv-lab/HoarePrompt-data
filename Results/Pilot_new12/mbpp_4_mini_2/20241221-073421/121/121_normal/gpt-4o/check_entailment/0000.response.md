Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, it does not correctly implement the logic required to compute these prime numbers, as it is instead using a recurrence relation that generates a sequence of numbers rather than checking for primality or finding the specific primes in that sequence.

For example, according to the assertion `assert func_1(3) == 7`, the output for `func_1(3)` is expected to return the 3rd Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, which is indeed 7. However, the definition of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes involves prime numbers generated by their specific formula, and not simply the recurrence relation calculated in the code.

Additionally, there are no checks for whether the numbers generated are prime, nor does it maintain a count of found prime numbers up to the nth prime which is necessary. Given that the program calculates a sequence based on a mathematical relation without regard to primality, and because it incorrectly claims to provide the nth prime, this renders the program incorrect. 

For example, if you input `n=2`, the returned value is not guaranteed to be a prime (and would not be an accurate representation of the second Newman–Shanks–Williams prime). Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements as stated in the problem description.
