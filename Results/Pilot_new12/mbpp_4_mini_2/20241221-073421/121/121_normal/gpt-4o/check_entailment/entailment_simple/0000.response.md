Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the problem description, which requires the function to find the "nth newman–shanks–williams prime number." 

The program implemented in `func_1` calculates a sequence known as the Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) numbers, but it does not filter or identify the NSW prime numbers. The assertion tests included in the program check for specific NSW number values (7, 17, and 41), but they are not asserting the nth NSW prime numbers as requested in the problem statement.

To be correct according to the problem description, the program should specifically generate and return the nth NSW prime number, which requires additional logic to identify and filter the prime numbers from the NSW sequence. Since the function currently returns the nth NSW number rather than the nth NSW prime number, it does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description.
