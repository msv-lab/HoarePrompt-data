Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. While the outputs of `func_1` for n = 3, 4, and 5 match the corresponding Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers (7, 17, and 41), the program lacks a verification mechanism to ensure that the computed values correspond to the primes in all cases. 

The sequence being generated by the implementation is not guaranteed to remain within the prime numbers for all `n`. Therefore, the function fails to meet the specific requirement of outputting prime numbers, particularly beyond n = 5, which leaves ambiguity regarding the correctness of outputs for larger values of `n`. The program essentially computes a sequence based on the recurrence relation rather than ensuring the values are prime at each step.

Thus, the function's intended purpose as described in the problem statement is not achieved, justifying the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
