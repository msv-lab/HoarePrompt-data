The provided code for finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number fails to meet the requirements of the problem description as it does not compute prime numbers at all; it only calculates a specific sequence defined by the recurrence relation \( S_{\text{next}} = 2 \times S1 + S0 \). 

1. The assertions made at the beginning of the function (i.e., `assert func_1(3) == 7`, `assert func_1(4) == 17`, `assert func_1(5) == 41`) suggest expected outputs for specific inputs, but these values do not correspond to the actual nth Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. The actual prime numbers in this sequence are different and not guaranteed by the current implementation of the function.
   
2. In addition, the output hints indicate that the function does handle non-negative integers and state that for \( n = 0 \) and \( n = 1 \), it returns 1, which is incorrect in the context of prime numbers since the first prime number is 2, not 1.

The function's logic is fundamentally flawed regarding the calculation of prime numbers, leading to the conclusion that it does not satisfy the problem's requirements for all valid inputs.

Correctness: **False**.
