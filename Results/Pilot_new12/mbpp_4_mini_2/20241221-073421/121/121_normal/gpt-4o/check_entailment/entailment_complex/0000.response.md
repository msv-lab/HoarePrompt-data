The provided program attempts to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number based on its description. However, upon analyzing the function, we can see that it does not actually compute the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, but instead calculates a sequence defined by a relation involving previously calculated numbers. 

In particular:
1. The function returns `1` for both `n = 0` and `n = 1`, which does not match the expected series of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes (the primes start from `2`, `3`, and so on for `n = 0`, `n = 1`, respectively).
2. The sequence defined by `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0` does not correspond to the generation of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. The Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are specific prime numbers that cannot be obtained using this recurrence relationship defined in the function.

The program contains correct aspects regarding its variable handling and returns values, but fundamentally, it fails to implement the algorithm necessary to generate the actual nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime. Therefore, the output of the algorithm is not aligned with the requirements of the problem description.

Thus, the overall evaluation of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

This judgment is based on the clear discrepancy between the expected output (Newman–Shanks–Williams primes) and what the code is currently calculating, which is an incorrect numerical sequence.
