You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, it does not correctly implement the logic required to compute these prime numbers, as it is instead using a recurrence relation that generates a sequence of numbers rather than checking for primality or finding the specific primes in that sequence.

For example, according to the assertion `assert func_1(3) == 7`, the output for `func_1(3)` is expected to return the 3rd Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, which is indeed 7. However, the definition of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes involves prime numbers generated by their specific formula, and not simply the recurrence relation calculated in the code.

Additionally, there are no checks for whether the numbers generated are prime, nor does it maintain a count of found prime numbers up to the nth prime which is necessary. Given that the program calculates a sequence based on a mathematical relation without regard to primality, and because it incorrectly claims to provide the nth prime, this renders the program incorrect. 

For example, if you input `n=2`, the returned value is not guaranteed to be a prime (and would not be an accurate representation of the second Newman–Shanks–Williams prime). Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements as stated in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is 0, it returns 1. If `n` is 1, it also returns 1. For any other non-negative integer greater than 1, it calculates a sequence based on the relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, iterating through values until it reaches `n`. At the end of the execution, it returns the computed value of `S1`, which represents the result based on the values accumulated during the loop. The function does not handle negative integers, as it assumes `n` is always non-negative as per the initial comment, but it may not explicitly return a value for values greater than 1 in a clear way in the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
