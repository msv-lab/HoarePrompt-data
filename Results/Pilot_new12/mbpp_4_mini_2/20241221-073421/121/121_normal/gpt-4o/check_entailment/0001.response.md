Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The function implemented instead generates a sequence known as the Newman–Shanks–Williams numbers, which are not necessarily the primes.

For instance, let's check the outputs of the function `func_1` against known Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers:

- The 3rd Newman–Shanks–Williams prime (which is actually the 6th number in the sequence of primes) is 7, which matches `func_1(3)`. But,
- The 4th Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is 17, which matches `func_1(4)`. However,
- The 5th Newman–Shanks–Williams prime is 41, which matches `func_1(5)`.

However, the next prime in the sequence after the numbers returned (`1, 1, 7, 17, 41`) is not guaranteed. Therefore, the algorithm breaks the requirement of finding the nth prime specifically. There does not exist any evidence it handles cases where `n` could be beyond 5 or where the outputs would drift into non-prime values, which is a critical requirement based on the traditional sequence definition and the problem statement.

Thus, the overall implementation is incorrect for the upper boundary where prime checking is expected. The function's behavior is only verified up to `n = 5`, while the problem requires proper checking of the values to confirm they are prime. For instance, if we were to call `func_1(6)`, we are unable to validate if the output is actually the 6th prime without additional validation or proper definition, which could yield unintended results.
