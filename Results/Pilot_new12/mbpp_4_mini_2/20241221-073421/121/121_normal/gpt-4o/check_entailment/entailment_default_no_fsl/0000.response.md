Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires the function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, the provided code does not correctly calculate these prime numbers. The output hints describe a sequence calculated by the relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, which pertains to generating a sequence of numbers but does not filter them for primality or correctly return the nth prime in the specified series.

In fact, checking the values given in the assertions:
- `func_1(3)` returns 7,
- `func_1(4)` returns 17,
- `func_1(5)` returns 41.

These values may align with some known sequence but do not confirm that the function is specifically calculating the nth prime number in the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence accurately. Therefore, the lack of proper checks for primality and the specific definitions required for Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers leads to the conclusion that the program is incorrect. 

In conclusion, because the code does not guarantee that it produces the correct nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number for all inputs, it cannot be deemed correct.
