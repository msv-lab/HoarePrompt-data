You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, it does not correctly implement the logic required to compute these prime numbers, as it is instead using a recurrence relation that generates a sequence of numbers rather than checking for primality or finding the specific primes in that sequence.

For example, according to the assertion `assert func_1(3) == 7`, the output for `func_1(3)` is expected to return the 3rd Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, which is indeed 7. However, the definition of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes involves prime numbers generated by their specific formula, and not simply the recurrence relation calculated in the code.

Additionally, there are no checks for whether the numbers generated are prime, nor does it maintain a count of found prime numbers up to the nth prime which is necessary. Given that the program calculates a sequence based on a mathematical relation without regard to primality, and because it incorrectly claims to provide the nth prime, this renders the program incorrect. 

For example, if you input `n=2`, the returned value is not guaranteed to be a prime (and would not be an accurate representation of the second Newman–Shanks–Williams prime). Therefore, it does not fulfill the requirements as stated in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer and `n` is greater than 1
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer and greater than 1, `S0` is the value of `S1` from the last loop iteration, `S1` is the value resulting from the final iteration based on the previous states calculated in the loop.
    return S1
    #The program returns the value of S1, which is derived from the final iteration based on previous states calculated in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is 0, it returns 1. If `n` is 1, it also returns 1. For any other non-negative integer greater than 1, it calculates a sequence based on the relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, iterating through values until it reaches `n`. At the end of the execution, it returns the computed value of `S1`, which represents the result based on the values accumulated during the loop. The function does not handle negative integers, as it assumes `n` is always non-negative as per the initial comment, but it may not explicitly return a value for values greater than 1 in a clear way in the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
