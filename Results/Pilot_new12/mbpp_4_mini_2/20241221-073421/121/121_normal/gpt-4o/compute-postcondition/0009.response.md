Let's analyze the provided code snippet step by step. 

In the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is 3.
- `S0` is `old_S1`.
- `S1` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`.
- `S_next` is equal to `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`.

The code snippet:

```
S0, S1 = S1, S_next
```

This code performs tuple unpacking, meaning it will assign `S1` to `S0` and `S_next` to `S1`. The values of `S1` and `S_next` are derived from `old_S1` and `old_S0`.

Therefore, we can determine the new values of `S0` and `S1` as follows:

1. **Assigning new value to `S0`:**
   - `new S0` = `old_S1` (which is `S1` before the assignment).

2. **Assigning new value to `S1`:**
   - `new S1` = `S_next` = `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`.

Thus, after the operation, the updates will be as follows:
- `S0` will hold the value of the previous `S1`, which is `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`.
- `S1` will hold the computed value of `S_next`, which is `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`.

Now, replacing the `old_S1` with its value from the previous relation:
- `S0` now is `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`.
- `S1` is `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`.

In summary:
- `S0` is now `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`.
- `S1` is now `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`.

We have also retained the original information regarding `n`, `i`, and defined `old_S0`, `old_S1` values in relation to `n` through `S0` and `S1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `S0` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`, `S1` is equal to `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`.**
