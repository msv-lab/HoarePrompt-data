According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from 2 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, which is satisfied given that `n` is greater than 1 in the current state. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will begin at 2 for the first iteration. The values of `S0` and `S1`, which are both set to 1, do not influence the condition for the loop's execution since they are not referenced in the loop definition. 

Thus, the relevant states needed for the loop execution are:
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `i` is initialized to 2, which is the starting point of the loop.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and greater than 1, `i` is 2**
