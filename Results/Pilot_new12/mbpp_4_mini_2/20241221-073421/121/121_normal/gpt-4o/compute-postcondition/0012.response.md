To evaluate the code, let's break down the process step by step.

We start with:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
- `i` is 4
- `S0` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`
- `S1` is equal to `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`
- `S_next` is equal to `2 * S1 + S0`

In the code, `S0` and `S1` are assigned new values:
- The new value of `S0` becomes the old value of `S1`.
- The new value of `S1` becomes `S_next`.

Now we need to express `S_next` in terms of `old_S1` and `old_S0` using the provided equations.

Since we have:
1. `S0 = 2 * old_S1 + old_S0` 
2. `S1 = 4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`
3. `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`

Substituting `S1` into `S_next`:
- `S_next = 2 * (4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0) + (2 * old_S1 + old_S0)`
- `S_next = (8 * old_S1 + 6 * old_S0) + (2 * old_S1 + old_S0)`
- `S_next = 10 * old_S1 + 7 * old_S0`

Now we have the new state after executing the assignment:
- `S0` becomes the old value of `S1` which is `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`.
- `S1` becomes `10 * old_S1 + 7 * old_S0`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
`n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `i` is 4; `S0` is equal to `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0; `S1` is equal to `10 * old_S1 + 7 * old_S0.`

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `i` is 4; `S0` is equal to `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0; `S1` is equal to `10 * old_S1 + 7 * old_S0.**
