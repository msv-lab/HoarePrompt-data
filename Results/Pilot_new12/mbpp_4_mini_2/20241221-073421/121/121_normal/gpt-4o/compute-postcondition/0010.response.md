According to the code, the for loop will execute as long as `i` is between 2 and `n` (inclusive). The loop starts with `i` at 3, and for the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1. In this case, `i` will become 4. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `i` (now 4) is less than or equal to `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 4.

Thus, we need to update the state as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `S0` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`, `S1` is equal to `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`**
