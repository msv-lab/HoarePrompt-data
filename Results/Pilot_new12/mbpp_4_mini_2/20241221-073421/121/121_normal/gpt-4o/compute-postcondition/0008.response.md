To calculate the output state, we first analyze the initial values and how they will change as a result of executing the provided code. In this case:

Initial State: 
- `n` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 3
- `i` is 3
- `S0` is `old_S1`
- `S1` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`
- `S_next` is calculated as `2 * S1 + S0`

Now, executing the code `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0` updates the value of `S_next` based on the current values of `S1` and `S0`. 

Here's the breakdown of the impacted variables:
- `S_next` will now hold the value calculated from `S1` and `S0`.

The updated expression for `S_next` can be summarized as follows:
- Since `S1` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`, we substitute:
  - `S_next = 2 * (2 * old_S1 + old_S0) + S0`
- Therefore, simplifying further:
  - `S_next = 4 * old_S1 + 2 * old_S0 + S0`
  - `S_next = 4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`

The values of `n`, `i`, `S0`, and `S1` remain unchanged.

Now we can write the output state reflecting the unchanged variables and the calculation that has been made for `S_next`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `S0` is `old_S1`, `S1` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`, `S_next` is equal to `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`.**
