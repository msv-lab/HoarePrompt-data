The statement `S0, S1 = S1, S_next` performs a tuple unpacking assignment, where `S0` is assigned the current value of `S1`, and `S1` is assigned the value of `S_next`, which is defined as `2 * S1 + S0`. As `S_next` depends on the original values of `S1` and `S0`, we can denote the values of these variables before the assignment to analyze the output state.

After executing the code:

- `S0` now holds the previous value of `S1`.
- `S1` now holds the value of `S_next` which is recalculated as `2 * S1 + S0` (using the old values of `S1` and `S0`).

Therefore, we need to clarify what `S1` and `S0` were before the assignment to understand their values after execution.

Assuming:
- Let `S1` be `old_S1` (the value before the assignment).
- Let `S0` be `old_S0` (the value before the assignment).

Then:
- `S0` becomes `old_S1`.
- `S1` becomes `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`.

So we can convey this change effectively in the Output State.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `S0` is `old_S1`, `S1` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`, and `S_next` is calculated as `2 * S1 + S0`.**
