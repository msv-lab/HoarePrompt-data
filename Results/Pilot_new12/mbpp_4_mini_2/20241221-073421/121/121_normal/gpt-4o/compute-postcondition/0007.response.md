According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition involving `n`. The loop iterates from `i = 2` to `n`, which means that for another iteration to take place, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, we know that `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, after this iteration, `i` becomes 3. Also, for the loop to execute again, we require that `n` must be at least 3 (since `i` is now 3).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `S0` is `old_S1`, `S1` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`, and `S_next` is calculated as `2 * S1 + S0`**.
