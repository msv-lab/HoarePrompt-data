To simulate the execution of the provided Python code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables in the initial state.

Initial State: `n` is a non-negative integer and greater than 1, `i` is 2.

The code executed is:
```
S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
```

Here, `S_next` is assigned the value of `2 * S1 + S0`. However, the initial state is missing the values or definitions of variables `S1` and `S0`, which are crucial for evaluating `S_next`. Since the output must reflect the preciseness of the variable states post-execution, we note the relationship established by the executed code while emphasizing the lack of specific values for `S1` and `S0`.

Therefore, we maintain the initial values of `n` and `i`, and we acknowledge the computation defining `S_next` in relation to `S1` and `S0`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and greater than 1, `i` is 2, `S_next` is calculated as 2 * `S1` + `S0`.**
