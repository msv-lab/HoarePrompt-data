To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's first understand how the variables evolve during the loop execution.

The loop executes from `i = 2` to `i = n`, which means that the loop will run `n - 1` times, provided that `n` is greater than 1. The values of `S0` and `S1` change based on the formula provided in the loop.

Let's analyze the changes step-by-step through the loop iterations:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initially, `S0` is 1 and `S1` is 1.

2. **After executing the loop:**
   - For `i = 2`, 
     - `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0` which computes to `S_next = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3`.
     - `S0` takes the value of old `S1` (which is 1) and `S1` becomes `3`.
   - For `i = 3`, 
     - `S_next = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7`.
     - `S0` changes to `3` (which was the last value of `S1`) and `S1` changes to `7`.
   - For `i = 4`, 
     - `S_next = 2 * 7 + 3 = 17`.
     - `S0` changes to `7` and `S1` updates to `17`.

Continuing this way, we can derive a pattern for arbitrary `n`. After the loop has executed `n - 1` times, for a given `n`, we would have:

- `n` must be a non-negative integer greater than 1.
- `S0` will be the value of `S1` from the previous iteration (`n - 2`).
- `S1` will be joined with new calculations resulting from the last iteration.

After completing all iterations, if `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `S1` will be computed as a function of its previous states and will hold a particular value based on recursive relationships established in the loop.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations should reflect:
1. The final values of `S0` and `S1`.
2. The conditions needed for the loop to have executed (ensuring `n` is properly established).

Considering all of the above, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and greater than 1, `S0` is the value of `S1` from the last loop iteration, `S1` is the value resulting from the final iteration based on the previous states calculated in the loop.**
