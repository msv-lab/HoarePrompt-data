To simulate the execution of the Python code provided with the given initial state, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program and the values of the affected variables.

Initial State:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
- `i` is 4
- `S0` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`
- `S1` is equal to `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`

Code:
```
S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
```

Analysis:
1. The variable `S_next` is assigned the value of `2 * S1 + S0`.
2. We need to use the current values of `S1` and `S0` for this calculation.
3. The initial state specifies how `S0` and `S1` are defined in terms of their respective old values, but since the assignment of `S_next` does not change `S0` or `S1`, their definitions remain valid. The current values will be retained.
4. The overall state remains perturbed only by the new assignment of `S_next`.

Output State:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 4
- `i` is 4
- `S0` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0`
- `S1` is equal to `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0`
- `S_next` is equal to `2 * S1 + S0`

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4; `i` is 4; `S0` is equal to `2 * old_S1 + old_S0; `S1` is equal to `4 * old_S1 + 3 * old_S0; `S_next` is equal to `2 * S1 + S0`**
