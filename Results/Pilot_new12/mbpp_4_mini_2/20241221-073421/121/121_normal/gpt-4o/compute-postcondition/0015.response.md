The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` equals 0, the function returns the integer 1. For any non-zero `n`, the function returns the value of S1, which is derived from the final iteration based on previous states calculated in the loop. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 1 if `n` is 0, and return the value of S1 for non-zero values of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns 1 if n is 0; otherwise, it returns the value of S1 derived from the loop's final iteration.**
