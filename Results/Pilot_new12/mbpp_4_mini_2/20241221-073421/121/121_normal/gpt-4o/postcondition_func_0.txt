The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is 0, it returns 1. If `n` is 1, it also returns 1. For any other non-negative integer greater than 1, it calculates a sequence based on the relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, iterating through values until it reaches `n`. At the end of the execution, it returns the computed value of `S1`, which represents the result based on the values accumulated during the loop. The function does not handle negative integers, as it assumes `n` is always non-negative as per the initial comment, but it may not explicitly return a value for values greater than 1 in a clear way in the annotations.
