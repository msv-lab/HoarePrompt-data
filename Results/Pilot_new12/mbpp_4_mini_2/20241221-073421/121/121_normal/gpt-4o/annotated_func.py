#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the integer 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer and `n` is greater than 1
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer and greater than 1, `S0` is the value of `S1` from the last loop iteration, `S1` is the value resulting from the final iteration based on the previous states calculated in the loop.
    return S1
    #The program returns the value of S1, which is derived from the final iteration based on previous states calculated in the loop.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is 0, it returns 1. If `n` is 1, it also returns 1. For any other non-negative integer greater than 1, it calculates a sequence based on the relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`, iterating through values until it reaches `n`. At the end of the execution, it returns the computed value of `S1`, which represents the result based on the values accumulated during the loop. The function does not handle negative integers, as it assumes `n` is always non-negative as per the initial comment, but it may not explicitly return a value for values greater than 1 in a clear way in the annotations.
