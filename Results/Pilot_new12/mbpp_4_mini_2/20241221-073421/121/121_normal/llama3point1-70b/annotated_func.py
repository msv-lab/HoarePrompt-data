    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that n is a prime number
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself (by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`). It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number (i.e., it is greater than or equal to 2 and has no divisors in the specified range). Notably, the function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, as these cases fall outside its specified constraints.

    if (n == 1) :

    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find, and `n` is greater than 1.
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `count` is equal to `n`, `num` is the n-th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the position of a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find. If `n` is 1, it returns 7, the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. For values of `n` greater than 1, the function iteratively checks each integer starting from 7 to find subsequent Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers based on specific conditions. The function returns the `n`-th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is guaranteed to be a positive integer greater than 1 for `n` greater than 1. It is important to note that this function relies on an external function `func_1(num)` to determine if a number is prime, which is not defined within the provided code. If `func_1` does not correctly identify Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, the output may be affected. There is no explicit handling for cases where `n` is non-positive, which could be a potential edge case.
