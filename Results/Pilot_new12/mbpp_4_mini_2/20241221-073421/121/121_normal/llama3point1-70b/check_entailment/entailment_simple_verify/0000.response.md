Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. The first function, `func_1`, checks for the primality of a number effectively by returning `False` for numbers less than 2 and appropriately using a loop to check for factors up to the square root of `n`. 

The second function, `func_2`, follows the correct logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, starting with 7 and counting primes congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. The annotations align perfectly with the implementation, confirming the logic at each stage of execution, and the function reliably returns the correct prime for any valid input `n`. 

Thus, the program meets the problem's requirements, and there are no discrepancies noted in the annotated states. Additionally, the assumptions about input validity support the correctness of the program, reaffirming that no edge cases that could introduce errors are present given the guaranteed input conditions outlined.
