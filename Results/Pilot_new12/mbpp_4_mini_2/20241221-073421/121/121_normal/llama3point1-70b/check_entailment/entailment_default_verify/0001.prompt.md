You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```

#Function 1:
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

#Function 2:
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze it.

The problem asks for a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The program consists of two functions:

1. `func_1(n)`: Checks if a number is prime.
2. `func_2(n)`: Finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Primality Check (`func_1`)**:
   - The function checks if a number `n` is prime. It correctly identifies numbers less than 2 as non-prime, and uses trial division up to the square root of `n` to check for factors.

2. **Finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams Prime (`func_2`)**:
   - The code starts with the first known Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, which is 7.
   - It uses a while loop to check each subsequent number. It checks if the number is prime using `func_1`, and then verifies if `num % 6` is in `[1, 5]`, which is a correct property for Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.
   - When it finds an appropriate prime, it increments the count until it reaches the nth prime.

### Potential Issues

Now we need to check if there are any cases where the program may not work as expected.

1. **Edge Case for n = 1**: 
   - This case is handled explicitly by returning 7, which is correct since 7 is indeed the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

2. **General Cases for Larger n**: 
   - For values of `n` greater than 1, the loop increments `num` and checks every number for primality and the required property. The program appears to fulfill these requirements correctly.

3. **Large n Values**:
   - Although the code will eventually find the nth prime, its performance may degrade significantly for very large `n` due to the computational complexity of the prime check. However, this doesn't affect correctness; it affects efficiency.

### Conclusion

Since the program correctly identifies Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers regardless of the value of `n` (as long as n is a positive integer), and adequately handles the initial and general cases, I do not see any potential case where the code fails to work according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The provided implementation correctly generates the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number based on its definition and properties.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Output hints for function number 2 : The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the position of a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find. If `n` is 1, it returns 7, the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. For values of `n` greater than 1, the function iteratively checks each integer starting from 7 to find subsequent Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers based on specific conditions. The function returns the `n`-th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is guaranteed to be a positive integer greater than 1 for `n` greater than 1. It is important to note that this function relies on an external function `func_1(num)` to determine if a number is prime, which is not defined within the provided code. If `func_1` does not correctly identify Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, the output may be affected. There is no explicit handling for cases where `n` is non-positive, which could be a potential edge case.+


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
