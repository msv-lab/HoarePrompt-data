Correctness: **False**

The function `func_2` is intended to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, but it doesn't handle the case where the input `n` is less than or equal to 0. According to the problem description, `n` should be a positive integer, but the function does not enforce this condition. This means if a user inputs a value such as `0` or a negative integer, the behavior of the code will not align with the stated requirements of finding the nth prime number. Consequently, this represents a potential edge case that is not accounted for, resulting in the program being deemed incorrect. 

Furthermore, the annotations mention that if `n` is 1, it returns 7, which is correct; however, without handling for cases where `n` could be invalid (non-positive), the function fails to adhere fully to the specifications outlined in the problem description.
