Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for edge cases where the input `n` is non-positive. The problem description states that it is supposed to find the `n`-th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which implies that `n` should be a positive integer. However, both functions lack explicit checks or handling for scenarios where `n` could be 0 or negative. This could lead to the program entering an infinite loop in `func_2`, since it would never meet the condition to exit if `n` is not greater than 1.

For example:
- If `n = 0` is input, `func_2` would not enter the first conditional for returning 7 and would continue to increment `num` indefinitely without finding a valid output.
- If `n` were negative (e.g., `n = -1`), the function would similarly malfunction and not address the case of negatives.

Thus, since the functions do not handle all possible edge cases, the result is incorrect.
