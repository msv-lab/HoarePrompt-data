To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze it.

The problem asks for a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. The program consists of two functions:

1. `func_1(n)`: Checks if a number is prime.
2. `func_2(n)`: Finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Primality Check (`func_1`)**:
   - The function checks if a number `n` is prime. It correctly identifies numbers less than 2 as non-prime, and uses trial division up to the square root of `n` to check for factors.

2. **Finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams Prime (`func_2`)**:
   - The code starts with the first known Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, which is 7.
   - It uses a while loop to check each subsequent number. It checks if the number is prime using `func_1`, and then verifies if `num % 6` is in `[1, 5]`, which is a correct property for Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.
   - When it finds an appropriate prime, it increments the count until it reaches the nth prime.

### Potential Issues

Now we need to check if there are any cases where the program may not work as expected.

1. **Edge Case for n = 1**: 
   - This case is handled explicitly by returning 7, which is correct since 7 is indeed the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

2. **General Cases for Larger n**: 
   - For values of `n` greater than 1, the loop increments `num` and checks every number for primality and the required property. The program appears to fulfill these requirements correctly.

3. **Large n Values**:
   - Although the code will eventually find the nth prime, its performance may degrade significantly for very large `n` due to the computational complexity of the prime check. However, this doesn't affect correctness; it affects efficiency.

### Conclusion

Since the program correctly identifies Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers regardless of the value of `n` (as long as n is a positive integer), and adequately handles the initial and general cases, I do not see any potential case where the code fails to work according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True** 

The provided implementation correctly generates the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number based on its definition and properties.
