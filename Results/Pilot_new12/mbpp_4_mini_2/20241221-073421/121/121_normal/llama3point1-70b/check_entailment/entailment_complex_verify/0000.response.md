Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies the program as correct based on the provided problem description and the functionality of the code. The first function, `func_1`, effectively checks for primality, ensuring it only returns `True` for prime numbers. The annotated version clearly outlines that it handles non-negative integers and correctly identifies when a number is prime.

The second function, `func_2`, correctly implements the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number by starting at 7 and checking each subsequent number for primality using `func_1`. It ensures that the prime numbers returned are congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6, thus consistently finding the required primes as specified.

The annotations confirm that the control flow and variable states align with the intended behavior of the program. Additionally, the assumption that valid input is provided aligns with the decision points in the function logic.

Given this analysis, there are no inconsistencies or edge cases that would undermine the correctness of the program as per the problem description. Thus, the original assessment remains accurate, affirming that the program meets the requirements specified.
