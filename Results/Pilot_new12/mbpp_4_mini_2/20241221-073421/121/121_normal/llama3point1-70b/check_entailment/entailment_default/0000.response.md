The provided code attempts to implement a function that finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. Let's analyze the two functions and the corresponding output hints.

**Function 1: `func_1(n)`**
- This function checks if a number `n` is prime. 
- The function returns `False` if `n` is less than 2 (correct behavior according to the definition of prime numbers). 
- For any `n` greater than or equal to 2, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`. This is a standard and correct method for prime checking.
- However, it does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, as noted in the hint, but it aligns with the assumption that input will be valid (non-negative integers).

**Function 2: `func_2(n)`**
- This function is designed to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 
- If `n` is 1, it correctly returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
- For `n` greater than 1, the function iterates starting from 7 and checks two conditions: whether the number is prime (using `func_1`) and whether it is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. 
- The counting mechanism for prime numbers ensures that as soon as it finds the nth prime, it returns it.

The output hints outline these functionalities accurately. However, a critical gap exists when the function considers non-positive integers for `n`. Specifically, if `n` is less than 1, neither function addresses this case. Thus, if a user were to input `n = 0` or a negative integer, the function would not produce meaningful output, leading to potential logical errors. 

Even though the assumption states inputs will be valid, the requirement of the problem does not make any explicit restrictions on valid inputs, suggesting the code must account for at least valid logical boundaries like `n` being positive in the context provided. Given that there are potential cases where the program would not handle input correctly, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

A significant missing logic is the lack of handling for cases where `n` is non-positive, meaning the function might lead to unintended behavior if such input is provided.
