Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number as described in the problem statement.

### Explanation:
1. **Function 1 (func_1)**:
   - This function checks if a number is prime. It correctly implements prime checking by:
     - Returning `False` for numbers less than 2.
     - Iterating through potential divisors up to the square root of `n`.
     - Returning `True` only if `n` is not divisible by any of these potential divisors.
   - This implementation is correct and necessary since the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime must be prime.

2. **Function 2 (func_2)**:
   - This function is intended to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
   - It begins by checking if `n` is 1, returning 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
   - For subsequent primes (when n > 1), it uses a loop that:
     - Checks if a number is prime using `func_1`.
     - Also checks if the number is of the form 6k Â± 1, which is characteristic of these primes.
     - It keeps a count of found Newman-Shanks-Williams primes and returns the nth one when it is found.
   - The logic of iterating through natural numbers, checking for primality, and ensuring the format aligns with the concept of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes is correctly implemented.

### Conclusion:
The program follows the problem description accurately by appropriately defining primes and specifically finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, thus meeting all stated requirements.
