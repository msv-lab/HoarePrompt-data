Correctness: **True**.

The program consists of two functions. The first function `func_1` correctly checks if a number is prime by returning `False` for numbers less than 2 and iterating up to the square root of the number to check for factors. 

The second function `func_2` generates the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number starting from 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. It correctly uses `func_1` to check for primality and ensures that these prime numbers are congruent to either 1 or 5 modulo 6, which matches the definition of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.

The logic of finding these primes works for all natural numbers `n`, and the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description without missing any edge cases. Thus, no counterexamples can be found, confirming the program's correctness.
