Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the position of a Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find. If `n` is 1, it returns 7, the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. For values of `n` greater than 1, the function iteratively checks each integer starting from 7 to find subsequent Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers based on specific conditions. The function returns the `n`-th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is guaranteed to be a positive integer greater than 1 for `n` greater than 1. It is important to note that this function relies on an external function `func_1(num)` to determine if a number is prime, which is not defined within the provided code. If `func_1` does not correctly identify Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, the output may be affected. There is no explicit handling for cases where `n` is non-positive, which could be a potential edge case.**
