The variable `count` is incremented by 1, and since the initial state indicates that only `num` is increased by 1 while `count` remains unaffected until this line executes, the only change here is the increment of `count`. The previous state mentions that `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and that `num` was incremented but doesn't affect the operation of counting. The condition of `func_1(num)` not holding does not affect `count` either.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `count` is increased by 1; `num` is increased by 1, and the condition of `func_1(num)` does not hold.**
