In this case, the `while` loop condition is `True`, which means it will always execute at least once regardless of the state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute its first iteration. The existing state is sufficient for the loop to begin. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find, and `n` is greater than 1; `count` is 1; `num` is 7.**
