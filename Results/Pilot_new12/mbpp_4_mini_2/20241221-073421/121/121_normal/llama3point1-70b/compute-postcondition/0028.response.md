Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `num` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `count` remains unchanged. If `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, `count` is increased by 1. If after this `count` equals `n`, the function returns the value of `num`; otherwise, there is no return value. If `num % 6` is not 1 or 5, no changes are made to `count`, `num`, or `n`.***
