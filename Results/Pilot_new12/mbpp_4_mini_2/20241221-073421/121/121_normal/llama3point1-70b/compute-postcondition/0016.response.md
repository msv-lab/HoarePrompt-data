According to the code, since the loop is a `while True`, it can execute indefinitely unless there is an external breaking condition. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any state variables to ensure that the loop executes one more time. The current state allows the loop to continue running.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `count` remains unchanged; `num` is increased by 1, and the condition of `func_1(num)` does not hold.**
