Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1 representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find. If `func_1(num)` returns true (indicating that `num % 6` is either 1 or 5 and `count` is not equal to `n`), then `count` equals 2, and `num` is 7. Otherwise, there is no change to `count` or `num`, and the condition of `func_1(num)` does not hold.***
