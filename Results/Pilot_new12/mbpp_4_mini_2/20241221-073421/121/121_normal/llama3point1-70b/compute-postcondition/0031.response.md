The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find. 

- If `n` is 1, the function returns the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number at position 1, which is 7. 
- If `n` is greater than 1, it returns a value of `num`, which corresponds to the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 
- Additionally, if `n` is greater than 1, the function may return `num` increased by 1, or just return `num`, which is a positive integer greater than 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number at that position, with specific cases for when `n` equals 1 and when `n` is greater than 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer. If n is 1, it returns 7. If n is greater than 1, it returns the corresponding Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number for that position, potentially with variations in the return value based on the calculations performed within the function.**
