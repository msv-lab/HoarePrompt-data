To analyze the output state after the loop in the given code executes, we focus on the values and relationships of the variables involved as the loop progresses.

### Initial State:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find.
- `count` is initialized to 1.
- `num` is initialized to 7.

### Loop Code:
```
while True:
    if func_1(num):
        if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
            count += 1
            if count == n:
                return num
    num += 1
```

### Output State Analysis:
After the loop executes until the desired condition is met:

- The loop will continue indefinitely until `count` reaches `n`, meaning the loop will execute a number of times determined by how many valid prime numbers the function `func_1(num)` returns, specifically matching the additional criteria of `num % 6 in [1, 5]`.
- Initially, `count` starts at 1, meaning the next prime number to be counted (if `func_1` returns True and the number meets the modulo condition) would be counted from there.
- The final value of `num` when the loop exits will be the largest number that met the conditions (i.e., the n-th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime).
- After the loop has completed, it is guaranteed `count` will equal `n`.

### Derived Output State:
Based on the analysis, we summarize the final output states:

- If the loop has executed `k` times, where `count` has reached `n`, the following conditions hold:
  - `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, signifying the final count reached the desired position.
  - `count` is equal to `n`.
  - `num` is the n-th prime validated by the function `func_1(num)` and the modulo condition, which is greater than or equal to 7, depending on the loop execution path.

Output State: **`count` is equal to `n`, `num` is the n-th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 1.**
