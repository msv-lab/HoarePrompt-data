Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1. If `num` % 6 results in 1 or 5, `count` is increased by 1 and `num` is also increased by 1. If `count` equals `n`, the function returns `num` which is now a positive integer greater than 1. If the condition does not hold, the program executes the corresponding logic without an else part.***
