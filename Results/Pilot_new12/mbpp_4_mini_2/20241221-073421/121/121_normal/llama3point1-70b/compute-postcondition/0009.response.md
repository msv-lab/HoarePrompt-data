The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 1, so after execution, `count` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find, `count` is 2, `num` is 7, and the function `func_1(num)` returns true. The result of `num % 6` is either 1 or 5.
