Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `num` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `count` remains unchanged. If `num % 6` is either 1 or 5, then `count` is increased by 1, and if `count` equals `n`, the function returns the value of `num`. Otherwise, there is no return value.***
