The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is a prime number. It returns `False` if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` has any divisors other than 1 and itself (by checking divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `n`). It returns `True` if `n` is a prime number (i.e., it is greater than or equal to 2 and has no divisors in the specified range). Notably, the function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, as these cases fall outside its specified constraints.
