Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The function `func_1` correctly accepts non-negative float or integer inputs for `radius` and `height`, applies the formula, and returns the computed volume. 

While the output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where the input values are negative or non-numeric, the original problem description and the context of the function's intended usage assume valid input will be provided. The program behaves correctly under these assumptions, producing accurate results for valid inputs as outlined in the problem description and supported by the output hints. 

Thus, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
