You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius is a non-negative float or integer representing the radius of the cone's base, and height is a non-negative float or integer representing the height of the cone.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height
    #The program returns the volume of the cone calculated using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height, where radius is a non-negative float or integer and height is a non-negative float or integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which must be non-negative floats or integers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. The function does not handle cases where the input values are negative or non-numeric, so any such inputs would cause an error. The function assumes valid input as described, which is stated in the annotations. After execution, the program provides the computed volume of the cone.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
