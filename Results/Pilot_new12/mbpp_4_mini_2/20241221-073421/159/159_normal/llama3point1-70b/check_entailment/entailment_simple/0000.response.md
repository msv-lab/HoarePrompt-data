Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function that calculates the volume of a cone as specified in the problem description. The formula used in the function, `(1/3) * π * radius² * height`, accurately represents the mathematical formula for the volume of a cone. Additionally, the program specifies that `radius` and `height` are non-negative floats or integers, which aligns perfectly with the problem's requirements. 

Since it is stated that valid inputs will be provided and there are no exceptional cases to consider (such as negative or zero values for radius or height), the function will always produce the correct volume for the cone, assuming the inputs meet the specified criteria. Thus, the program meets the problem requirements comprehensively.
