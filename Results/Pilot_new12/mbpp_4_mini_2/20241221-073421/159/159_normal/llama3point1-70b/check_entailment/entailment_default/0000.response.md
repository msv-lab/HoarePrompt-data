The code provided correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. 

The output hints confirm that the function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both required to be non-negative floats or integers. They also state that the function calculates the volume according to the correct formula and returns the computed volume.

However, the hints note that the function does not handle cases where the input values are negative or non-numeric. This could lead to runtime errors if the function is applied to invalid input types or values. Since the problem description does not indicate that the input will always be valid and assumes valid inputs, the lack of handling for negative or invalid values means the function does not fulfill the problem description for every potential case.

In this context, since the assumption of valid input is clouded by the possibility of incorrect input leading to an error, I conclude that the function cannot be considered correct under all circumstances.

Correctness: **False**.
