Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The function `func_1` takes the radius and height as inputs, applies this formula, and returns the volume. 

1. It uses the Python `math` library to get the value of Ï€ accurately.
2. The formula applies correctly for all non-negative values of radius and height, returning a valid volume for a cone. 
3. The volume of a cone is always defined for non-negative values since a negative radius or height would not make sense geometrically. 

There are no edge cases or input scenarios that the program fails to handle given the typical definitions of radius and height in geometry.
