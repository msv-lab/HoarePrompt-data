Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input values for `radius` and `height` are negative or non-numeric. According to the output hints, both parameters must be non-negative floats or integers. However, the current implementation will throw an error if negative values or non-numeric input are provided, which means it does not meet the specifications outlined in the problem description. An example case where the program fails is when `func_1(-1, 5)` is called, which leads to an incorrect result due to the negative radius.
