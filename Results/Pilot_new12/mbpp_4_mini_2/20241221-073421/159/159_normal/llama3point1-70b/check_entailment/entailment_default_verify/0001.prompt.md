You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1.0 / 3 * math.pi * radius * radius * height


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone, and \( h \) is the height. 

The function:
1. Takes two arguments: `radius` and `height`.
2. Computes the volume using the formula above by multiplying \( \frac{1}{3} \) with \( \pi \), the square of the radius, and the height.
3. It correctly imports the `math` module to access the constant \( \pi \).

The program handles positive values of `radius` and `height` as expected for the cone's dimensions. The absence of conditions to handle negative or zero values could be considered an oversight, but the problem description does not specify that the inputs need to be validated for positivity or that the function must handle such cases. Therefore, as per the scope of the problem, the function is sufficient for calculating the volume of a cone when valid positive inputs are provided.

Since I can't think of any inputs where the code fails to provide the correct output for the problem as described, I conclude that the code is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which must be non-negative floats or integers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. The function does not handle cases where the input values are negative or non-numeric, so any such inputs would cause an error. The function assumes valid input as described, which is stated in the annotations. After execution, the program provides the computed volume of the cone.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
