Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

where \( r \) is the radius of the base of the cone, and \( h \) is the height. 

The function:
1. Takes two arguments: `radius` and `height`.
2. Computes the volume using the formula above by multiplying \( \frac{1}{3} \) with \( \pi \), the square of the radius, and the height.
3. It correctly imports the `math` module to access the constant \( \pi \).

The program handles positive values of `radius` and `height` as expected for the cone's dimensions. The absence of conditions to handle negative or zero values could be considered an oversight, but the problem description does not specify that the inputs need to be validated for positivity or that the function must handle such cases. Therefore, as per the scope of the problem, the function is sufficient for calculating the volume of a cone when valid positive inputs are provided.

Since I can't think of any inputs where the code fails to provide the correct output for the problem as described, I conclude that the code is correct.
