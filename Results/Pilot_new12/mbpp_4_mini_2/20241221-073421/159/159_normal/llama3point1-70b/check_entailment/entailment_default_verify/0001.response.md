Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to calculate the volume of a cone as specified in the problem description. The volume is calculated using the provided formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), and the function `func_1(radius, height)` takes the appropriate parameters and correctly computes the volume.

Despite the lack of input validation for negative values or non-numeric types, the original assessment rightly identifies that the problem description does not require these checks. The output hints confirm that the program is designed to work under the assumption of valid, non-negative inputs. There are no inputs within the defined problem scope that would cause the function to produce incorrect results.

Therefore, the original assessment of correctness accurately reflects the program's functionality as described, and I conclude that the program is indeed correct.
