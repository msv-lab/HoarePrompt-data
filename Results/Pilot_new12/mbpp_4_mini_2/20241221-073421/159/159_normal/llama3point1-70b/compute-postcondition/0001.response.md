The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative floats or integers that represent the radius of the cone's base and the height of the cone, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the volume of the cone, which is calculated using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative float or integer parameters `radius` and `height`, and return the volume of the cone based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `radius` and `height`, both non-negative floats or integers, and returns the volume of the cone calculated using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height.**
