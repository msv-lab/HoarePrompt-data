The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers. After executing the function body, it calculates and returns the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, and return the volume of a cone calculated using these parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of a cone calculated as (1/3) * π * radius² * height.**
