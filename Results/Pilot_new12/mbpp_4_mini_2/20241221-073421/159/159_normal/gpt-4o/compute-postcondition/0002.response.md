Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, and calculates the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. The function returns this volume. It does not handle cases where the inputs are negative or non-numeric, which could lead to runtime errors. However, if both inputs are valid, the function accurately computes and returns the volume of the cone, ensuring that the specification aligns with the mathematical definition.**
