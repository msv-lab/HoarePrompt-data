Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

Where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone. 

1. The function `func_1(radius, height)` is defined correctly according to the formula for the volume of a cone.
2. The provided assertions test the function using known values for the radius and height, and the expected results match the calculations.
3. The use of `math.isclose` ensures that floating point arithmetic errors will not lead to false negatives when checking the results.
4. No edge cases are overlooked since the formula holds for any non-negative values of radius and height. Even if either radius or height is zero, the formula correctly computes the volume as zero.

Since the function behaves as expected for the provided cases and follows the volume formula, no counterexamples can be found, thus validating the correctness of the program.
