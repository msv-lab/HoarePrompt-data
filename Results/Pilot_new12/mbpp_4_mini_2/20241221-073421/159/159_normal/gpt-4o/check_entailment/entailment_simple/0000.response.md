Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function that calculates the volume of a cone based on the given formula: \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone. The function `func_1(radius, height)` takes two non-negative inputs (radius and height), which aligns with the problem description stating to find the volume of a cone. 

The correctness is further validated by the `assert` statements that test the function with various inputs, confirming that it produces expected outputs within a relative tolerance of 0.001. Since the function consistently calculates the volume of a cone correctly according to the mathematical formula provided, it meets all specifications of the problem description. Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
