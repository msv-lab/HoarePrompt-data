You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(5, 12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(10, 15), 1570.7963267948965, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(19, 17), 6426.651371693521, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the provided program, let's break it down:

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function to find the volume of a cone.

### Program Code
```python
import math

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height

assert math.isclose(func_1(5, 12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(10, 15), 1570.7963267948965, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(19, 17), 6426.651371693521, rel_tol=0.001)
```

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Volume Formula**: The formula for the volume of a cone is:
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The function `func_1` implements this formula correctly.

2. **Test Cases**: The program tests the function for three different cases using `math.isclose` for floating point comparison, which is appropriate considering numerical precision.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Negative Values**: The program does not handle cases where the radius or height is negative. According to the physical definition of volume, both radius and height should be non-negative.
   - **Zero Values**: While a cone with a radius or height of zero would yield a volume of zero (which is mathematically correct), it may not be logically consistent in some contexts. However, from a mathematical standpoint, assigning zero to either parameter is appropriate.

### Example of Failure Case
If we test the program with a negative radius or height:
```python
func_1(-5, 12)  # This should not produce a valid volume.
```
In this case, the expected result should ideally be a handling of the improper input or an error, rather than returning a negative volume.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly adhere to the problem description because it fails to handle negative input values properly.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, and calculates the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. The function returns this volume. It does not handle cases where the inputs are negative or non-numeric, which could lead to runtime errors. However, if both inputs are valid, the function accurately computes and returns the volume of the cone, ensuring that the specification aligns with the mathematical definition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
