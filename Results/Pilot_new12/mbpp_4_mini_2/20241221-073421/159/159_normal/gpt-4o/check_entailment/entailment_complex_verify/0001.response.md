Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The program successfully implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, given by \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). 

1. The function `func_1(radius, height)` is defined correctly according to this formula, and the calculations for the volume align with the expected mathematical outputs for the given test cases.
2. The assertions provided in the code utilize `math.isclose` to compare the calculated volume with known correct values, which accounts for floating-point precision issues.
3. The annotations confirm that the radius and height are considered non-negative numbers before the function call, ensuring that the functionality adheres to the expected mathematical definitions.
4. The program does not handle invalid inputs but is assessed under the assumption that valid inputs (non-negative numbers) will be provided. Given the context, this is an acceptable assumption for correctness.

Overall, since the function behaves as specified and passes the provided tests, the program can be considered correct in accordance with the problem description.
