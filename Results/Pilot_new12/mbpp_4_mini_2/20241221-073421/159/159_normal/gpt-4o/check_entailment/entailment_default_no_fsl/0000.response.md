Correctness: **False**

The program calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \) correctly for valid inputs. However, it fails to handle cases where the inputs for `radius` and `height` are negative, which are possible edge cases that should be addressed. According to the problem description, the function should only accept non-negative values, but the program does not validate the inputs for this condition. 

For example, if we input `func_1(-5, 12)` or `func_1(5, -12)`, the function would still execute and produce a volume, which doesn't align with the expectation that both `radius` and `height` must be non-negative. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case as stipulated in the problem description.
