You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the volume of a cone.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1(5, 12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(10, 15), 1570.7963267948965, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(19, 17), 6426.651371693521, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by the formula:

\[ V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \]

Where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height of the cone. 

1. The function `func_1(radius, height)` is defined correctly according to the formula for the volume of a cone.
2. The provided assertions test the function using known values for the radius and height, and the expected results match the calculations.
3. The use of `math.isclose` ensures that floating point arithmetic errors will not lead to false negatives when checking the results.
4. No edge cases are overlooked since the formula holds for any non-negative values of radius and height. Even if either radius or height is zero, the formula correctly computes the volume as zero.

Since the function behaves as expected for the provided cases and follows the volume formula, no counterexamples can be found, thus validating the correctness of the program.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, and calculates the volume of a cone using the formula (1/3) * π * radius² * height. The function returns this volume. It does not handle cases where the inputs are negative or non-numeric, which could lead to runtime errors. However, if both inputs are valid, the function accurately computes and returns the volume of the cone, ensuring that the specification aligns with the mathematical definition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
