Explanation: The code presented correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is `(1/3) * π * radius² * height`. The function `func_1` takes two parameters - `radius` and `height` - and follows the formula accurately to compute the cone's volume. The output hints correctly point out that the function returns the volume based on valid inputs. However, it is important to note that there are no checks for negative or non-numeric inputs, which could potentially lead to incorrect results or runtime errors if such values are used. Yet, as per the given assumptions about the input being valid, the function computes the volume as intended.

Thus, we cannot identify any cases where the program does not work correctly based on the problem description provided.

Correctness: **True**.
