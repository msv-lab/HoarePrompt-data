To analyze the correctness of the provided program, let's break it down:

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function to find the volume of a cone.

### Program Code
```python
import math

def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height

assert math.isclose(func_1(5, 12), 314.15926535897927, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(10, 15), 1570.7963267948965, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1(19, 17), 6426.651371693521, rel_tol=0.001)
```

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Volume Formula**: The formula for the volume of a cone is:
   \[
   V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The function `func_1` implements this formula correctly.

2. **Test Cases**: The program tests the function for three different cases using `math.isclose` for floating point comparison, which is appropriate considering numerical precision.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - **Negative Values**: The program does not handle cases where the radius or height is negative. According to the physical definition of volume, both radius and height should be non-negative.
   - **Zero Values**: While a cone with a radius or height of zero would yield a volume of zero (which is mathematically correct), it may not be logically consistent in some contexts. However, from a mathematical standpoint, assigning zero to either parameter is appropriate.

### Example of Failure Case
If we test the program with a negative radius or height:
```python
func_1(-5, 12)  # This should not produce a valid volume.
```
In this case, the expected result should ideally be a handling of the improper input or an error, rather than returning a negative volume.

### Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the program does not correctly adhere to the problem description because it fails to handle negative input values properly.

Correctness: **False**.
