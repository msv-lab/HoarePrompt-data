Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \((1/3) \times \pi \times r^2 \times h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height of the cone. 

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are asserted to be non-negative numbers right before the function call. 
2. The formula used for calculating the volume is accurate and matches the mathematical definition of the volume of a cone.
3. The assertions included in the program validate that the volume calculations for given values return results that are accurate within a specified tolerance level, reinforcing that the calculations performed by the function are correct.

Additionally, the assumptions state that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors. Since the requirements specify the correct mathematical operation to determine the volume of a cone, the implementation meets the problem description fully. 

Hence, the function behaves correctly according to the problem statement under the stipulated assumptions.
