#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and tpl is a tuple of elements.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns a new list that combines the elements of 'lst' and the elements of 'tpl' converted to a list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that contains all the elements of `lst` followed by all the elements of `tpl` converted into a list. It effectively concatenates the two collections. The function handles the concatenation regardless of the contents of `lst` and `tpl`, including cases where `lst` or `tpl` might be empty. There are no additional edge cases or error handling present in the code.
