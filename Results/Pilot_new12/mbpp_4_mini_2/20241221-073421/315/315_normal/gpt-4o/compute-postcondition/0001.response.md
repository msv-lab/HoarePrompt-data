The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tpl`. `lst` is a list of elements, and `tpl` is a tuple of elements. After executing the function body, it returns a new list that combines the elements of `lst` with the elements of `tpl`, where the elements of `tpl` are converted to a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list that contains all elements of `lst` together with the elements of `tpl` converted to a list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that combines the elements of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` converted to a list.**
