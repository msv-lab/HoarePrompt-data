Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description, which requires adding the given tuple to the given list. The function `func_1(lst, tpl)` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and it returns a new list that combines the elements of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` by converting the tuple into a list using `list(tpl)` and concatenating it with `lst` using the `+` operator.

The assertions provided in the annotated program serve as test cases that demonstrate the expected behavior of the function, confirming that it meets the specified requirements. 

1. `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`.
2. `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`.
3. `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`.

All assertions are satisfied, indicating that `func_1` behaves as required by the problem description, successfully adding the elements of the tuple to the list.

Thus, the program follows the problem description without any issues, and we conclude that it is correct.
