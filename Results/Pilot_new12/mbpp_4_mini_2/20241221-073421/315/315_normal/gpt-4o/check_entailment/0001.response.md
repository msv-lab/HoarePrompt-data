Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1(lst, tpl)` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and it combines them by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it to the original list. 

The assertions provided in the program demonstrate the expected behavior for adding the elements of the tuple to the list:

1. `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` produces `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`
2. `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` produces `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`
3. `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` produces `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`

The logic used in the function correctly handles the combination of arbitrary lists and tuples, regardless of their lengths or types of elements (provided they are compatible types). 

I cannot think of any edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail to meet the requirements stated in the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program correctly implements the logic to add the elements of the tuple to the list in all potential cases.
