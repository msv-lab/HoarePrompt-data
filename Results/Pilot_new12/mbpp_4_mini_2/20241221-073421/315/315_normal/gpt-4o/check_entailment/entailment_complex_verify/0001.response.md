Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the function `func_1(lst, tpl)` which combines a list and a tuple by converting the tuple into a list and concatenating it to the original list. This behavior matches the problem description, which asks for a function to add the contents of a tuple to a list. 

The original assessment is accurate because:

1. The annotations clearly describe the expected input types and the output.
2. The assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected, consistently producing the correct results for the provided test cases.
3. The annotated code effectively explains that the function handles concatenation regardless of the content of the input list and tuple, which is in line with the assumptions stated that valid inputs will be provided.

As a result, the program meets the requirements and behaves as intended, reinforcing the correctness of the original assessment.
