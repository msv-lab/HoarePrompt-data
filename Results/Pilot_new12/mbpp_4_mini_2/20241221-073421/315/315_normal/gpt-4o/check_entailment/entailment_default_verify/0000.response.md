Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` meets the problem description of adding a tuple to a list. The program correctly concatenates the list and the converted tuple using the expression `lst + list(tpl)`. The assertion tests confirm that the program behaves as expected for various inputs. 

The output hints reiterate that the function handles both empty and non-empty cases for the inputs without any issues, which is aligned with the initial assessment that all potential inputs will be valid and correctly processed. Therefore, the function's implementation correctly adheres to the specifications given in the problem description, confirming the correctness of the program as initially assessed.
