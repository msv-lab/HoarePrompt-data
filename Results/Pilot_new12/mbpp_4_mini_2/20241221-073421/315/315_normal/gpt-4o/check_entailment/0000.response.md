Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly adds the given tuple to the provided list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the input list. The test cases provided validate that it works as expected for the specified inputs. The function should handle all input cases based on the problem description, thus confirming its correctness. 

The operation `lst + list(tpl)` efficiently combines the list with the elements of the tuple, ensuring that no edge cases lead to incorrect output, such as empty lists or tuples. Therefore, all potential cases in line with the problem description are handled correctly.
