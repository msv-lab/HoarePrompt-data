Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code correctly implements the function to add the elements of a given tuple to the end of a given list. The function concatenates the two collections using the `+` operator, which works as intended for valid lists and tuples. The output hints indicate that the function handles various cases, including empty lists or tuples. Since the problem description requires appending the elements of a tuple to a list, which the code does effectively by converting the tuple to a list, the function meets the requirements. Additionally, the assert statements provided confirm that the function returns the expected output for the given test cases. There are no edge cases presented that the code fails to handle according to the problem description.
