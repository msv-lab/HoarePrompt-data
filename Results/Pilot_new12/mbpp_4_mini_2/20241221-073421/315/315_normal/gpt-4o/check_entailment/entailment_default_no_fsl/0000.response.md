Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple and correctly concatenates them into a new list. The provided code and output hints confirm that the function handles all cases, including when either the list or the tuple is empty. As per the assertions given, the function has passed all the provided test cases. 

During concatenation, both collections remain intact, and the function meets the problem description's requirements for each tested scenario. Since there are no identified edge cases or additional requirements that the code fails to handle, the conclusion is that the function is correct.
