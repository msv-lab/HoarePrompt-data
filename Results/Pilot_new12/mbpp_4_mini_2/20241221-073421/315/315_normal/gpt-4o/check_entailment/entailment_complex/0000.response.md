The annotated program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`) as input, adds the elements of the tuple to the list, and returns a new list containing the combined elements.

Here's how it meets the problem description:

1. **Acceptance of Input Types**: The function accepts two parameters: a list and a tuple, as specified in the problem description. There are no additional type checks required since we assume the inputs will always be valid (a list and a tuple).

2. **Concatenation of Elements**: The program uses the expression `lst + list(tpl)` to concatenate the elements of the list and the tuple. This expression effectively converts the tuple into a list and appends its elements to the original list.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the new list that combines the elements of `lst` and those converted from `tpl`, which aligns with the requirement to "add the given tuple to the given list."

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function handles cases where either `lst` or `tpl` might be empty (e.g., if `lst` is `[]` and `tpl` is `(1, 2)`, it will simply return `[1, 2]`, and if `lst` is `[3]` and `tpl` is `()`, it will return `[3]`).

Given these points, the function strictly adheres to the problem description and does not miss any edge cases regarding valid input types or empty collections.

Overall, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
