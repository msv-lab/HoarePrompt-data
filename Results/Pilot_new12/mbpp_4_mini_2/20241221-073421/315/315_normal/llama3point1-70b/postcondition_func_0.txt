The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`. It returns a new list that combines the elements of `input_list` with those of `input_tuple`, converted into a list. If `input_list` is empty, the result will be a list containing only the elements of `input_tuple`. If `input_tuple` is empty, the result will simply be `input_list`. The function does not account for the types of elements within the list or tuple, so if they are not compatible for concatenation, a TypeError may occur. Thus, while the function primarily aims to concatenate these two data structures, it lacks explicit error handling for type mismatches and does not validate whether the input variables conform to their expected types.
