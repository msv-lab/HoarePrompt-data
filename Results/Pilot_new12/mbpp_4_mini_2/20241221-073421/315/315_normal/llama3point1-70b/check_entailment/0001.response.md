Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`). It correctly converts the tuple to a list and concatenates it with the original list. The function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement:

1. If `input_list` is empty and `input_tuple` is non-empty, it will return a list containing all elements from the tuple.
2. If `input_list` is non-empty and `input_tuple` is empty, it will return the original list.
3. If both `input_list` and `input_tuple` are empty, it will return an empty list.
4. If both `input_list` and `input_tuple` contain elements, it will concatenate the elements from both correctly.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential inputs, it is correct.
