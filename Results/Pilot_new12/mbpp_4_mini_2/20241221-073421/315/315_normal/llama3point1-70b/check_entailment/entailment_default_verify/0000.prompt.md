You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and correctly combines them by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it with the input list. This logic properly follows the problem description for all potential cases, including:

1. When the tuple is empty, it will simply return the original list.
2. When the list is empty, it will return a list containing the elements of the tuple.
3. For non-empty inputs, it correctly appends all elements of the tuple to the list.
4. The types of the elements in the tuple do not affect the output as the conversion is straightforward.

Therefore, I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`. It returns a new list that combines the elements of `input_list` with those of `input_tuple`, converted into a list. If `input_list` is empty, the result will be a list containing only the elements of `input_tuple`. If `input_tuple` is empty, the result will simply be `input_list`. The function does not account for the types of elements within the list or tuple, so if they are not compatible for concatenation, a TypeError may occur. Thus, while the function primarily aims to concatenate these two data structures, it lacks explicit error handling for type mismatches and does not validate whether the input variables conform to their expected types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
