Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and correctly combines them by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it with the input list. This logic properly follows the problem description for all potential cases, including:

1. When the tuple is empty, it will simply return the original list.
2. When the list is empty, it will return a list containing the elements of the tuple.
3. For non-empty inputs, it correctly appends all elements of the tuple to the list.
4. The types of the elements in the tuple do not affect the output as the conversion is straightforward.

Therefore, I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description.
