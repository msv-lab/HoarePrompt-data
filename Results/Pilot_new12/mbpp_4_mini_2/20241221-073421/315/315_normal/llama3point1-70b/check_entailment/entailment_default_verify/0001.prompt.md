You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list (`input_list`) and a tuple (`input_tuple`). It correctly converts the tuple to a list and concatenates it with the original list. The function handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement:

1. If `input_list` is empty and `input_tuple` is non-empty, it will return a list containing all elements from the tuple.
2. If `input_list` is non-empty and `input_tuple` is empty, it will return the original list.
3. If both `input_list` and `input_tuple` are empty, it will return an empty list.
4. If both `input_list` and `input_tuple` contain elements, it will concatenate the elements from both correctly.

Since the function behaves as expected for all potential inputs, it is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`. It returns a new list that combines the elements of `input_list` with those of `input_tuple`, converted into a list. If `input_list` is empty, the result will be a list containing only the elements of `input_tuple`. If `input_tuple` is empty, the result will simply be `input_list`. The function does not account for the types of elements within the list or tuple, so if they are not compatible for concatenation, a TypeError may occur. Thus, while the function primarily aims to concatenate these two data structures, it lacks explicit error handling for type mismatches and does not validate whether the input variables conform to their expected types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
