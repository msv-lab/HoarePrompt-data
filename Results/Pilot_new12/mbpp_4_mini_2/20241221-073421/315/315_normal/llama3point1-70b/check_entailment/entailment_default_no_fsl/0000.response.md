Correctness: **False**

The code does not work correctly for every potential case because it lacks explicit error handling for cases where the inputs are not of the expected types. While the problem description specifies that a tuple should be added to a list, it does not account for type mismatches or provide any type validation. For instance, if a user mistakenly passes in a tuple that contains an element that is not compatible with the list (e.g., a function or a complex object), a TypeError could occur. The output hints further underline that the function does not handle potential type mismatches, which would lead to incorrect functionality in those scenarios. 

Therefore, since the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case due to the lack of error handling and input validation, the correctness is marked as false.
