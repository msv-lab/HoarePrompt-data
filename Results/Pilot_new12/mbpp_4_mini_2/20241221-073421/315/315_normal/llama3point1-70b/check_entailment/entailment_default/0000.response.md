The given program follows the problem description, which states that the function should add the elements of a provided tuple to a given list. 

The program:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
```

executes the task as expected by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it with the given list. 

Output hints confirm that it correctly handles various scenarios:
- If `input_list` is empty, the result will only include elements from `input_tuple`.
- If `input_tuple` is empty, the result will simply be `input_list`.

Both of these cases align with typical list and tuple behaviors in Python. Furthermore, while it does not perform explicit type checks for the elements within the list or tuple, the description assumes valid input. 

Since the function will provide the correct output for all valid inputs and does not explicitly state any constraints that would lead to incorrect outcomes, we conclude that it works properly under the described conditions.

Correctness: **True**.
