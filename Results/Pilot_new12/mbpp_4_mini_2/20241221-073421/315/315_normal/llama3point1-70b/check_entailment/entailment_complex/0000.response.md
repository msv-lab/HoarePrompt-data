Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it does not modify the original `input_list` by adding the elements of the `input_tuple` to it. Instead, it returns a new list that is the result of concatenating `input_list` and the converted `input_tuple`. The problem description specifies the function must add the elements of the tuple to the existing list, which implies modifying the list in place. 

Correct behavior according to the problem description would involve appending each element of `input_tuple` to `input_list`, rather than creating and returning a new list. Therefore, since the program's implementation deviates from the stated requirements, it is deemed incorrect.
