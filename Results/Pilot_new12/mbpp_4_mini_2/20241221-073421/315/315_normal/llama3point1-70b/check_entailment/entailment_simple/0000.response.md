Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem specifically asks for a function that adds a given tuple to a given list. However, the program is written to return a new list that is the result of concatenating the input list and a converted version of the input tuple, rather than modifying the existing list in-place.

In Python, to "add" elements from a tuple to a list typically implies modifying the list by extending it with the elements from the tuple. The program does not do this; instead, it returns a new list without altering the original `input_list`.

Hereâ€™s a correct implementation that would meet the requirement:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.extend(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```

This implementation modifies `input_list` in place by adding the elements from `input_tuple`, which aligns with the problem statement asking to "add the given tuple to the given list." Thus, the initial program fails to correctly fulfill the problem requirements.
