The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `input_list` and `input_tuple`. `input_list` is a list, and `input_tuple` is a tuple. The function returns a list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and a new list created from the elements of `input_tuple`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list and a tuple, and return a single list that merges the two inputs together. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `input_list` and a tuple `input_tuple`, and returns a list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and the elements of `input_tuple` converted to a list.**
