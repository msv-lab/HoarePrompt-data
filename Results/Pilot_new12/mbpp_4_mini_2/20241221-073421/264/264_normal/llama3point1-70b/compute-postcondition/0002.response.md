Functionality: **The function accepts a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and returns its equivalent in radians by multiplying `deg` by `math.pi` and dividing by 180. It effectively performs the conversion from degrees to radians without handling any potential edge cases, such as ensuring that `deg` is a valid numeric type. Therefore, passing non-numeric values could lead to a runtime error. After execution, the user can expect the returned value to be the radian equivalent of the input degree value.**
