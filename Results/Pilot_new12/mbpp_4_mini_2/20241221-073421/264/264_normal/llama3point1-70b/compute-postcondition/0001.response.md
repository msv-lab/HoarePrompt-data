The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `deg`. `deg` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. The function returns the result of converting the angle in degrees (`deg`) to radians by calculating `deg` multiplied by `math.pi` and divided by 180. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and return its equivalent in radians. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a numeric value deg representing an angle in degrees and returns its equivalent in radians.**
