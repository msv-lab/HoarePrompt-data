#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns the result of converting the angle in degrees (deg) to radians by calculating deg multiplied by math.pi and divided by 180.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and returns its equivalent in radians by multiplying `deg` by `math.pi` and dividing by 180. It effectively performs the conversion from degrees to radians without handling any potential edge cases, such as ensuring that `deg` is a valid numeric type. Therefore, passing non-numeric values could lead to a runtime error. After execution, the user can expect the returned value to be the radian equivalent of the input degree value.
