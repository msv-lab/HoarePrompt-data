The program effectively implements the formula to convert degrees to radians, which is consistent with the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a numeric value and performs the conversion accurately, returning the expected output based on the input degree value. 

The original assessment states that the program is correct, asserting that it handles all valid inputs properly. However, the output hints mention that the function does not account for non-numeric values, which suggests that while the function works correctly for valid inputs (assuming a numeric type), there might be potential runtime errors with invalid inputs. Despite this, the assessment notes that we assume valid input and does not lead to incorrect outputs for the expected numeric input cases.

Since the problem description specifically asks for conversion of degrees to radians and the program accomplishes this correctly as specified, we conclude that the program adheres to its requirements, and thus, the original assessment accurately reflects the correctness based on the provided context.

Final: **True**
