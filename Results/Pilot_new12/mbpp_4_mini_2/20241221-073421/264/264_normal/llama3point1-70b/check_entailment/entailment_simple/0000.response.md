Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians, which is explicitly stated in the problem description. The function `func_1(deg)` takes a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and returns the result of the conversion using the formula:

\[
\text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}
\]

The program adheres to the requirements because it correctly applies the conversion formula and returns the appropriate result. Since the problem description specifies preparing a function that converts degrees to radians, and the function precisely accomplishes that, there are no discrepancies or omitted cases within the defined constraints of valid input. Thus, we conclude that the program is correct.
