Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic needed to convert degrees to radians by multiplying the input angle in degrees (`deg`) by `math.pi` and dividing by 180. The provided annotations clearly outline the purpose of the function and explain the mathematical conversion that is taking place.

While the implementation does not check for edge cases involving the validity of the input type (assuming it will always be a valid numeric value), according to the problem description, the requirement is solely to convert degrees to radians. The function meets this requirement as per the assumption that valid input will be provided.

Therefore, since the function performs the required conversion accurately and adheres to the specifications outlined in the problem description, it is deemed correct.
