Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This conversion is mathematically sound and accurately handles any numerical input representing degrees.

Specifically:
- For a full circle (360 degrees), the output should be \( 2\pi \) radians, which the program correctly computes.
- For 90 degrees, the output should be \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians, also handled correctly by the program.
- Negative angles and non-integer inputs are also managed as the program relies on standard mathematical operations.

No edge cases are overlooked, and all inputs are accurately processed by the function, thus confirming the correctness of the implementation.
