You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This conversion is mathematically sound and accurately handles any numerical input representing degrees.

Specifically:
- For a full circle (360 degrees), the output should be \( 2\pi \) radians, which the program correctly computes.
- For 90 degrees, the output should be \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians, also handled correctly by the program.
- Negative angles and non-integer inputs are also managed as the program relies on standard mathematical operations.

No edge cases are overlooked, and all inputs are accurately processed by the function, thus confirming the correctness of the implementation.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: deg is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    #The program returns the result of converting the angle in degrees (deg) to radians by calculating deg multiplied by math.pi and divided by 180.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and returns its equivalent in radians by multiplying `deg` by `math.pi` and dividing by 180. It effectively performs the conversion from degrees to radians without handling any potential edge cases, such as ensuring that `deg` is a valid numeric type. Therefore, passing non-numeric values could lead to a runtime error. After execution, the user can expect the returned value to be the radian equivalent of the input degree value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
