You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This conversion is mathematically sound and accurately handles any numerical input representing degrees.

Specifically:
- For a full circle (360 degrees), the output should be \( 2\pi \) radians, which the program correctly computes.
- For 90 degrees, the output should be \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians, also handled correctly by the program.
- Negative angles and non-integer inputs are also managed as the program relies on standard mathematical operations.

No edge cases are overlooked, and all inputs are accurately processed by the function, thus confirming the correctness of the implementation.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a numeric value `deg` representing an angle in degrees and returns its equivalent in radians by multiplying `deg` by `math.pi` and dividing by 180. It effectively performs the conversion from degrees to radians without handling any potential edge cases, such as ensuring that `deg` is a valid numeric type. Therefore, passing non-numeric values could lead to a runtime error. After execution, the user can expect the returned value to be the radian equivalent of the input degree value.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
