Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code appears to follow the intended purpose of converting degrees to radians by using the formula `deg * math.pi / 180`. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle potential edge cases, such as accepting non-numeric values. If a non-numeric value (e.g., a string) is passed into the function, it will result in a runtime error. Since the requirement is to ensure the program functions correctly for every potential case, and it fails to do so for non-numeric inputs, the correctness cannot be affirmed. Hence, the function is incorrect.
