Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program successfully implements the expected functionality of converting degrees to radians using the correct formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The annotated version aligns with this logic by confirming that the input `deg` is properly processed as a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. The program handles valid input effectively and produces the correct output for all cases, meeting the problem description requirements. There are no edge cases addressed in the annotations that indicate potential failures in conversion. Thus, the program's correctness is upheld.
