Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula holds true for all valid inputs, including positive, negative, and zero degree values. There are no edge cases that would cause the function to misbehave, as it applies the mathematical conversion universally. Thus, for every input, the program provides the correct output as expected by the problem description.
