Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness for the program is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotations. The function `func_1` correctly implements the mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians, as supported by the annotations. The annotated code clarifies that `deg` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees and confirms that the function returns the correct value by multiplying `deg` by `math.pi` and dividing by 180. This behavior aligns with the expected results for specific test cases outlined in the original assessment.

Moreover, the assumptions of valid input reinforce the validity of this assessment since we are considering the function to handle any numeric values representing degrees appropriately. Thus, the function satisfies the problem's requirements without any overlooked edge cases under the stated input conditions.
