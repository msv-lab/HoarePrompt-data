Correctness: **False**

The provided program aims to convert degrees to radians, which aligns with the problem description. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle potential edge cases, such as ensuring that the input `deg` is a valid numeric type. This could lead to a runtime error if non-numeric values are passed (e.g., strings, `None`, etc.). Since the function could fail under certain conditions, it does not fulfill the requirement of working correctly for every potential case. Therefore, the output from the hints confirms that the program is incomplete, resulting in an overall conclusion that it is not correct in all scenarios.
