Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the assertions are executed before the definition of the function `func_1`, leading to a `NameError` since the function is not defined at the time the assertions are checked. Even though the function's logic for converting degrees to radians is correct, the incorrect ordering of the code renders the program non-functional as written. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement for correctness based on the problem description.
