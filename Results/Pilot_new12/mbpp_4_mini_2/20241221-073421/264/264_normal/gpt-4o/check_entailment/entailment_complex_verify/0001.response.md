Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate as it correctly identifies that the function `func_1` implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the appropriate formula. The provided test cases validate that the function performs correctly for several common angles, including `0`, `90`, `60`, `120`, and edge cases like `-180` and `360` have also been examined and verified using the conversion formula. 

The annotations reinforce the understanding that the function accepts numeric inputs and provides a clear description of how the conversion is made. While the annotated version mentions that the function does not handle edge cases related to non-numeric inputs or extreme values, it also clarifies that the program is assumed to receive valid inputs. Therefore, given the problem description and annotations, the overall behavior aligns with the requirements, confirming the correctness of the program.
