You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert degrees to radians.
Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966
assert func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976
assert func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953

def func_1(degrees):
    return degrees * (math.pi / 180)


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the provided program is correct in converting degrees to radians, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and the given test cases.

The conversion of degrees to radians is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left( \frac{\pi}{180} \right) \]

The program defines the function `func_1` which implements the conversion correctly and includes several assertions that test the function with specific degree values.

Let's break down the assertions:
- `func_1(90)` should return approximately `1.5707963267948966`, which is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).
- `func_1(60)` should return approximately `1.0471975511965976`, which is \(\frac{\pi}{3}\).
- `func_1(120)` should return approximately `2.0943951023931953`, which is \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\).

These assertions test specific angles, but we need to ensure that the function works for all potential edge cases and inputs. 

We will examine at least one potential edge case:
- If we test the function with `0` degrees, it should return `0` radians. Let's check that:
  
```python
assert func_1(0) == 0
```

When we calculate it:
```python
func_1(0) = 0 * (math.pi / 180) = 0
```

This case correctly returns `0`, confirming that the function handles the conversion at the lower boundary.

Let’s consider another edge case:
- If we test the function with `-180` degrees, it should return `-π` radians. Let's check that:
  
```python
assert func_1(-180) == -math.pi
```

When calculated:
```python
func_1(-180) = -180 * (math.pi / 180) = -π
```

This case also correctly returns `-π`, demonstrating the function can handle negative inputs.

Next, let's test with `360` degrees:
- It should return `2π` radians:
  
```python
assert func_1(360) == 2 * math.pi
```

When calculated:
```python
func_1(360) = 360 * (math.pi / 180) = 2π
```

This also holds true.

The function seems to perform correctly for both positive and negative degree values, including key edge cases like `0`, `360`, and negative degrees.

Therefore, since the function correctly converts degrees to radians and passes the shown tests and potential edge cases, I conclude that the program meets the specified problem requirements.

Correctness: **True** 

The code is correct as it successfully handles the conversion for both positive and negative angles, including edge cases like `0`, `180`, and `360` degrees, returning the expected radian values based on the conversion formula.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a numeric value representing an angle in degrees and returns its equivalent in radians. Specifically, it performs the conversion by multiplying the input degrees by the factor of π/180. The function does not handle any edge cases related to non-numeric inputs or values outside the typical range for angles, such as NaN, infinity, or extremely large values, which could lead to inaccuracies in practical applications. After executing, the program's state will reflect this conversion, returning the angle in radians as a floating-point number.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
