Final: **False**

While the original assessment correctly identified the function’s implementation of the conversion formula and its handling of several positive and negative angles, it overlooked the important aspect highlighted in the output hints regarding the absence of handling for non-numeric inputs and extreme values. The hints indicated that the function may produce inaccuracies or errors if it receives NaN, infinity, or other invalid numeric types. Therefore, despite the function performing well within the tested range of valid inputs, the lack of error handling for potential edge cases means the program cannot be considered fully correct according to the broader expectations of robustness. Thus, it is more reflective of the code’s functionality to conclude that the program does not meet the problem description in its entirety.
