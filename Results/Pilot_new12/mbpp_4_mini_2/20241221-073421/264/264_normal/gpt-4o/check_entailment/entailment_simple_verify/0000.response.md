Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The assertion statements that test the `func_1` function are executed before the function itself is defined, leading to a `NameError` when the assertions attempt to call `func_1`. Therefore, regardless of the correctness of the `func_1` function's implementation for converting degrees to radians, the program does not operate correctly due to the order of definitions. The annotations describe the function correctly, but they cannot change the fact that the assertions will fail before the function is available, making the program incorrect in its current form.
