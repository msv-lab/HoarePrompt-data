Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate as it correctly identifies that the function `func_1` implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the proper formula. The annotated code supports the conclusion by clarifying the expected state of inputs and outputs. 

The function has been tested against meaningful assertions that check conversion for common angles, and additional edge cases like `0`, `-180`, and `360` degrees have been considered, which further validates the correctness of the program. All results align with the mathematical expectations of the conversion formula, meeting the problem description fully. Therefore, the assessment that the program is correct stands validated.
