Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is defined after the assertions, meaning the test cases `assert func_1(90)`, `assert func_1(60)`, and `assert func_1(120)` will fail because `func_1` has not been defined at the time the assertions are executed. This will lead to a `NameError`. Thus, even if the function itself is logically sound for converting degrees to radians, it is incorrect in its current form due to the ordering of code.
