Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to convert degrees to radians. Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` is defined to accept a single parameter `degrees`, which represents an angle in degrees. This conforms to the problem requirement.

2. **Conversion Logic**: The return statement in the function executes the mathematical conversion from degrees to radians by multiplying the input `degrees` by the factor \( \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula is accurate for converting degrees to radians.

3. **Assertions for Testing**: The assertions that check the output of `func_1` demonstrate that the function produces the expected results for specific degrees, confirming its correctness for those test cases:
   - `func_1(90)` evaluates to approximately 1.5708, which is indeed \( \frac{\pi}{2} \) radians.
   - `func_1(60)` returns approximately 1.0472, corresponding to \( \frac{\pi}{3} \) radians.
   - `func_1(120)` results in approximately 2.0944, equal to \( \frac{2\pi}{3} \) radians.

4. **Overall Functionality**: The function handles valid numeric inputs, and the provided annotations reinforce that the program is designed to perform the task outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the alignment of the code's functionality with the problem description requirements and the correctness of the conversion formula used, the program is verified as correct.
