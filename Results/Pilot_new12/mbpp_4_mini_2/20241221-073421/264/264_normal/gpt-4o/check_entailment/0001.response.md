To determine if the provided program is correct in converting degrees to radians, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and the given test cases.

The conversion of degrees to radians is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left( \frac{\pi}{180} \right) \]

The program defines the function `func_1` which implements the conversion correctly and includes several assertions that test the function with specific degree values.

Let's break down the assertions:
- `func_1(90)` should return approximately `1.5707963267948966`, which is \(\frac{\pi}{2}\).
- `func_1(60)` should return approximately `1.0471975511965976`, which is \(\frac{\pi}{3}\).
- `func_1(120)` should return approximately `2.0943951023931953`, which is \(\frac{2\pi}{3}\).

These assertions test specific angles, but we need to ensure that the function works for all potential edge cases and inputs. 

We will examine at least one potential edge case:
- If we test the function with `0` degrees, it should return `0` radians. Let's check that:
  
```python
assert func_1(0) == 0
```

When we calculate it:
```python
func_1(0) = 0 * (math.pi / 180) = 0
```

This case correctly returns `0`, confirming that the function handles the conversion at the lower boundary.

Let’s consider another edge case:
- If we test the function with `-180` degrees, it should return `-π` radians. Let's check that:
  
```python
assert func_1(-180) == -math.pi
```

When calculated:
```python
func_1(-180) = -180 * (math.pi / 180) = -π
```

This case also correctly returns `-π`, demonstrating the function can handle negative inputs.

Next, let's test with `360` degrees:
- It should return `2π` radians:
  
```python
assert func_1(360) == 2 * math.pi
```

When calculated:
```python
func_1(360) = 360 * (math.pi / 180) = 2π
```

This also holds true.

The function seems to perform correctly for both positive and negative degree values, including key edge cases like `0`, `360`, and negative degrees.

Therefore, since the function correctly converts degrees to radians and passes the shown tests and potential edge cases, I conclude that the program meets the specified problem requirements.

Correctness: **True** 

The code is correct as it successfully handles the conversion for both positive and negative angles, including edge cases like `0`, `180`, and `360` degrees, returning the expected radian values based on the conversion formula.
