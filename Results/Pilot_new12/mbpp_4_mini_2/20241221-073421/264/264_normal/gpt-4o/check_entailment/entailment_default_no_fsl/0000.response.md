Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle edge cases related to non-numeric inputs or values outside the typical range for angles, such as NaN, infinity, or extremely large numeric values. For example, if the function `func_1` is called with a string input like `"90"`, it will raise a TypeError, which is not addressed in the code. Additionally, if it is called with special floating-point values like `float('nan')` or `float('inf')`, the output may be invalid or misleading. Since the program does not handle these potential cases, it cannot be considered correct.
