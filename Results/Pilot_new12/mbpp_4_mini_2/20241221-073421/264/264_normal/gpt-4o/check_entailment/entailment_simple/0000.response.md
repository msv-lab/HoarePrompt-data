Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to convert degrees to radians. 

Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1(degrees)` takes a numeric input representing an angle in degrees. The problem description allows for such input to be valid.

2. **Conversion Logic**: The formula used in the function `return degrees * (math.pi / 180)` is accurate for converting degrees to radians. This conversion is based on the mathematical relationship that 180 degrees is equivalent to π radians.

3. **Assertions for Verification**: The program tests the function with three assertions:
   - `func_1(90) == 1.5707963267948966` (which is π/2 in radians)
   - `func_1(60) == 1.0471975511965976` (which is π/3 in radians)
   - `func_1(120) == 2.0943951023931953` (which is 2π/3 in radians)
   
   All these assertions validate that the function produces the expected outcomes for the angles provided.

Since the function adheres strictly to the stated purpose of converting degrees to radians and produces correct results for the tested cases, it is assuredly correct as per the problem description.
