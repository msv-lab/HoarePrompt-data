Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the ordering of statements in the program causes a `NameError`. The function `func_1` is referenced in the assertions before it is defined, which means that these assertions will fail when executed, regardless of whether `func_1` itself is logically correct. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description as it cannot function correctly as written. The annotated version confirms that the function does correctly compute radians; however, it cannot be executed due to the placement of the assertions. Thus, the program is deemed incorrect in its current form.
