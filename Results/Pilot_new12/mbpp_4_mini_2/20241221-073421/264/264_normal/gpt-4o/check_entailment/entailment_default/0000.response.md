Explanation: The code successfully converts degrees to radians using the formula `radians = degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. The output hints align with the code implementation, indicating that the function `func_1` takes a numeric input representing an angle in degrees and produces its equivalent in radians without any apparent edge case issues with the given assumptions. As the hints state, the program does not handle non-numeric inputs, NaN, or infinity, but since we assume the input will always be valid as specified in the task, we consider the function to operate correctly. Therefore, all expected cases in the problem description are satisfied.

Correctness: **True**.
