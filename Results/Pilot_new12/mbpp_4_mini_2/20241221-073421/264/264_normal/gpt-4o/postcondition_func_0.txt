The function `func_1` accepts a numeric value representing an angle in degrees and returns its equivalent in radians. Specifically, it performs the conversion by multiplying the input degrees by the factor of Ï€/180. The function does not handle any edge cases related to non-numeric inputs or values outside the typical range for angles, such as NaN, infinity, or extremely large values, which could lead to inaccuracies in practical applications. After executing, the program's state will reflect this conversion, returning the angle in radians as a floating-point number.
