The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `degrees`. `degrees` is a numeric value representing an angle in degrees. The function returns the angle in radians, which is calculated by multiplying `degrees` by (math.pi / 180). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a numeric value `degrees` and return its equivalent in radians. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter degrees, returns the angle in radians calculated from degrees.**
