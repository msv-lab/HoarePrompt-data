The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. All three parameters are positive floats, where `base` represents the area of the triangular base, `height` represents the height of the triangular base, and `length` represents the length of the prism. The function calculates and returns the volume of the prism using the formula \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept positive float values for `base`, `height`, and `length`, and return the calculated volume of the prism based on these values.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters base, height, and length (all positive floats), and returns the volume of a prism calculated as 0.5 * base * height * length.**
