`base_area` is assigned the value of 0.5 multiplied by `base` and `height`. Since `base` and `height` are both positive floats, `base_area` will be a positive float representing the area of the triangular base. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`base` is a positive float representing the area of the triangular base, `height` is a positive float representing the height of the triangular base, `length` is a positive float representing the length of the prism, and `base_area` is equal to 0.5 * `base` * `height`.**
