Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the provided problem description. It does this by first calculating the area of the triangular base using the formula \( \text{Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \) and then multiplying that area by the length of the prism to obtain the volume, using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length} \).

The assertions provided test various cases:

1. \( \text{func_1}(10, 8, 6) \) calculates: 
   - Base Area = \( 0.5 \times 10 \times 8 = 40 \)
   - Volume = \( 40 \times 6 = 240 \) (Correct)

2. \( \text{func_1}(3, 2, 2) \) calculates: 
   - Base Area = \( 0.5 \times 3 \times 2 = 3 \)
   - Volume = \( 3 \times 2 = 6 \) (Correct)

3. \( \text{func_1}(1, 2, 1) \) calculates: 
   - Base Area = \( 0.5 \times 1 \times 2 = 1 \)
   - Volume = \( 1 \times 1 = 1 \) (Correct)

Given the provided tests and the structure of the function, it handles the calculation correctly for typical use cases of calculating the volume of a triangular prism. I could not find any potential inputs or edge cases where this code would fail given the problem requirements, solidifying the correctness of the implementation.
