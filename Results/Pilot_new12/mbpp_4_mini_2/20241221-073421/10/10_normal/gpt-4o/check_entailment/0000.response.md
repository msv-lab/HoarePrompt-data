Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length} \). It computes the base area of the triangle with the formula \( \text{Base Area} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \). The provided test assertions confirm that it produces correct results for the cases given: for an input of (10, 8, 6), it correctly computes a volume of 240; for (3, 2, 2), it gives 6; and for (1, 2, 1), it yields 1. All inputs are properly handled, including those leading to zero or positive outputs, and there's no potential case where the function produces incorrect results. Thus, the implementation meets the problem description's requirements.
