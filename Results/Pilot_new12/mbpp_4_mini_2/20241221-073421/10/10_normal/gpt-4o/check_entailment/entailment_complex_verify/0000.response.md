Final: **False**

Reasoning: While the function `func_1` implements the volume calculation correctly based on the provided mathematical formula, the annotations indicate that it does not handle cases where the inputs might be zero or negative, which could lead to incorrect results or exceptions. Since the problem description does not specify that all input values will be positive and valid, the lack of handling for potentially invalid input means the function does not fully meet the requirements of robustness. As a result, the original assessment of correctness as **True** is not accurate.
