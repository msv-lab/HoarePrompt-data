Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to calculate the volume of a triangular prism as specified in the problem description. 

Here's the explanation of why it is correct:

1. The formula used to calculate the volume of a triangular prism is correct: 
   - For a triangular prism, the volume is calculated using the formula: 
     \[
     \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length}
     \]
     where the base area of a triangle is given by:
     \[
     \text{Base Area} = 0.5 \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}
     \]
   - Thus, the program computes volume as:
     \[
     \text{Volume} = 0.5 \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} \times \text{Length}
     \]

2. The program's implementation matches the description:
   - The `func_1` function accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, all of which are positive floats as stated in the annotations.
   - The assertions provided further confirm that the function behaves correctly for specific input cases, yielding the expected volume values.

3. It is assumed, as per the instruction, that the input values will always be valid and positive. Therefore, the function does not need to handle cases where the inputs might be zero or negative. Under this assumption, the function will always yield a correct positive float representing the volume of the prism.

In summary, the program meets its requirements by implementing the correct mathematical formula to compute the volume of a triangular prism and validating that it works as expected through assertions. Thus, it adheres to the problem description.
