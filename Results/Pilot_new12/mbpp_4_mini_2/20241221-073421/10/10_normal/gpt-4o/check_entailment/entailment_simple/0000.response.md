Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution to the problem of calculating the volume of a triangular prism. The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. 

1. **Base Area Calculation**: The area of the triangular base is calculated using the formula `0.5 * base * height`, which is standard for calculating the area of a triangle.
2. **Volume Calculation**: The volume of the prism is then computed by multiplying the area of the base by the length of the prism, following the formula `volume = base_area * length`.

The test assertions included are:
- `func_1(10, 8, 6)` returns 240, which is consistent with the calculation \(0.5 * 10 * 8 * 6 = 240\).
- `func_1(3, 2, 2)` returns 6, which aligns with \(0.5 * 3 * 2 * 2 = 6\).
- `func_1(1, 2, 1)` returns 1, as \(0.5 * 1 * 2 * 1 = 1\).

Since the function correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism for positive floats as input, and meets the requirements stated in the problem description, the program is marked correct. Thus, it adheres to the expected output for valid inputs as per the problem description.
