#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a positive float representing the base of the triangular prism, h is a positive float representing the height of the triangular face, and l is a positive float representing the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as (base of the triangular face 'b' multiplied by height 'h' divided by 2) multiplied by the length of the prism 'l'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`, which are positive floats representing the base, height, and length of a triangular prism, respectively. It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \((b \times h / 2) \times l\). However, the function assumes that all inputs are valid positive floats and does not handle cases where the inputs might be zero or negative, nor does it check for non-float inputs. Therefore, while it serves its intended purpose of calculating the volume, it lacks input validation to ensure that the inputs conform to the expected types and positive constraints.
