Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism based on the given problem description. 

Here's a breakdown of how it follows the requirements:

1. **Formula for Volume**: The volume \( V \) of a triangular prism is calculated using the formula:
   \[
   V = \text{Area of the base} \times \text{Length}
   \]
   The area of a triangular base can be calculated as:
   \[
   \text{Area} = \frac{\text{base} \times \text{height}}{2}
   \]
   Thus, the complete formula for the volume of a triangular prism is:
   \[
   V = \left(\frac{b \times h}{2}\right) \times l
   \]
   where \( b \) is the base, \( h \) is the height, and \( l \) is the length of the prism.

2. **Implementation**: The function `func_1(b, h, l)` implements this formula exactly:
   - It takes the parameters \( b \), \( h \), and \( l \) which represent the base, height, and length respectively.
   - It returns the calculated volume using the formula.

3. **Input Assumptions**: The problem description indicates that we can assume the inputs are valid (positive floats). Since the function is designed to work under these assumptions, it will yield the correct volume calculation.

In conclusion, since the program correctly implements the required calculation according to the problem description, it is deemed correct.
