You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the volume of a triangular prism.
Program:
```
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \]

where:
- `b` is the base of the triangular base of the prism,
- `h` is the height of the triangular base,
- `l` is the length (or depth) of the prism.

The expression `b * h / 2 * l` evaluates to the volume accurately for all valid input values of `b`, `h`, and `l`, including edge cases like zero values. 

1. If any of the dimensions (`b`, `h`, `l`) is negative, the volume would not make physical sense, but the formula as implemented will still return a negative volume without errors, which may cause confusion in real-world applications. But since the problem description does not specify constraints on the values (such as them being non-negative), the program behaves correctly according to the given description.

2. The function will return results for all valid numerical inputs since it doesn't restrict the input type, thus making it versatile for integers and floats.

Since I cannot find an example where the program fails to produce the correct output based on the description, I conclude the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`, which are positive floats representing the base, height, and length of a triangular prism, respectively. It calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \((b \times h / 2) \times l\). However, the function assumes that all inputs are valid positive floats and does not handle cases where the inputs might be zero or negative, nor does it check for non-float inputs. Therefore, while it serves its intended purpose of calculating the volume, it lacks input validation to ensure that the inputs conform to the expected types and positive constraints.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
