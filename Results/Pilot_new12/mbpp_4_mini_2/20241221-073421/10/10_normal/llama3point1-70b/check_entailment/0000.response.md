Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula:

\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \]

where:
- `b` is the base of the triangular base of the prism,
- `h` is the height of the triangular base,
- `l` is the length (or depth) of the prism.

The expression `b * h / 2 * l` evaluates to the volume accurately for all valid input values of `b`, `h`, and `l`, including edge cases like zero values. 

1. If any of the dimensions (`b`, `h`, `l`) is negative, the volume would not make physical sense, but the formula as implemented will still return a negative volume without errors, which may cause confusion in real-world applications. But since the problem description does not specify constraints on the values (such as them being non-negative), the program behaves correctly according to the given description.

2. The function will return results for all valid numerical inputs since it doesn't restrict the input type, thus making it versatile for integers and floats.

Since I cannot find an example where the program fails to produce the correct output based on the description, I conclude the program is correct.
