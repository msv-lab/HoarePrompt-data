Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the calculation of the volume of a triangular prism based on the problem description. The formula used in the function `func_1` is mathematically correct for calculating the volume of a triangular prism, which is given by the formula:

\[
\text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}
\]

In the code, this is expressed as:

```python
return b * h / 2 * l
```

This correctly represents the volume calculation, where:
- `b` is the base of the triangular face,
- `h` is the height of the triangular face,
- `l` is the length of the prism.

The program also meets the requirements of the problem description by accepting three positive float parameters and returning the calculated volume. It is stated that the inputs will be valid, and therefore, the lack of explicit input validation does not affect its correctness. 

Overall, the function serves its intended purpose of calculating the volume of the triangular prism accurately according to the given formula. Thus, the implementation is correct, and it adheres to the specified problem description.
