Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula for the area of a triangle (which is \( \frac{b \times h}{2} \)) multiplied by the length \( l \) of the prism. The overall volume formula for a triangular prism is given as:

\[
\text{Volume} = \text{Area of triangle base} \times \text{Length} = \left(\frac{b \times h}{2}\right) \times l
\]

The function `func_1(b, h, l)` effectively computes this formula without missing any logic or edge cases. The variables \( b \), \( h \), and \( l \) can take on valid numerical values (including zeros or negative numbers, if considering a mathematical perspective) as long as they reflect meaningful dimensions of a prism, but the calculation itself remains valid.

Since no potential case was found where the program does not function according to the problem description, it is deemed correct.
