Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided annotated version. The function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \((b \times h / 2) \times l\), which is indeed the correct mathematical representation for calculating the volume based on the given dimensions. 

The annotations support this by explicitly stating that the function accepts positive floats for the base, height, and length, and correctly describes the calculation performed. While the annotations highlight the lack of input validation, they also make it clear that the assumptions are made regarding the validity of inputs, which is accepted in this context. Since the function fulfills the requirement to calculate the volume as described in the problem statement, the overall correctness remains valid, leading to the final conclusion.
