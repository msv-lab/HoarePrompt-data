The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`. All three parameters are positive floats, where `b` represents the base of the triangular prism, `h` represents the height of the triangular face, and `l` represents the length of the prism. The function calculates and returns the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \((b \times h / 2) \times l\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the base, height, and length of a triangular prism as positive float values and return the calculated volume of the prism. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `b`, `h`, and `l` as positive floats representing the base, height, and length of a triangular prism, and it returns the volume of the prism calculated as \((b \times h / 2) \times l\).**
