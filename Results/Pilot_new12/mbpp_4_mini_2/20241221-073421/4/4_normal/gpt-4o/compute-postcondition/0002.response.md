The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers. After executing the function body, if the result of the XOR operation between `a` and `b` (denoted as `xor_result`) is not equal to 0 and is a power of two (which means it has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b`, and return `True` if the XOR of `a` and `b` is a non-zero power of two; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, and returns `True` if the XOR of `a` and `b` is a non-zero power of two; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
