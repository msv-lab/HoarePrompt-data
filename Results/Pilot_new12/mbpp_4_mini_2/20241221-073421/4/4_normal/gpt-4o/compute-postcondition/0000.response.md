The variable `xor_result` is assigned the value of `a ^ b`, which is the bitwise XOR operation between integers `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Hence, the Output State will include the resulting value of `xor_result` but will also reflect that `a` and `b` remain unchanged integers. 

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `xor_result` is equal to `a ^ b`.**
