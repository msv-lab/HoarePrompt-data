To determine the correctness of the provided program `func_1`, we will analyze the logic and expected behavior. The goal is to check if two numbers differ by exactly one bit position.

### Understanding the Logic:
1. The program uses the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) to derive a value that reflects the differences between the two numbers.
2. If `a` and `b` differ by one bit, `xor_result` will be a power of two (i.e., it will have exactly one bit set).
3. The expression `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if `xor_result` is a power of two, which is true when there is only one differing bit.

### Test Cases:
The assertions provided seem to validate the function's correctness for various cases:
- `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` because 13 (1101) and 9 (1001) differ at one bit (the second bit from the right).
- `func_1(15, 8)` returns `False` because they differ in multiple bits.
- `func_1(2, 4)` returns `False` due to multiple differing bits (2: 10, 4: 100).
- `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` since they differ at one bit (2: 10, 3: 11).
- `func_1(5, 1)` returns `True` (5: 101, 1: 001 differ at one bit).
- `func_1(1, 5)` returns `True`, verifying the function is commutative.

### Testing Possible Edge Cases:
Now, let's consider testing edge cases and ensure the function behavior remains consistent:
- **Case of Same Numbers:**
    - `func_1(7, 7)` should return `False` (no differing bits).
- **Case of One Number Being Zero:**
    - `func_1(0, 1)` should return `True` (0: 0 differs from 1: 1 at one bit).
    - `func_1(0, 2)` should return `False` (0: 0 and 2: 10 differ in multiple bits).

### Conclusion:
The provided function correctly checks whether two numbers differ by one bit based on both the initial assertions and additional edge cases considered. It correctly handles cases where numbers are the same and numbers differ by multiple bits, returning expected results.

Based on the analysis and tests, I do not find any cases where the implementation fails or produces incorrect results. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
