You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(13, 9) == True
assert func_1(15, 8) == False
assert func_1(2, 4) == False
assert func_1(2, 3) == True
assert func_1(5, 1) == True
assert func_1(1, 5) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0
    #The program returns True if xor_result is not equal to 0 and it is a power of two (which means it has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation); otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`. It computes the XOR of `a` and `b`, storing the result in `xor_result`. The function then returns `True` if `xor_result` is a non-zero power of two (which means it has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation); otherwise, it returns `False`. Edge cases include scenarios where both `a` and `b` are the same (resulting in a `xor_result` of 0, which will yield `False`), and scenarios where one or both inputs are negative (though the logic still operates correctly, the meaning of "power of two" typically relates to positive integers). The function does not handle or check for non-integer inputs, which could lead to errors if used inappropriately.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
