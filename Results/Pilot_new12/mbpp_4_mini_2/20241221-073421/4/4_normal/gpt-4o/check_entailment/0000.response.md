Correctness: **True**.

The program checks whether two numbers differ by only one bit position using the XOR operation and ensures that the result has exactly one bit set. 

1. **XOR Operation**: The XOR of two numbers will have bits set to '1' where the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different. If the numbers differ by one bit, the result of the XOR will be a power of two (which has exactly one bit set).
   
2. **Checking for Power of Two**: The condition `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if there's exactly one bit set in `xor_result`. 

The test cases show that the function behaves correctly for the given pairs of numbers, ensuring that it returns `True` if they differ by exactly one bit and `False` otherwise. Since I cannot find any counterexamples where the logic of the function does not meet the requirements, I conclude it is correct.
