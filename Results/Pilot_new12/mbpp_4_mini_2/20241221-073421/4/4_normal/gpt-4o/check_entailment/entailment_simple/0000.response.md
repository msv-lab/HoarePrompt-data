The provided Python program `func_1` is designed to determine if two integers `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position. Let's analyze the program step-by-step to see if it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Program Analysis:
1. The program uses the XOR bitwise operator (`^`) to compare the two integers. When two bits are compared with XOR, the result is `1` where the bits are different and `0` where they are the same.
2. The `xor_result` will be non-zero if `a` and `b` differ in at least one bit.
3. The program checks if `xor_result` is a power of two by using the expression `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0`. This condition is true if there is exactly one bit set in `xor_result`, which means `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit position.
4. The function returns `True` if both conditions are met (non-zero result and power of two); otherwise, it returns `False`.

### Evaluating the Assertions:
- The assertions provided in the program are:
  - `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` (13 and 9 differ at one bit)
  - `func_1(15, 8)` returns `False` (15 and 8 differ at multiple bits)
  - `func_1(2, 4)` returns `False` (2 and 4 differ at multiple bits)
  - `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` (2 and 3 differ at one bit)
  - `func_1(5, 1)` returns `True` (5 and 1 differ at one bit)
  - `func_1(1, 5)` returns `True` (1 and 5 differ at one bit)

All test cases correctly evaluate whether the two numbers differ at only one bit position, which indicates that the program meets the problem description's requirements.

### Conclusion:
Based on this analysis, the function adheres to the problem description by correctly identifying whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position.

Correctness: **True**
