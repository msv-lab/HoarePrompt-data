#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    xor_result = a ^ b
    return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0
    #The program returns True if xor_result is not equal to 0 and it is a power of two (which means it has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation); otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`. It computes the XOR of `a` and `b`, storing the result in `xor_result`. The function then returns `True` if `xor_result` is a non-zero power of two (which means it has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation); otherwise, it returns `False`. Edge cases include scenarios where both `a` and `b` are the same (resulting in a `xor_result` of 0, which will yield `False`), and scenarios where one or both inputs are negative (though the logic still operates correctly, the meaning of "power of two" typically relates to positive integers). The function does not handle or check for non-integer inputs, which could lead to errors if used inappropriately.
