The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `num1` and `num2`. Both `num1` and `num2` are integers. After executing the function body, if `num1` and `num2` differ by exactly one bit (which means their XOR has exactly one '1' in binary representation), the function returns `True`. If they do not differ by exactly one bit, the function returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers, `num1` and `num2`, and determine if they differ by exactly one bit, returning `True` if they do, and `False` if they do not. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters, num1 and num2, and returns True if they differ by exactly one bit; otherwise, it returns False.**
