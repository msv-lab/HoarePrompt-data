Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `num1` and `num2`. It returns `True` if the two numbers differ by exactly one bit, which means that the result of their bitwise XOR operation has exactly one '1' in its binary representation. If they do not differ by exactly one bit, the function returns `False`. Additionally, potential edge cases include scenarios where either argument is negative or zero, but the function still evaluates the XOR correctly, as it is consistent with integer operations in Python. Thus, it accurately reflects the intended behavior without requiring additional checks for edge cases.
