The program checks if two integers differ in exactly one bit position by using the XOR operation followed by counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. If the count is exactly one, it indicates that the two numbers indeed differ at one bit position.

Output hints clarify that the function should return `True` if the two numbers differ by exactly one bit and return `False` otherwise. The hint also mentions that the function handles negative numbers and zero correctly in the context of bitwise operations.

After analyzing the provided information, it is clear that for any two valid integers, the function will correctly determine if they differ by exactly one bit. 

For example:
- `func_1(2, 3)` - XOR: `2 ^ 3 = 1` (binary `01`), count of '1's = 1, which is correct.
- `func_1(2, 4)` - XOR: `2 ^ 4 = 6` (binary `110`), count of '1's = 2, which is correct.
- `func_1(-1, 0)` - XOR for bit operations is negatively handled, resulting in correctly functioning checks.

There are no edge cases presented in the output hints that would lead to incorrect behavior as all possible integer combinations are correctly handled based on the properties of XOR and binary counting.

Correctness: **True**.
