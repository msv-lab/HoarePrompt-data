Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether two integers, `num1` and `num2`, differ at exactly one bit position. It uses the XOR operator (`^`) to identify differing bits between the two numbers. The result of the XOR operation will have a binary representation where each bit set to '1' indicates a position where the two numbers differ.

The function then converts this result to a binary string using `bin()` and counts the number of '1's using `.count('1')`. If this count equals 1, it means there is exactly one bit position at which `num1` and `num2` differ, and hence the function returns `True`. If the count is not equal to 1, it returns `False`.

This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description: to check if two numbers differ at one bit position only, as differentiating at one bit means the XOR of the two numbers results in a binary number with exactly one '1'. 

Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem requirements.
