Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem. The function `func_1` utilizes the bitwise XOR operator to effectively determine if the two integers `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position. The annotated version of the code further confirms that the program behaves as expected: it accurately returns `True` when there is one differing bit and `False` otherwise. The handling of edge cases (like negative integers) does not impact the correctness of the bitwise operation, which is well-defined in Python. Overall, the program aligns with the requirements of the problem description and is correctly validated by the annotations.
