Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the requirements of the problem description. Let's break down the reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes two integer inputs, `num1` and `num2`, and computes their bitwise XOR using the expression `num1 ^ num2`. The XOR operation will result in a binary number where each bit is set to `1` whenever the corresponding bits of the operands differ.

2. **Count the differing bits**: The program then converts the result of the XOR operation to its binary representation using `bin(...)`, and counts the number of `1`s in it with `.count('1')`.

3. **Specific condition**: It checks if the count of `1`s equals to `1`, which would indicate that `num1` and `num2` differ at exactly one bit position. If they differ by exactly one bit, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Edge cases**: The annotated code also mentions that the function handles edge cases such as negative numbers or zero correctly since XOR operation behaves consistently for all integers in Python.

The program meets all specified requirements and behaves correctly for all expected input scenarios, thereby fulfilling the problem description completely. Hence, it is correct.
