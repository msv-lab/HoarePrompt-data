Final: **True** 

The original assessment stating that the program's correctness is **True** aligns with the problem description and the behavior of the provided code. The function `func_1` effectively checks whether two integers differ at exactly one bit position by utilizing the XOR operation and counting the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the result. The annotation explains that this checks for the desired single bit difference accurately. Furthermore, scenarios with negative integers or zero do not hinder the function's ability to work correctly, as integer operations in Python handle these cases consistently. Thus, both the problem description and code behavior validate the original assessment.
