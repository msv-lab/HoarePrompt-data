Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. It does this by using the bitwise XOR operator (`^`) which highlights the bits that are different between the two numbers. The result of the XOR operation is then converted to binary using `bin()`, and the count of '1's in that binary representation is checked. If there is exactly one '1' (indicating one differing bit), it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This logic covers all potential cases:
1. When the numbers are the same, the result will have no '1's, hence returning `False`.
2. When the numbers differ at one bit position, it will return `True`.
3. If the numbers differ at more than one bit position, it will also return `False`.

No edge cases or exceptions to the problem have been identified that the program does not handle. Thus, the program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description for all potential cases.
