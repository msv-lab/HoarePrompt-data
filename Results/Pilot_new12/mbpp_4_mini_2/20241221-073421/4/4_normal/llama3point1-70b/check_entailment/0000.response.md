Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position using the XOR operator (`^`). When two numbers are XORed together, the result will have bits set to `1` where the corresponding bits of the two numbers differ. The function converts this result into a binary string and counts the number of `1`s. If there is exactly one `1`, it means the two numbers differ at one bit position only, fulfilling the problem requirement. 

For example:
- If `num1` is `5` (binary `101`) and `num2` is `4` (binary `100`), the XOR would yield `1` (binary `001`), which has one `1`. 
- If `num1` is `5` (binary `101`) and `num2` is `7` (binary `111`), the XOR would yield `2` (binary `010`), which again has one `1`.

Therefore, the function produces correct results for all potential cases based on the problem description, confirming its correctness.
