Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two integers (`num1` and `num2`) and checks whether they differ by exactly one bit position using the bitwise XOR operation. The result of the XOR operation will have a binary representation where '1' bits indicate the positions where the two numbers differ. The count of '1' bits is determined, and if it equals 1, the function returns `True`, indicating that the numbers differ at exactly one bit position. 

The output hints correctly summarize this behavior and state that the function can handle negative numbers and zero, which aligns with how Python treats integers. Since there are no identified edge cases or scenarios where the function can fail in accordance with the problem description, the implementation can be deemed correct for every potential case.
