#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if num1 and num2 differ by exactly one bit (their XOR has exactly one '1' in binary representation), otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters, `num1` and `num2`. It returns `True` if the two numbers differ by exactly one bit, which means that the result of their bitwise XOR operation has exactly one '1' in its binary representation. If they do not differ by exactly one bit, the function returns `False`. Additionally, potential edge cases include scenarios where either argument is negative or zero, but the function still evaluates the XOR correctly, as it is consistent with integer operations in Python. Thus, it accurately reflects the intended behavior without requiring additional checks for edge cases.
