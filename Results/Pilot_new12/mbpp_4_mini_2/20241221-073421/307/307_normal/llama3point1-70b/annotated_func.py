#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `idx` is the smallest integer such that the len of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`, `triangular_num` is the triangular number corresponding to the final value of `idx`, the loop executes until the while loop condition is satisfied when the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single positive integer parameter `n`, representing the number of digits. It calculates triangular numbers using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` iteratively, starting from `idx = 1`. The function continues until it finds the first triangular number whose string representation has a length greater than or equal to `n`. It then returns the index `idx` of that triangular number. The function correctly handles cases where `n` is small (1, 2, etc.) and returns appropriate indices (1, 2, or 3) based on the calculated triangular numbers. However, since the while loop is infinite by design, the function could potentially run indefinitely for edge cases where `n` is excessively large, if no limit is placed on `idx`.
