Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. However, there is a flaw in the logic used to determine when to return the index. Specifically, the condition `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` will incorrectly return an index if the triangular number has more than `n` digits, rather than exactly `n` digits.

For instance, if `n = 3`, the program would return the index for triangular numbers like 6 (which has 1 digit) and 10 (which has 2 digits) and finally it may return for 105 (which has 3 digits), but it could also find 136 (with 3 digits) and return for it as well. The first index that corresponds to a triangular number with exactly 3 digits (which is 105) would be returned, but the program would stop on the first occurrence where the condition is true, thus missing the correct required output.

To illustrate with a potential case:
- For `n = 3`, the program would return `14`, which is the index for the triangular number `105` (the first 3-digit triangular number), however, when `n = 2`, `idx` would yield triangular number `3` for index `3`, which has 2 digits but returns the index of the first triangular numbers as per the range and logic used.

The logic should check for exactly `n` digits, rather than `>= n`. Therefore, the program does not correctly fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.
