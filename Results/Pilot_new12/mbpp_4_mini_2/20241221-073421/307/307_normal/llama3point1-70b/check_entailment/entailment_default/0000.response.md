The provided program calculates triangular numbers based on the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, iterating through possible indices until it finds the first triangular number with a representation length greater than or equal to `n`. The output hints indicate that the function is designed to work correctly for cases where `n` is a small positive integer and returns appropriate indices based on calculated triangular numbers.

However, a critical evaluation of the function reveals a potential edge case where it could run indefinitely. The output hints mention that while it may handle small values of `n` (like 1, 2, etc.) effectively, it does not specify a termination condition for very large values of `n`. For example, suppose `n` is exceedingly large (e.g., `n = 1000`); in that situation, the while loop could theoretically continue for an unnecessarily long time if no triangular number meeting the digit length is found within practical bounds.

This indicates that the function may not adequately cater to the requirement for every potential case as the problem description expects it to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits without the risk of an infinite loop.

Correctness: **False**.
