Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The program calculates the triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, which is correct as it generates triangular numbers sequentially starting from `idx = 1`.

2. **Digit Count Verification**: The program checks the number of digits in the triangular number by converting it to a string and measuring its length with `len(str(triangular_num))`. 

3. **Loop Execution**: The while loop continues to iterate until it finds a triangular number that has a length (i.e., digit count) that is greater than or equal to `n`. Once this condition is satisfied, it returns the current value of `idx`, which corresponds to the index of the found triangular number.

4. **Correct Condition**: The program ensures that the triangular number meets the condition specified in the problem description â€” having at least `n` digits. 

Thus, the program fulfills the task as defined by the problem description and will work for any positive integer `n` represented as input.
