Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly points out that the logic in the program does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description. Specifically, the condition `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` leads to premature termination of the loop. The program should only return the index when a triangular number with exactly `n` digits is found. The output hints also support this evaluation, indicating that the function returns indices corresponding to triangular numbers that may have more digits than specified, meaning it can yield incorrect results for various inputs. Thus, the problem is not correctly solved as the assessment indicates and aligns with the identified flaws in the program's logic.
