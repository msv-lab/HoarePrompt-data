You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze how it relates to the given problem description: finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

A triangular number is calculated using the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), where \( k \) is the index of the triangular number. The algorithm correctly uses this formula in the loop to calculate triangular numbers.

The program begins with `idx` set to 1 and enters an infinite loop. For each value of `idx`, it calculates the triangular number and checks if the number of digits in that triangular number (derived from its string representation) is at least `n`. If this condition is met, it returns the current index `idx`.

### Potential edge case:
- For `n = 1`: The triangular number T1 = 1 (which has 1 digit) should return index 1.
- For `n = 2`: The smallest triangular number with 2 digits is T14 = 105 (which has 3 digits) returning index 14. So checking if T14 has at least 2 digits would return the correct index of 14.
- For `n = 3`: The triangular numbers increase in values, confirming the continuing correctness.
  
However, if we analyze the function for larger cases:
- If the input `n` is negative (e.g., `n = -1`), the current implementation will spin in an infinite loop and never return a value, as there are no triangular numbers with negative digits. The function does not handle the case for `n <= 0`.

Because there exists an input case (`n <= 0`) where the function does not return a valid index or even terminate, this demonstrates a flaw in the programâ€™s correctness.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single positive integer parameter `n`, representing the number of digits. It calculates triangular numbers using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` iteratively, starting from `idx = 1`. The function continues until it finds the first triangular number whose string representation has a length greater than or equal to `n`. It then returns the index `idx` of that triangular number. The function correctly handles cases where `n` is small (1, 2, etc.) and returns appropriate indices (1, 2, or 3) based on the calculated triangular numbers. However, since the while loop is infinite by design, the function could potentially run indefinitely for edge cases where `n` is excessively large, if no limit is placed on `idx`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
