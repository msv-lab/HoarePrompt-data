The original assessment of the program states that its correctness is **False** due to incorrect logic in the condition checking for the number of digits in the triangular number. The issue is highlighted that the program checks for `len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` instead of checking for `len(str(triangular_num)) == n`, which would be necessary to meet the specified condition of finding the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits.

Upon reviewing the problem description, which requires finding the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits, the program indeed does not fulfill this requirement. The annotated version confirms that the program continues executing until it finds a triangular number with a length that meets or exceeds `n`, which could yield indices for triangular numbers with more digits than specified. This erroneous logic directly impacts the correctness of the function in the context of the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because it rightly identifies that the check does not satisfy the core requirement of the task. The program will produce incorrect indices for triangular numbers based on the flawed condition.

Final: **False**
