You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. However, there is a flaw in the logic used to determine when to return the index. Specifically, the condition `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` will incorrectly return an index if the triangular number has more than `n` digits, rather than exactly `n` digits.

For instance, if `n = 3`, the program would return the index for triangular numbers like 6 (which has 1 digit) and 10 (which has 2 digits) and finally it may return for 105 (which has 3 digits), but it could also find 136 (with 3 digits) and return for it as well. The first index that corresponds to a triangular number with exactly 3 digits (which is 105) would be returned, but the program would stop on the first occurrence where the condition is true, thus missing the correct required output.

To illustrate with a potential case:
- For `n = 3`, the program would return `14`, which is the index for the triangular number `105` (the first 3-digit triangular number), however, when `n = 2`, `idx` would yield triangular number `3` for index `3`, which has 2 digits but returns the index of the first triangular numbers as per the range and logic used.

The logic should check for exactly `n` digits, rather than `>= n`. Therefore, the program does not correctly fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `idx` is the smallest integer such that the len of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`, `triangular_num` is the triangular number corresponding to the final value of `idx`, the loop executes until the while loop condition is satisfied when the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single positive integer parameter `n`, representing the number of digits. It calculates triangular numbers using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` iteratively, starting from `idx = 1`. The function continues until it finds the first triangular number whose string representation has a length greater than or equal to `n`. It then returns the index `idx` of that triangular number. The function correctly handles cases where `n` is small (1, 2, etc.) and returns appropriate indices (1, 2, or 3) based on the calculated triangular numbers. However, since the while loop is infinite by design, the function could potentially run indefinitely for edge cases where `n` is excessively large, if no limit is placed on `idx`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
