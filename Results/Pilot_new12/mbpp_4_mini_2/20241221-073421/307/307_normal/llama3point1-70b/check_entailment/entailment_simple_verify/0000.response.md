The provided code aims to find the index of the smallest triangular number that contains `n` digits. However, as observed in the original assessment, the condition `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n` is problematic. This condition allows for the function to return an index even if the triangular number has more digits than necessary, thus failing to identify the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits.

The annotations further clarify that the loop continues until it finds a triangular number with a length greater than or equal to `n`, which accurately reflects how the loop executes, but fails to correct the issue present in determining the right index. The program does not check for "exactly `n` digits" which is what's required by the problem statement. It will stop at the first instance where a triangular number has a length of digits `>= n`, missing the correct output target.

Thus, the original assessment is indeed accurate, as it captures the flawed logic in determining the correct index based on the digit count of the triangular number.

Final: **False**
