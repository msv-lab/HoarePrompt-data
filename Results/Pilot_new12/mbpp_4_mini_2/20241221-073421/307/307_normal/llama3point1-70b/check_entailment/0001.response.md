To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze how it relates to the given problem description: finding the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.

A triangular number is calculated using the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \), where \( k \) is the index of the triangular number. The algorithm correctly uses this formula in the loop to calculate triangular numbers.

The program begins with `idx` set to 1 and enters an infinite loop. For each value of `idx`, it calculates the triangular number and checks if the number of digits in that triangular number (derived from its string representation) is at least `n`. If this condition is met, it returns the current index `idx`.

### Potential edge case:
- For `n = 1`: The triangular number T1 = 1 (which has 1 digit) should return index 1.
- For `n = 2`: The smallest triangular number with 2 digits is T14 = 105 (which has 3 digits) returning index 14. So checking if T14 has at least 2 digits would return the correct index of 14.
- For `n = 3`: The triangular numbers increase in values, confirming the continuing correctness.
  
However, if we analyze the function for larger cases:
- If the input `n` is negative (e.g., `n = -1`), the current implementation will spin in an infinite loop and never return a value, as there are no triangular numbers with negative digits. The function does not handle the case for `n <= 0`.

Because there exists an input case (`n <= 0`) where the function does not return a valid index or even terminate, this demonstrates a flaw in the programâ€™s correctness.

Correctness: **False**
