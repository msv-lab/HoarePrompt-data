Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description, which is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. 

Here's why:
1. **Function Input**: The function takes a single positive integer `n` as input, which represents the number of digits required in the triangular number.
2. **Triangular Number Calculation**: The function uses the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` to compute the triangular numbers. This formula correctly generates the nth triangular number based on the current `idx`.
3. **Loop Logic**: The while loop continues indefinitely until the triangular number with at least `n` digits is found. The check `if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:` accurately evaluates whether the number of digits in the triangular number meets or exceeds `n`.
4. **Return Value**: Once the condition is met, the function returns the current index `idx`, which is the desired output as per the problem description.

The process continues until the function finds the first triangular number with a sufficient number of digits, thus ensuring that it meets all potential cases described in the problem. Even for large values of `n`, the loop is guaranteed to find a solution because triangular numbers grow indefinitely, making it reliable for any valid input.

Consequently, the function does what the problem description specifies for every potential case as described.
