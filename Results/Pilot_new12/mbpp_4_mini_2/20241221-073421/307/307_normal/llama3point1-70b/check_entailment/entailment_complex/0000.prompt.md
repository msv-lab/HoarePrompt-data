You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `idx` is the smallest integer such that the len of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`, `triangular_num` is the triangular number corresponding to the final value of `idx`, the loop executes until the while loop condition is satisfied when the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` becomes greater than or equal to `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single positive integer parameter `n`, representing the number of digits. It calculates triangular numbers using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` iteratively, starting from `idx = 1`. The function continues until it finds the first triangular number whose string representation has a length greater than or equal to `n`. It then returns the index `idx` of that triangular number. The function correctly handles cases where `n` is small (1, 2, etc.) and returns appropriate indices (1, 2, or 3) based on the calculated triangular numbers. However, since the while loop is infinite by design, the function could potentially run indefinitely for edge cases where `n` is excessively large, if no limit is placed on `idx`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
