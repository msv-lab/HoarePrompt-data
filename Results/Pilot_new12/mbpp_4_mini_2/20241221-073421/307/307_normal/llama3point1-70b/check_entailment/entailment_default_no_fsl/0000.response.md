Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. While it calculates the triangular numbers and correctly identifies when to return the index for small input values of `n`, it may enter an infinite loop if `n` is excessively large. This is because the while loop does not have a termination condition based on the magnitude of `n`. The hints indicate that the program could run indefinitely for such cases, which directly contradicts the need for the function to operate robustly for all input ranges.

For example, if `n` is very large (e.g., 1000), the program could run indefinitely because it would need to calculate an extremely high index before finding a triangular number that meets the digit requirement. Thus, the program fails to properly handle the edge case of overly large `n`, and this is sufficient evidence that the overall correctness of the program should be marked as false.
