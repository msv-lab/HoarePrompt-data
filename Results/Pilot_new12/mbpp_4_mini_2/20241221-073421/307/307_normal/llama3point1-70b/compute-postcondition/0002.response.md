The value of `triangular_num` is calculated by the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is initially 1, we can substitute this into the formula:

`triangular_num` becomes `1 * (1 + 1) // 2` which simplifies to `1 * 2 // 2`, resulting in `1`.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `idx` is 1; `triangular_num` is 1.**
