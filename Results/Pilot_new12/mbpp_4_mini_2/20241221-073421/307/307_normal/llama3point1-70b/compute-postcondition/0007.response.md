Since the loop is `while True`, it will execute indefinitely unless a break condition is encountered within the loop body. Therefore, we donâ€™t need to make any adjustments to the program state for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `idx` is 2; `triangular_num` is 1. The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
