Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `triangular_num` is 6, and `idx` is 3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns the value of `idx`, which is 3. Otherwise, there is no return value from the function.***
