The variable `idx` is assigned the value of 1. The value of `n` remains a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `idx` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `idx` is 1**.
