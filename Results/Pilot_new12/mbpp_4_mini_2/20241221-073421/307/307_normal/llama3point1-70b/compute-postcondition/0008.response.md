`triangular_num` is assigned the value of `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 2, we can calculate `triangular_num` as follows:

```
triangular_num = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2
                = 2 * 3 // 2
                = 6 // 2
                = 3
```

Now we update the relevant variables. `n` remains the same (as its value remains valid and unchanged), `idx` also remains unchanged, but `triangular_num` is now 3. The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` (which is "3") is still less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `idx` is 2; `triangular_num` is 3; the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
