The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number. The output of the function varies according to the cases defined:

- In Case 1, if the first triangular number found has a string representation of length greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns `idx`, which is 1.
- In Case 2, if the second triangular number found meets the criteria, it returns the value of `idx`, which is 2.
- In Case 3, if the third triangular number found meets the criteria, it returns the value of `idx`, which is 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the index of the first triangular number that has a string representation of length greater than or equal to `n`, with specific cases indicating when the function returns 1, 2, or 3 based on the index of the triangular number found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a positive integer, and returns 1, 2, or 3 depending on the index of the first triangular number found with a string representation length greater than or equal to n.**
