According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it is designed to execute indefinitely. Therefore, it can execute the first time without any conditions needing to be met regarding `n` or `idx`. Both variables are not restricting the execution of the loop. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `idx` is 1**
