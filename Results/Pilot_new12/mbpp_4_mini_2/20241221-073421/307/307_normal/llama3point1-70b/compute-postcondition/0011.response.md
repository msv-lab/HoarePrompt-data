The value of `idx` is incremented by 1, changing `idx` from 2 to 3. The states of the other variables, `n` and `triangular_num`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is now 3, and `triangular_num` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is now 3, and `triangular_num` is 3.**
