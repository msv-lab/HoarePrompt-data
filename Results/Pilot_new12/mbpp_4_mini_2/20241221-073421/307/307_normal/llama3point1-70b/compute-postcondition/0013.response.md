The value of `triangular_num` is updated by calculating `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. Given that `idx` is 3, the calculation becomes `3 * (3 + 1) // 2`, which results in `6`. Thus, `triangular_num` is updated to 6. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 3, and `triangular_num` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 6**
