In this case, the `while` loop is a `while True`, which means it will always execute unless interrupted by a break statement or similar condition. Since there is no condition that would naturally lead the loop to stop, it will execute again regardless of the program state.

Thus, there are no adjustments needed to ensure the loop can execute one more time; it will continue to run indefinitely.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `idx` is now 3, and `triangular_num` is 3**.
