`idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` was 1, so now `idx` will be 2. The other variables `n` and `triangular_num` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number; `idx` is 2; `triangular_num` is 1. The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
