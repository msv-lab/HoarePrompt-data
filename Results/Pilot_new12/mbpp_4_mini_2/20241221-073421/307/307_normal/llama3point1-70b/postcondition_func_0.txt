The function `func_1` accepts a single positive integer parameter `n`, representing the number of digits. It calculates triangular numbers using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2` iteratively, starting from `idx = 1`. The function continues until it finds the first triangular number whose string representation has a length greater than or equal to `n`. It then returns the index `idx` of that triangular number. The function correctly handles cases where `n` is small (1, 2, etc.) and returns appropriate indices (1, 2, or 3) based on the calculated triangular numbers. However, since the while loop is infinite by design, the function could potentially run indefinitely for edge cases where `n` is excessively large, if no limit is placed on `idx`.
