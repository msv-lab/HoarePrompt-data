The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of digits in a triangular number. The function returns the smallest positive integer `k` such that the `k`-th triangular number, calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, has exactly `n` digits. The function continuously computes triangular numbers starting from `k = 1` and checks their digit count until it finds one that has exactly `n` digits. There are no specific returns for cases where no triangular number exists with `n` digitsâ€”if `n` is too large, the function may run indefinitely.
