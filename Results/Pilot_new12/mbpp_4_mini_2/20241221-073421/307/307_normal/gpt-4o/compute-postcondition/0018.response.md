The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number. The function has multiple cases for its return value:

- Case_1: The function returns `k`, which is equal to 1.
- Case_2: The function returns 2, which is the value of `k`.
- Case_3: The function returns `k`, which is 3.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return different values of `k` based on specific conditions defined in the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, a positive integer, and returns different values based on certain conditions: it may return 1, 2, or 3 depending on the case fulfilled.**
