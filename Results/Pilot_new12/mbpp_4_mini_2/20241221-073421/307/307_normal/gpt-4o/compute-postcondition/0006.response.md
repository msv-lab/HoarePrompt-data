The value of `k` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `k` was 1, so after the execution, `k` is now 2. The values of `n` and `triangular_number` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
