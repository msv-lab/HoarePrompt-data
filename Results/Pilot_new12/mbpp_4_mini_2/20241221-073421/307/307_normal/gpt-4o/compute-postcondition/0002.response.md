The variable `triangular_number` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Since the initial state indicates that `k` is `1`, we can calculate `triangular_number` as follows:

`triangular_number = 1 * (1 + 1) // 2 = 1 * 2 // 2 = 2 // 2 = 1`

The values of `n` remain unchanged, as the code only affects the value of `triangular_number`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 1, `triangular_number` is 1**
