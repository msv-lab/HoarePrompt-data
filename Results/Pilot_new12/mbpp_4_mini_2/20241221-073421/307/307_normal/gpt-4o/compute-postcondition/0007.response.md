According to the code, the `while True` loop will always execute as it has no termination condition. Therefore, it will continue to execute indefinitely, meaning there is no need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**
