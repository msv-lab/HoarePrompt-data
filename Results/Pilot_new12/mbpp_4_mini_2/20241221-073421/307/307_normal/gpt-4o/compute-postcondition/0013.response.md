The value of `triangular_number` is being updated to the result of the expression `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 3, we can calculate `triangular_number` as follows: 

1. Calculate `k + 1`, which is `3 + 1 = 4`.
2. Multiply `k` by `k + 1`: `3 * 4 = 12`.
3. Perform integer division by 2: `12 // 2 = 6`.

Thus, `triangular_number` is assigned the value `6`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6**.
