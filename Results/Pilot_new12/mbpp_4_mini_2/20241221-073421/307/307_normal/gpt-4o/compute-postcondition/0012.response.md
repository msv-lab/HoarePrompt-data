According to the code, since this is a `while True` loop, it is designed to execute indefinitely, as there is no exit condition. At the end of the last iteration, regardless of the values of `n`, `k`, and `triangular_number`, the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to maintain the continuation of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3**.
