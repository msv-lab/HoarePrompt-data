The initial state indicates that `n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, and `triangular_number` is 3. The code snippet increments the value of `k` by 1. The previous value of `k` is 2, so after the code execution, `k` will be 3. The value of `triangular_number` remains unchanged, and there is no condition to check for a return value since the snippet does not contain a return statement. Therefore, the output state only reflects the updated value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is 3.**
