Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is the smallest integer such that the triangular number `triangular_number` (calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`) has exactly `n` digits. If the loop executed `m` times, `k` would be `m + 1`, where `triangular_number` would be the first triangular number with `n` digits.**
