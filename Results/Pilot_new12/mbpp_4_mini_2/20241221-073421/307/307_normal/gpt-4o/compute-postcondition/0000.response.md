The code initializes the variable `k` to 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 1**
