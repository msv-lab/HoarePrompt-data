The value of `triangular_number` is calculated using the formula \( k \times (k + 1) // 2 \). Given that \( k \) is 2, we can compute the triangular number as follows: 

\[
triangular\_number = 2 \times (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 \times 3 // 2 = 3
\]

The length of the string representation of the new value of `triangular_number` (which is 3) still does not equal `n`, as `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, which is likely greater than 1.

Therefore, the updated state reflects the new value for `triangular_number`, while `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is still not equal to `n`.**
