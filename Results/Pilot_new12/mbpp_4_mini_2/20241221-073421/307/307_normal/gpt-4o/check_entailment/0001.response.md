To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to check if the function `func_1(n)` finds the index of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits.

A triangular number for a given `k` is calculated using the formula:
\[ T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \]

The function `func_1(n)`:
- Initializes `k` to 1.
- Calculates the triangular number `T_k`.
- Checks the length of `T_k` when converted to a string. If the length equals `n`, it returns `k`.
- If the length is not `n`, it increments `k` and repeats the process.

Now let's analyze the function against the problem statement.

The assertions provided suggest the following expected outputs:
- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number is 3 (which is `T_2`), and its index (k) is 2.
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number is 6 (which is `T_3`), and its index (k) is 3.
- For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number is 10 (which is `T_4`), and its index (k) is 4.
- However, the assertions claim that for `n = 2`, the output should be `4`, which is incorrect, as `T_4 = 10` is not the first triangular number with 2 digits. The first triangular number with 2 digits is actually `T_2 = 3`, which contradicts the assertion.

Additionally:
- The program does not handle the case where `n = 1` (for completeness), as the smallest triangular number is `1` (which is `T_1`).
- The assertion values for `n = 2`, `3`, and `4` are incorrect as stated.

Thus, we find that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement, specifically with incorrect assertion values regarding triangular number indices.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not work correctly for the given problem description due to incorrect assertion values provided in the specification.
