After reviewing the problem description, the program, the original assessment, and the annotated code, I conclude the following:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the index of the smallest triangular number with a specified number of digits `n`.

2. **Program Functionality**: The function `func_1(n)` calculates triangular numbers using the formula \( T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \) and checks whether the number of digits in the triangular number matches `n`. It continues this process until it finds the correct index `k` where this condition holds true.

3. **Assessments**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the assertions in the code do not align with the expected outputs for triangular numbers, as for `n = 2` the smallest triangular number is 3 (which is `T_2`), with an index of 2, and not 4.
   - The same applies for `n = 3` and `n = 4`, which are misrepresented in the assertions.

4. **Analysis of Annotated Code**:
   - The annotations clarify the function's behavior before and after the loop, correctly noting that the loop will iterate until it finds a `k` such that the number of digits in the corresponding triangular number equals `n`.
   - However, they do not rectify the correctness of the assertions provided initially. The function and its logic are sound but the assertions as stated are incorrect.

Given this thorough examination, I find that the assertions do not meet the conditions set out by the problem description, and thus, the function does not fulfill the task correctly according to these assertions. 

Therefore, maintaining the original conclusion, the final correctness of the program is:

Final: **False**
