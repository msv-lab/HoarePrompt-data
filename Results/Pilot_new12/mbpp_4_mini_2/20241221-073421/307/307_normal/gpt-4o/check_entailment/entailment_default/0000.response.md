The provided program `func_1` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits. The program uses a while loop to continuously compute triangular numbers using the formula \( k \times (k + 1) / 2 \) starting from \( k = 1 \).

The output hints clarify that the function is supposed to return the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that the \( k \)-th triangular number has exactly \( n \) digits. However, there is a significant issue with the implementation of the function.

While the function correctly continues to iterate and compute triangular numbers, it does not account for any potential upper limits of \( n \). Specifically, if \( n \) is exceedingly large, say \( n = 1000 \), the function may run indefinitely without a valid stop condition since there is no inherent upper limit for triangular numbers with increasing \( k \). Thus, while checking for \( k \) such that the triangular number has exactly \( n \) digits, if no such number exists within a reasonable range, the function may never return, ultimately leading to an infinite loop scenario.

This flaw reveals that the function may not work as expected for all potential cases where \( n \) is large enough such that there becomes no triangular number with \( n \) digits.

Correctness: **False**.
