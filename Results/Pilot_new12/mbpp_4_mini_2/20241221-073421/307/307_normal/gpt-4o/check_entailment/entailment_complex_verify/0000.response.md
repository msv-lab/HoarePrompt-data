Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly find the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits, as evidenced by the annotations and the problem description. The function's approach of counting digits by converting the triangular number to a string and checking its length can lead to incorrect results, particularly for larger `n` values. 

The potential issue arises in the spacing of triangular numbers and how they increase, which could mean that the calculation could skip legitimate candidates when transitioning between `n` and `n + 1` digits. The example highlighted in the original assessment where the smallest triangular number with 5 digits is missed illustrates this flaw. For large values of `n`, the function may also run indefinitely if a valid triangular number is not found within the computed range, as noted in the annotations.

Overall, while the function can correctly return results for smaller `n`, it fundamentally fails to comply with the problem requirements in certain edge cases, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
