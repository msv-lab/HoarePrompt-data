You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to check if the function `func_1(n)` finds the index of the smallest triangular number that has exactly `n` digits.

A triangular number for a given `k` is calculated using the formula:
\[ T_k = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \]

The function `func_1(n)`:
- Initializes `k` to 1.
- Calculates the triangular number `T_k`.
- Checks the length of `T_k` when converted to a string. If the length equals `n`, it returns `k`.
- If the length is not `n`, it increments `k` and repeats the process.

Now let's analyze the function against the problem statement.

The assertions provided suggest the following expected outputs:
- For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number is 3 (which is `T_2`), and its index (k) is 2.
- For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number is 6 (which is `T_3`), and its index (k) is 3.
- For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number is 10 (which is `T_4`), and its index (k) is 4.
- However, the assertions claim that for `n = 2`, the output should be `4`, which is incorrect, as `T_4 = 10` is not the first triangular number with 2 digits. The first triangular number with 2 digits is actually `T_2 = 3`, which contradicts the assertion.

Additionally:
- The program does not handle the case where `n = 1` (for completeness), as the smallest triangular number is `1` (which is `T_1`).
- The assertion values for `n = 2`, `3`, and `4` are incorrect as stated.

Thus, we find that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem statement, specifically with incorrect assertion values regarding triangular number indices.

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not work correctly for the given problem description due to incorrect assertion values provided in the specification.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of digits in a triangular number. The function returns the smallest positive integer `k` such that the `k`-th triangular number, calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, has exactly `n` digits. The function continuously computes triangular numbers starting from `k = 1` and checks their digit count until it finds one that has exactly `n` digits. There are no specific returns for cases where no triangular number exists with `n` digitsâ€”if `n` is too large, the function may run indefinitely.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
