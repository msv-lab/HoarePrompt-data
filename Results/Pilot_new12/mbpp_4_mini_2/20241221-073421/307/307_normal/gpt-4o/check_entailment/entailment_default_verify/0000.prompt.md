You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits. However, it uses the `len(str(triangular_number))` to check for the number of digits, which may cause it to fail for certain values of `n`. 

For example, if we test `n = 1`, the function returns `k = 1` because the triangular number `1` (from the formula `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`) has 1 digit, which is correct. However, if we consider `n = 5`, the triangular number `15` has `2` digits but the next triangular number `21` has `2` digits too. The first triangular number with `n = 5` digits is `1,000,000`, which corresponds to the `k` value of `2000`, but the program does not verify this thoroughly. 

The implementation also incorrectly skips the check for triangular numbers that might transition from `n` to `n + 1` digits without finding the smallest. The triangular numbers grow quickly but the implementation may fail to correctly identify when to stop iterating or return the most appropriate `k` for larger `n` values, such as `6`, `7`, or beyond.

In summary, due to failing to correctly find the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits for various cases, the function does not satisfy the problem requirements entirely. Therefore, the correctness is marked as false.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of digits in a triangular number. The function returns the smallest positive integer `k` such that the `k`-th triangular number, calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, has exactly `n` digits. The function continuously computes triangular numbers starting from `k = 1` and checks their digit count until it finds one that has exactly `n` digits. There are no specific returns for cases where no triangular number exists with `n` digitsâ€”if `n` is too large, the function may run indefinitely.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
