Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has exactly 'n' digits as described in the problem statement. 

### Explanation:

1. **Triangular Number Calculation**:
   - The program computes triangular numbers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the correct formula for the k-th triangular number.

2. **Digit Length Check**:
   - It checks the length of the string representation of the triangular number to determine if it has exactly 'n' digits using `len(str(triangular_number)) == n`. This correctly identifies triangular numbers with the specified number of digits.

3. **Incrementing k**:
   - The program starts with `k = 1` and increments `k` with each iteration of the while loop until it finds a triangular number with 'n' digits. 

4. **Return Value**:
   - When it finds the first triangular number with 'n' digits, it returns `k`, which is the index of that triangular number. This matches the requirement to find the index of the smallest triangular number with 'n' digits.

5. **Functionality**:
   - The assertions provided (e.g., `assert func_1(2) == 4`, etc.) demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for specific cases, confirming its correctness for those inputs.

The solution handles the requirements of the problem as stated and efficiently finds the correct index of the smallest triangular number with the given number of digits. Therefore, it adheres strictly to the problem description.
