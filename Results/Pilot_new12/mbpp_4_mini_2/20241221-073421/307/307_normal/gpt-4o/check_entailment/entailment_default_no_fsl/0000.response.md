Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where no triangular number exists with `n` digits adequately. While it returns the correct values for inputs of `n` equal to 2, 3, and 4 based on the provided assertions, the function may run indefinitely for larger values of `n` if no triangular number with that many digits exists. For example, if `n` were too large (e.g., 1000), the program would continuously compute triangular numbers without an end condition, violating the requirement to determine the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits.

Thus, since the program does not correctly account for every potential case due to the lack of termination for large or unbounded inputs, it cannot be considered correct.
