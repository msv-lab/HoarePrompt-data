Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to find the index of the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits. However, it uses the `len(str(triangular_number))` to check for the number of digits, which may cause it to fail for certain values of `n`. 

For example, if we test `n = 1`, the function returns `k = 1` because the triangular number `1` (from the formula `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`) has 1 digit, which is correct. However, if we consider `n = 5`, the triangular number `15` has `2` digits but the next triangular number `21` has `2` digits too. The first triangular number with `n = 5` digits is `1,000,000`, which corresponds to the `k` value of `2000`, but the program does not verify this thoroughly. 

The implementation also incorrectly skips the check for triangular numbers that might transition from `n` to `n + 1` digits without finding the smallest. The triangular numbers grow quickly but the implementation may fail to correctly identify when to stop iterating or return the most appropriate `k` for larger `n` values, such as `6`, `7`, or beyond.

In summary, due to failing to correctly find the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits for various cases, the function does not satisfy the problem requirements entirely. Therefore, the correctness is marked as false.
