Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description by defining the function `func_1` to search for the smallest index `k` of triangular numbers that have exactly `n` digits. 

Here's how the program adheres to the problem description:

1. **Definition of Triangular Numbers**: The function calculates triangular numbers using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is indeed the correct formula for the k-th triangular number.

2. **Digit Count Check**: The program checks the number of digits in the computed triangular number by converting it to a string and measuring its length with `len(str(triangular_number))`. This matches the requirement to find triangular numbers with a specific digit count.

3. **Iterative Search**: The function starts from `k = 1` and uses a `while True` loop to continuously compute triangular numbers. It increments `k` until it finds the first triangular number with exactly `n` digits and returns `k`.

4. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions provided further validate that for the inputs `2`, `3`, and `4`, the function returns `4`, `14`, and `45`, respectively. These assertions confirm that the derived outputs are as expected for the smallest triangular numbers with the corresponding number of digits.

Additionally, since `n` is assumed to be a positive integer, the program will not encounter undefined behavior for valid inputs.

Overall, the program's logic and structure ensure that it satisfies the problem description effectively and handles the intended cases correctly.
