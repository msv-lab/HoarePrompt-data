The original assessment marked the program's correctness as **False** because it stated that the program fails to correctly identify the smallest triangular number with exactly `n` digits for certain values of `n`. This includes potential edge cases and transitions between different digit counts without accurately finding the necessary `k`. 

Given the annotated version, it can be observed that while the logic iteratively checks for the number of digits in the triangular number using `len(str(triangular_number))`, the approach does capture the iteration cadence of triangular numbers sequentially but may miss larger values where digits transition.

The assertions provided also imply that the function works correctly for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`, with expected outputs of `4`, `14`, and `45` aligning with known triangular numbers that meet the digit requirements. However, the function indeed only returns the first instance it checks, which raises concerns about the robustness of its logic in edge cases.

Overall, the original assessment accurately reflects the deficiencies of the program in handling various inputs effectively, especially concerning digit transitions. The provided functionality through the annotated states and the limitations highlighted in the assessment affirm that there can be instances where the program does not fulfill its purpose reliably.

Therefore, maintaining the original assessment is substantiated. 

Final: **False**
