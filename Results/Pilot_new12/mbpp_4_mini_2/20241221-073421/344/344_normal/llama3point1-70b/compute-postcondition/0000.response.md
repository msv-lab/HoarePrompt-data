According to the code, the loop executes based on the length of `sorted_list`. For the loop to run at least once, `sorted_list` must contain at least one element. Given that `sorted_list` is sorted in ascending order, the variable `i` represents the current index in the iteration. At the end of the last iteration of the loop, `i` would equal the length of `sorted_list`.

To ensure that the loop will execute, we need to confirm that `sorted_list` has at least one element and set the initial condition for `i`. Therefore, the necessary adjustments are that `sorted_list` must have at least 1 element and `i` starts at 0, representing the first iteration.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0**
