Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sorted_list`, which is a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order, and a parameter `value`, which is an element that can be compared to the elements in `sorted_list`. It returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`. If `value` is less than or equal to all elements in `sorted_list`, it returns the index `0`. If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, it returns the length of `sorted_list`. If `sorted_list` is empty, the function will return `0` as it does not enter the loop, indicating that there is no element to compare with `value`. The function does not handle cases where `value` might not be comparable to the elements in `sorted_list`, but assumes that comparison is valid.**
