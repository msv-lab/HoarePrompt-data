Output State: **`sorted_list` is a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order, `value` is an element that can be compared to the elements in `sorted_list`. If `value` is less than or equal to the smallest element in `sorted_list`, the loop will execute up to the length of `sorted_list` with `i` being the last index of the list (i.e., `len(sorted_list) - 1`). If `value` is greater than or equal to the largest element of `sorted_list`, the loop executes completely with no return, and `i` will equal `len(sorted_list)`. If the list is empty, the loop won't execute, and `i` will not be defined.`**
