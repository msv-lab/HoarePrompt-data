Postcondition: ***`sorted_list` is a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order with at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2. If `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, the function returns the value of `i`, which is 2. If `sorted_list[i]` is less than `value`, no value is returned.***
