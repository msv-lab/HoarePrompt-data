According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `sorted_list`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `sorted_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and since `sorted_list` must have at least 1 element, it currently has at least 1 element.

For the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 1. If `i` is now 1, for the loop to execute again, `sorted_list` must have at least 2 elements.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
