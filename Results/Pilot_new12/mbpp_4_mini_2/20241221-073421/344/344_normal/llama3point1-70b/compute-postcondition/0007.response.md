According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `sorted_list`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than the length of `sorted_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `sorted_list` is known to have at least 2 elements, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1. 

So after the last iteration, `i` will be incremented to 2. Since `sorted_list` has at least 2 elements, it must have at least 3 to allow for `i` to be 2 and to execute the loop one more time.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order that has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
