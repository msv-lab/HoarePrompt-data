Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` meets the requirements set out in the problem description, which is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Here is why the program is correct:

1. **Inputs**: The function takes two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is guaranteed to be a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order, and `value`, which is an element that can be compared with the elements of `sorted_list`. This ensures that the function is being tested with valid inputs.

2. **Iteration and Comparison**: The `for` loop iterates over the indices of `sorted_list`. For each element, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to `value`. If it finds such an element, it immediately returns the index `i`, which represents the position where `value` can be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

3. **Handling Different Cases**:
   - If `value` is less than or equal to the smallest element in `sorted_list`, the loop will reach the first element and return `0`, which is the correct insertion point.
   - If `value` is greater than or equal to the largest element in `sorted_list`, the loop will complete without finding a larger or equal element, and the function will return `len(sorted_list)`, which is the correct insertion point at the end of the list.
   - If `sorted_list` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function will return `0`, indicating that the correct insertion point is at the start of the list.

Overall, the program correctly identifies the insertion point based on the comparisons it performs, effectively fulfilling the problem description's requirement to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. Thus, we conclude that the program is correct.
