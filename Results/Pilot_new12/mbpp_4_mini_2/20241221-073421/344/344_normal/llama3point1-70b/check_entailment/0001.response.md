To analyze the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to verify that it accurately identifies the correct insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list.

### Problem Re-examination:
The problem requires a function that:
- Takes a sorted list and a value as inputs.
- Returns the index at which the value can be inserted in the list while maintaining the sorted order.

### Code Analysis:
Here is the provided program:

```python
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)
```

### Step by Step Analysis:
1. **For Each Element in the List**: The function loops through each element of the `sorted_list`.
2. **Checking Condition**: It checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified `value`.
3. **Returning Index**: If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns the current index `i`.
4. **After Loop**: If the loop completes without finding an element greater than or equal to `value`, it returns `len(sorted_list)`, indicating that the `value` is greater than all elements in the list and should be appended at the end.

### Finding Edge Cases:
Let's consider potential edge cases:

1. **Case of Inserting Smaller Value**:
   - Input: `sorted_list = [1, 2, 3]`, `value = 0`
     - Expected Output: `0` (should insert at the beginning).
     - The program will return `0`, which is correct.

2. **Case of Inserting Larger Value**:
   - Input: `sorted_list = [1, 2, 3]`, `value = 4`
     - Expected Output: `3` (should insert at the end).
     - The program will return `3`, which is correct.

3. **Case of Inserting Existing Value**:
   - Input: `sorted_list = [1, 2, 3]`, `value = 2`
     - Expected Output: `1` (should insert before 3, at index of 2).
     - The program will return `1`, which is correct.

4. **Case of Inserting at Beginning with Negative Number**:
   - Input: `sorted_list = [1, 2, 3]`, `value = -1`
     - Expected Output: `0` (should insert at the beginning).
     - The program will return `0`, which is correct.

5. **Inserting Value Equal to Largest**:
   - Input: `sorted_list = [1, 2, 3]`, `value = 3`
     - Expected Output: `2` (should insert before any existing occurrence of 3).
     - The program will return `2`, which is correct.

All examined cases indicate that the program correctly identifies the insertion index in the sorted order.

### Conclusion:
Since I could not find any case where the program does not meet the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
