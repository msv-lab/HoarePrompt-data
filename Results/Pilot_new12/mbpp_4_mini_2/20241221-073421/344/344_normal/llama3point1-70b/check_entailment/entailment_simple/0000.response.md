Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.

### Explanation of Correctness:

1. **Sorted List**: The function `func_1` receives a sorted list (`sorted_list`) and a value (`value`).

2. **Loop Through List**: The function iterates through each element of the `sorted_list` using a for loop:
   - It checks if the current element (`sorted_list[i]`) is greater than or equal to the `value`.
   - If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to `value`, it correctly returns the index `i`, which represents the first position where the `value` could be inserted without violating the order.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `value` is less than or equal to the first element in `sorted_list`, the function will return 0, which is the correct index for insertion.
   - If `value` is greater than or equal to the largest element in `sorted_list`, the function will iterate through the entire list and return `len(sorted_list)`, which is the correct index for appending the value at the end of the list.
   - If `sorted_list` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will return `len(sorted_list)` as `0`, which correctly represents the insertion point for `value` into an empty list.

4. **Correct Return**: By returning either the index of where the `value` can be inserted or the length of the list, the function meets the requirement of finding the right insertion point in all scenarios.

Thus, the function adheres to the problem description under all valid inputs, ensuring that it correctly locates the insertion point in sorted order. Therefore, the program is correct.
