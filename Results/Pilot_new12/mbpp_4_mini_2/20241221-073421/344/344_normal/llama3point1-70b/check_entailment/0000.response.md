Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Hereâ€™s why:

- It iterates through each element of the `sorted_list`.
- When it finds the first element that is greater than or equal to the `value`, it returns the index of that element, which is the correct insertion point.
- If the loop completes without finding such an element, it returns `len(sorted_list)`, which is also accurate, as this means the `value` is greater than all elements in the list and should be inserted at the end.

All edge cases, such as an empty list or inserting a value smaller than the smallest element or greater than the largest element, are handled correctly. Thus, the function operates as expected for all potential input cases.
