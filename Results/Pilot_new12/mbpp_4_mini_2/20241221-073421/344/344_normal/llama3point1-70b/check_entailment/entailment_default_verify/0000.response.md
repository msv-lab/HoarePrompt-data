Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the function `func_1` based on the problem description and provided output hints. The function is designed to locate the correct insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list and performs this task correctly. 

- It successfully iterates through the `sorted_list` and identifies the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to `value`, which aligns with the expected functionality outlined in the problem description.
- The function also correctly returns `len(sorted_list)` when `value` exceeds all elements in the list, meeting the requirement for handling this case.
- The edge case of an empty list is also correctly managed, as it returns `0`, indicating that there is no other element in the list to compare with. 

Although the function does not handle scenarios where `value` might be non-comparable to the elements of `sorted_list`, the assumption is made that inputs will be valid, which is congruent with the stated conditions. Given these considerations, the function operates as intended for all defined scenarios.
