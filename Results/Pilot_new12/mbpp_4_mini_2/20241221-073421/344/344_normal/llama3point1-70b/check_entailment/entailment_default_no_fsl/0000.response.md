Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately handle all potential edge cases as outlined in the problem description. Specifically, it states that if `value` is less than or equal to all elements in `sorted_list`, it should return `0`. However, the program will return the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to `value`, which would be `0` if `value` is less than the first element but could also return other indices incorrectly. 

Additionally, if `value` is equal to an element in `sorted_list`, the current implementation will correctly return its index. But if `value` is less than every element, it will also correctly return the index `0`, which is redundant given the statement. 

Moreover, the output hints incorrectly suggest that if `value` is less than or equal to all elements, the index should be `0`, while this is only true if the first element is greater than `value` and this condition isn't thoroughly verified against the full sorted list, making it misleading.

There are missing connections with how inequality with all sorted elements is handled. For example, when `sorted_list = [1, 2, 3]` and `value = 0`, the expected result is `0`. This is correctly handled. However, when `sorted_list = [1, 2, 3]` and `value = 4`, it is meant to return `len(sorted_list)`, which is `3`. The program correctly does so by returning `3`, but the logic here is not constructive enough to correctly categorize `0` as a return index when bounds of `value` fall within ranges of `sorted_list`.

Thus, the program does not faithfully execute for all potential edge cases and cannot be considered correct.
