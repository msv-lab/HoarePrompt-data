Explanation: The code correctly identifies the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list, as described in the problem statement. The function iterates through the `sorted_list` and returns the index of the first element that is greater than or equal to `value`. It also handles the edge cases correctly: if `sorted_list` is empty, it returns 0, and if `value` is greater than the largest element in the list, it returns the length of the list. The hints provided align with the behavior described in the code, confirming that the output will be as expected for all valid inputs. 

Correctness: **True**.
