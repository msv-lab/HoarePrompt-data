You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly locates the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Hereâ€™s why:

- It iterates through each element of the `sorted_list`.
- When it finds the first element that is greater than or equal to the `value`, it returns the index of that element, which is the correct insertion point.
- If the loop completes without finding such an element, it returns `len(sorted_list)`, which is also accurate, as this means the `value` is greater than all elements in the list and should be inserted at the end.

All edge cases, such as an empty list or inserting a value smaller than the smallest element or greater than the largest element, are handled correctly. Thus, the function operates as expected for all potential input cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sorted_list`, which is a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order, and a parameter `value`, which is an element that can be compared to the elements in `sorted_list`. It returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`. If `value` is less than or equal to all elements in `sorted_list`, it returns the index `0`. If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, it returns the length of `sorted_list`. If `sorted_list` is empty, the function will return `0` as it does not enter the loop, indicating that there is no element to compare with `value`. The function does not handle cases where `value` might not be comparable to the elements in `sorted_list`, but assumes that comparison is valid.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
