You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order, and value is an element that can be compared to the elements in sorted_list.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order, `value` is an element that can be compared to the elements in `sorted_list`. If `value` is less than or equal to the smallest element in `sorted_list`, the loop will execute up to the length of `sorted_list` with `i` being the last index of the list (i.e., `len(sorted_list) - 1`). If `value` is greater than or equal to the largest element of `sorted_list`, the loop executes completely with no return, and `i` will equal `len(sorted_list)`. If the list is empty, the loop won't execute, and `i` will not be defined.`
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of 'sorted_list', which is the number of comparable elements in the list sorted in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sorted_list`, which is a list of comparable elements sorted in ascending order, and a parameter `value`, which is an element that can be compared to the elements in `sorted_list`. It returns the index of the first element in `sorted_list` that is greater than or equal to `value`. If `value` is less than or equal to all elements in `sorted_list`, it returns the index `0`. If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, it returns the length of `sorted_list`. If `sorted_list` is empty, the function will return `0` as it does not enter the loop, indicating that there is no element to compare with `value`. The function does not handle cases where `value` might not be comparable to the elements in `sorted_list`, but assumes that comparison is valid.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
