Correctness: **False**

The provided program uses `bisect.bisect_right` to find the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. However, it does not handle the scenario where the input list is empty. If an empty list is passed to the function, it will return `0`, which is technically a valid insertion point but could be considered incorrect behavior since it does not align with the problem description which implies the function assumes a non-empty list and finds the right position in sorted order.

For instance, calling `func_1([], 5)` results in `0`, which indicates that `5` would be placed at index 0 of the empty list, but this does not provide a meaningful outcome given that the list has no elements. Other edge cases, like inserting a value thatâ€™s less than or equal to all existing values in the list or greater than all existing values, work as expected, but the empty list scenario is a flaw.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case.
