You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program uses `bisect.bisect_right` to find the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. However, it does not handle the scenario where the input list is empty. If an empty list is passed to the function, it will return `0`, which is technically a valid insertion point but could be considered incorrect behavior since it does not align with the problem description which implies the function assumes a non-empty list and finds the right position in sorted order.

For instance, calling `func_1([], 5)` results in `0`, which indicates that `5` would be placed at index 0 of the empty list, but this does not provide a meaningful outcome given that the list has no elements. Other edge cases, like inserting a value thatâ€™s less than or equal to all existing values in the list or greater than all existing values, work as expected, but the empty list scenario is a flaw.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of sorted integers, and value is an integer that needs to be inserted while maintaining the sorted order.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index at which the integer 'value' can be inserted in 'sorted_list' while maintaining its sorted order, using the bisect_right method from the bisect module.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of sorted integers, `sorted_list`, and an integer, `value`. It utilizes the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to determine the index at which `value` can be inserted into `sorted_list` while maintaining its sorted order. The function returns this index. It correctly handles cases where `value` is less than, equal to, or greater than the elements in `sorted_list`, as well as edge cases such as inserting before the first element or after the last element in the list. It does not modify the input list but rather provides the appropriate insertion index.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
