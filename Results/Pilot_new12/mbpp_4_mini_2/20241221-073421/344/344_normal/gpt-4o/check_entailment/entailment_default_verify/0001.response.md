The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** because it does not handle the case of an empty list correctly. The reasoning suggests that while calling `func_1([], 5)` returns `0`, which is a valid insertion point, it does not align with the intention of the problem description that implies a non-empty list.

The provided output hints clarify the program's functionality and state that it utilizes `bisect.bisect_right` to determine the correct insertion index, which is indeed how the function is designed to operate. The hints also imply that the function correctly handles various cases regarding the relative value of `value` compared to the list elements.

Considering that the problem description does not explicitly state the requirement that the input list must not be empty, and given that the function's behavior in returning `0` in the case of an empty list can be considered a valid action according to the bisect functionality, the original assessment may be overly strict. 

Furthermore, the output hints indicate that it correctly returns the insertion index without modifying the input list and handles a range of input values. This aligns with what is generally expected from a function meant to find insertion points in sorted lists.

Given all these considerations, I believe the original assessment does not accurately reflect the functionality of the program, since it does properly fulfill the essential requirement of providing an insertion index.

Final: **True**
