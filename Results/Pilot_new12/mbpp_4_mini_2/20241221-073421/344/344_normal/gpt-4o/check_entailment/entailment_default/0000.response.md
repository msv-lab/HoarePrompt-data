The program provided makes use of the `bisect` module's `bisect_right` function to determine the correct insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The output hints confirm that the function is expected to handle various scenarios correctly, including cases where the value to be inserted is less than, equal to, or greater than the existing elements in the sorted list.

The `bisect_right` function specifically locates the position where the value can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. Thus, it effectively accounts for:
- Insertion before the first element if the value is smaller than all elements.
- Insertion between existing elements if the value is in between two items in the list.
- Insertion after the last element if the value is larger than all elements.

The assertions at the beginning suggest that the function is tested for cases where:
- The value `6` is greater than all elements, returning index `4`.
- The value `3` is placed between `2` and `4`, returning index `2`.
- The value `7` is greater than all elements still, also returning index `4`.

Given that `func_1` handles all the expected cases described, including edge cases, and does not modify the input list, we can conclude the program meets the requirements as outlined in the problem description without any noted shortcomings.

Correctness: **True**.
