Correctness: **False**.

The function is supposed to locate the right insertion point for the specified value in sorted order. However, using `bisect.bisect_right`, the function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the order, but it may not correctly handle cases where the input `value` is already present in the sorted list.

For example:
- If the sorted list is `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and the value is `4`, the expected right insertion point according to the description should be `3` (the position right after the last occurrence of `4`), but the function will return `2`, which does not satisfy the problem description.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description in certain cases.
