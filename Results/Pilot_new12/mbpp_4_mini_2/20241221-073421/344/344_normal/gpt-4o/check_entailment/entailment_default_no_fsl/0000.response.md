Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that utilizes the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to find the appropriate insertion index for a specified value in a sorted list. The provided assertions verify that the function correctly handles several scenarios:

1. When the value to insert (6) is greater than all elements in the list, it correctly returns the length of the list (4), indicating the position after the last element.
2. When the value to insert (3) lands between existing elements (2 and 4), it correctly returns the index (2) where 3 would fit.
3. When the value (7) is again greater than all elements in the list, it returns the correct insertion point (4).

The output hints confirm that the function is designed to handle cases where the insertion value is less than, equal to, or greater than the existing elements, including potential edge cases, without modifying the original list. Given that the program behaves correctly for all provided cases and aligns with the problem description requirements, the conclusion is that the code is valid in every potential use case provided the input is a valid sorted list and an integer.
