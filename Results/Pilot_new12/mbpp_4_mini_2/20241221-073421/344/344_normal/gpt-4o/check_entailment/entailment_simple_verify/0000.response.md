The problem description requires a function that locates the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The function must return the index where that value can be inserted, keeping the list sorted. The original assessment identified a flaw in the function's logic when it comes to handling cases where the specified value is already present in the list.

The annotated version of the code and the assertions provide further clarity. The function utilizes `bisect.bisect_right`, which correctly finds the insertion point to the right of any existing values. For example, for the sorted list `[1, 2, 4, 5]` and a value of `4`, `bisect.bisect_right` returns `3`, which is the index right after the last occurrence of `4`. 

However, the original assessment states that the function would return `2` in this scenario, which is incorrect. In actuality, the function operates as expected according to the problem description and implementations of the `bisect` module.

The provided assertions confirm the functionâ€™s behavior:
- For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)`, it returns `4`, which is correct since `6` should be placed at the end.
- For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)`, it returns `2`, which correctly places `3` in between `2` and `4`.
- For `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)`, it again returns `4`, placing `7` at the end.

Thus, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is incorrect does not hold true considering the annotations accurately reflect the behavior of the function. Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description and behaves correctly according to the bisect module documentation, the program works as intended.

Final: **True**
