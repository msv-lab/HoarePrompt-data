Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted order.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` takes two argumentsâ€”`sorted_list`, which is a list of sorted integers, and `value`, which is the integer that we want to insert into the list while maintaining the sorted order. This directly addresses the problem's requirement.

2. **Use of bisect Right**: The function utilizes the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module. This method specifically returns the index at which `value` can be inserted in `sorted_list` while maintaining its sorted order. If `value` is equal to some element in the list, it returns the index after the last occurrence of that value, which is indeed the correct insertion point per sorted order requirements.

3. **Edge Cases Handling**: The function correctly handles edge cases:
   - If `value` is less than all elements in the list, it returns index `0`, indicating that `value` should be inserted at the beginning.
   - If `value` is greater than all elements, it returns the length of the list, which is the correct insertion point at the end.
   - For values that need to be inserted among the elements, it gives the appropriate index regardless of whether the value is already present in the list or not.

4. **Assertions Provided**: The provided assertions demonstrate the correctness of the function for various cases:
   - Inserting `6` returns `4`, correctly placing it after the last element `5`.
   - Inserting `3` returns `2`, placing it correctly between `2` and `4`.
   - Inserting `7` again returns `4`, as `7` is greater than all current elements.

Since the function consistently produces the correct results in accordance with the problem description across all tested scenarios, we conclude that the implementation is indeed correct.
