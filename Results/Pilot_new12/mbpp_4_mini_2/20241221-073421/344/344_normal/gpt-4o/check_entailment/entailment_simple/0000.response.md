Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to return the index at which a specified `value` should be inserted into the `sorted_list` to maintain its sorted order.

2. **Use of `bisect_right`**: The function utilizes the `bisect.bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module. This method finds the insertion point in a way that if `value` is equal to an element already present in `sorted_list`, the new `value` will be inserted to the right of the existing element, which aligns with the requirement to insert in sorted order.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions correctly validate that the function resolves its purpose for various inputs:
   - When the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, indicating that it can be inserted at the end.
   - When the value fits between existing elements, it returns the appropriate index where the value would maintain the sorted order.
   - When the value equals an existing element, it correctly identifies the position to the right of the existing element.

Overall, the function handles all the specified conditions for maintaining sorted order, hence it adheres strictly to the problem narrative that requires determining the insertion point effectively for any valid input case defined in the problem description.
