The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it fails to handle cases where the input `value` is already present in the sorted list. It emphasizes that the expected right insertion point for a value that already exists in the list should be after its last occurrence, but according to the assertion examples given, it does not reflect this situation accurately.

The output hints clarify that the function correctly uses `bisect.bisect_right`, which is designed to return the index at which the `value` can be inserted while maintaining the sorted order. This includes cases where the `value` is equal to elements in the list, and it indeed returns the position right after the last occurrence of that value. Hence, in the case of the example provided (`sorted_list = [1, 2, 4, 5]` and `value = 4`), the function would correctly return `3`, which is the position after the last occurrence of `4`. The initial assertion incorrectly reflects the expected behavior of the function.

Based on the explanation above and the output hints confirming the function's behavior is consistent with the requirements to find the appropriate insertion point for a specified value, the original assessment of correctness being **False** is incorrect.

Final: **True**
