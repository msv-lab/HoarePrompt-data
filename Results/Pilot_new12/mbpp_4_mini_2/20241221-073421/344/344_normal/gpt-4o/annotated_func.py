#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of sorted integers, and value is an integer that needs to be inserted while maintaining the sorted order.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the index at which the integer 'value' can be inserted in 'sorted_list' while maintaining its sorted order, using the bisect_right method from the bisect module.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of sorted integers, `sorted_list`, and an integer, `value`. It utilizes the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to determine the index at which `value` can be inserted into `sorted_list` while maintaining its sorted order. The function returns this index. It correctly handles cases where `value` is less than, equal to, or greater than the elements in `sorted_list`, as well as edge cases such as inserting before the first element or after the last element in the list. It does not modify the input list but rather provides the appropriate insertion index.
