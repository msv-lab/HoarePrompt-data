The function accepts a list of sorted integers, `sorted_list`, and an integer, `value`. It utilizes the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to determine the index at which `value` can be inserted into `sorted_list` while maintaining its sorted order. The function returns this index. It correctly handles cases where `value` is less than, equal to, or greater than the elements in `sorted_list`, as well as edge cases such as inserting before the first element or after the last element in the list. It does not modify the input list but rather provides the appropriate insertion index.
