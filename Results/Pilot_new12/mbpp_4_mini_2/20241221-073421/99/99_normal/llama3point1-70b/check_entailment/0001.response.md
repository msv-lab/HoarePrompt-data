Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to remove characters from a string that are located at odd index positions, but it actually does the opposite: it keeps characters at even index positions. This means the program does not fulfill the requirement to remove characters from odd indices.

For example, consider the input string `"abcdef"`:
- The characters at odd indices are: `b`, `d`, and `f` (which are at indices 1, 3, and 5).
- According to the problem description, the expected output for this input should be `"ace"` (after removing `b`, `d`, and `f`).
  
However, the program would return `"ace"` (which it correctly constructs), indicating the "removal" of odd-indexed characters. While it seems to give the correct output for this specific case, the logic in its operation is incorrect relative to the problem statement's requirement. 

By revisiting the problem specification, it's clear that the program is not performing the removal of characters at odd indices, instead it returns the characters at even indices, leading to the conclusion that it does not fulfill the task as defined. 

Hence, the correctness of the function is **False**.
