Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires the function to remove characters with odd index values from a given string, whereas the provided code actually returns every second character starting from index 0 (even index values). This is a misunderstanding of the requirement.

For example, given an input string `"abcdef"`, the expected output (removing characters with odd index values) would be `"ace"`, but the program would return `"ace"` as well, giving the appearance of correctness for this specific example. However, the core logic is flawed because the task stipulates removal of odd-indexed characters rather than selection of even-indexed characters.

Additionally, if we take the example with the string being empty (`""`), both the expected output and the program's output would still correctly return an empty string. 

But fundamentally, since the program's implementation does not align with the problem's expressed requirement of removing characters at odd indices, it is incorrect. 

Therefore, the requirement is not met for every potential case, resulting in an overall faulty logic implementation.

Thus, the program fails to fulfill the task as described.
