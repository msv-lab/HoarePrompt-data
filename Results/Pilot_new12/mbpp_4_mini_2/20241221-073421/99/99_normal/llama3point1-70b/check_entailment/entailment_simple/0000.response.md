Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements laid out in the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` is designed to remove characters from the input string `s` that have odd index values. 

Hereâ€™s why it meets the problem description:

1. The function uses a generator expression `s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)` to iterate over the indices of the string `s`. The range starts at `0` and increments by `2`, thus selecting every character at an even index (0, 2, 4, ...).
  
2. By using `''.join()`, it concatenates these selected characters into a new string.

3. The indices of the string correspond directly to character positions, where even indices refer to characters at positions 0, 2, 4, etc., and odd indices refer to positions 1, 3, 5, etc. Therefore, the function effectively removes all characters located at odd indices.

As such, the function fulfills the requirement to remove characters with odd index values, validating its correctness according to the problem description.
