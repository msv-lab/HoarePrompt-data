Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The given function `func_1` removes characters from the input string `s` that are at odd indices. However, the problem description states that the task is to remove characters which have odd index values. The implementation actually retains characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). The output hints indicate that the function returns every second character from `s`, which is correct for retaining characters from even indices but does not align with the requirement to remove characters at odd indices.

For example, for the input string `'abcdef'`, the expected behavior according to the problem would be to return `'ace'` (removing 'b', 'd', 'f'), but the function returns `'ace'` instead of explicitly removing the odd indexed characters. This misinterpretation of the requirements leads to an inconsistency between the functionality described and the intended task.

Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirement of the problem description for every potential case.
