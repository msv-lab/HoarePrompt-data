#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of characters.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join(s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2))
    #The program returns the string formed by joining every second character from the string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter 's' and returns a new string composed of every second character from 's', starting from the first character. If 's' is empty, the function will return an empty string. The return value will also maintain the order of the characters taken from 's'.
