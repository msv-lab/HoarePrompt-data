The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. It returns a new string that consists of characters from the original string `s` at even indices. If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string as well. The function does not consider any potential types other than strings, so passing in a non-string type (e.g., an integer or a list) would lead to a TypeError.
