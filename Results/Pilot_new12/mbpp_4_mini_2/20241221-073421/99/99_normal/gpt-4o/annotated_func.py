#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of characters.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
    #The program returns a new string consisting of characters from the original string 's' at even indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. It returns a new string that consists of characters from the original string `s` at even indices. If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string as well. The function does not consider any potential types other than strings, so passing in a non-string type (e.g., an integer or a list) would lead to a TypeError.
