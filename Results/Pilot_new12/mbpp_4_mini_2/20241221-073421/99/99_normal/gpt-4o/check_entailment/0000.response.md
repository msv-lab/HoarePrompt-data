Correctness: **True**. 

The provided function `func_1` effectively removes characters from a string that have odd index values. It utilizes a list comprehension that iterates over the length of the string, checking the index of each character. It correctly adds characters with even indices to the result string using `join`. 

The assertions provided show that the function meets the requirements of the problem description for various test cases:

- For 'abcdef', characters at indices 0, 2, and 4 are 'a', 'c', and 'e', resulting in 'ace'.
- For 'python', characters at indices 0, 2, and 4 are 'p', 't', and 'o', resulting in 'pto'.
- For 'data', characters at indices 0 and 2 are 'd' and 't', resulting in 'dt'.
- For 'lambs', characters at indices 0, 2, and 4 are 'l', 'm', and 's', resulting in 'lms'.

All provided test cases are handled correctly, and the logic covers the requirement of removing characters at odd index positions. The function should work correctly for any input string as well, since it handles the string length dynamically. 

Thus, the program is correct according to the problem description.
