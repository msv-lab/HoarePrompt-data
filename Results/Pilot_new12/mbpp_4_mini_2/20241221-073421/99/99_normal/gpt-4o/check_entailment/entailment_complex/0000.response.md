Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements outlined in the problem description, which states to "remove the characters which have odd index values of a given string." Instead, the program retains characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...).

To illustrate the discrepancy:
- Given the input 'abcdef', the characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5) are 'b', 'd', and 'f'. Removing these characters should yield 'ace', which is indeed the correct result for the program's current output. However, instead of following the explicit instruction to remove odd-indexed characters, the program returns a string made up of the even-indexed characters.

Thus, the implementation does not align with the problem's requirement to remove characters at odd indices, leading to an incorrect function description. Therefore, the output should be 'False'.
