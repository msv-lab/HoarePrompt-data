Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description by successfully removing characters that have odd index values from a given string. The logic in the function `func_1(s)` uses list comprehension to build a new string consisting only of characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.). 

Let's review the provided assertions:

- For the input `'abcdef'`, characters at even indices are `'a'`, `'c'`, and `'e'`, resulting in `'ace'`.
- For the input `'python'`, characters at even indices are `'p'`, `'t'`, and `'o'`, resulting in `'pto'`.
- For the input `'data'`, characters at even indices are `'d'` and `'t'`, resulting in `'dt'`.
- For the input `'lambs'`, characters at even indices are `'l'`, `'m'`, and `'s'`, resulting in `'lms'`.

All the test cases provided yield the expected outputs, and I cannot think of any edge cases where the code would fail based on the given description. Therefore, the function correctly fulfills the requirement of removing characters at odd indices.

Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.
