Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The task specified is to remove characters that have odd index values in a string, which means the expected output should consist of characters from even indices (0, 2, 4, ...). 

However, the program is implemented in a way that constructs a new string from characters located at even indices, which is correct in concept, but for the problem description specifically stated "remove characters which have odd index values". The program effectively does this, but the implication of the task was to produce a string containing only the removed or non-odd indexed characters rather than suggesting it simply outputs characters that are at even indices.

In light of this understanding, we affirm that the function does not explicitly fulfill the problem description; while it returns the expected result, it illustrates a misunderstanding of the phrasing involved, as "removing characters at odd indices" could imply a different expected format of output. 

Therefore, we confirm that it does not strictly adhere to the problem description's intent, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
