Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for input cases where the input is not a string. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to remove characters at odd indices from a given string. However, if a non-string type (such as an integer or a list) is passed to the function, it will raise a TypeError when trying to index the input because non-string types may not support the same operations as strings. According to the output hints, this limitation indicates that the program is not universally correct.

For example, if we test the function with an integer input:

```python
func_1(12345)  # This would raise a TypeError since 'int' object is not subscriptable
```

This demonstrates that the program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is deemed incorrect.
