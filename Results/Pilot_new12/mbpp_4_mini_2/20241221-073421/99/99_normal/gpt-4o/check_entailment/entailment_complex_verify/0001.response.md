Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the requirement of removing characters from the input string that have odd index values. The logic in the `func_1` function is sound, utilizing list comprehension to gather characters from even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) and correctly joining them to form the output string. 

The annotations provided confirm this functionality, explicitly stating that the function returns a new string consisting of characters from the original string `s` at even indices. Additionally, the provided assertions yield expected results that match the problem's description, thus further validating the correctness of the function. 

While there is a note about TypeErrors for non-string inputs, the problem description assumes valid input will be provided, which aligns with the assessment that the program is correct under the specified constraints. Therefore, the program meets all requirements outlined in the problem description while also demonstrating the expected behavior according to the annotations.

Thus, the final conclusion is that the program is correct.
