#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of any characters.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of any characters, `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s`, `word` is the last word in `words`. If any `word` of length greater than 1 has 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character, the program returns True; otherwise, the loop finishes executing without returning any value.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that none of the words of length greater than 1 have 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single string parameter `s` and processes it to determine if any word within the string meets specific criteria. It splits the string `s` into a list of words and checks each word to see if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' somewhere in the substring defined by its second to second-to-last characters. If such a word is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If the function goes through all the words without finding any that meet the criteria, it returns `False`. The function does not account for edge cases such as empty strings or strings with only one-character words, but it will handle strings that contain multiple spaces between words correctly by relying on the `split()` method.
