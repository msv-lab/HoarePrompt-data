Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly implement the problem as described. Specifically, while it successfully checks for the presence of 'z' in the middle of words (i.e., between the first and last characters), it does not handle edge cases effectively. 

For instance, consider the input string `s = "zebra is a lazy dog"`. According to the problem description, the letter 'z' appears in the words "zebra" and "lazy," but the implementation will return `False` since "zebra" starts with 'z' and is thus excluded, and "lazy" contains 'z' but is also excluded because it starts and ends with 'l' and 'y', respectively.

Moreover, the function does not handle single-character words correctlyâ€”if the input is `"z"`, it does not check whether 'z' is present since there's no valid second to second-to-last character substring.

Therefore, due to these issues, the function is incorrect.
