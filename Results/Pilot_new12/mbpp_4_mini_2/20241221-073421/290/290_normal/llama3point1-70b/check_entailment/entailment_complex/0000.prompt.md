You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of any characters.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string consisting of any characters, `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s`, `word` is the last word in `words`. If any `word` of length greater than 1 has 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character, the program returns True; otherwise, the loop finishes executing without returning any value.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that none of the words of length greater than 1 have 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single string parameter `s` and processes it to determine if any word within the string meets specific criteria. It splits the string `s` into a list of words and checks each word to see if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' somewhere in the substring defined by its second to second-to-last characters. If such a word is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If the function goes through all the words without finding any that meet the criteria, it returns `False`. The function does not account for edge cases such as empty strings or strings with only one-character words, but it will handle strings that contain multiple spaces between words correctly by relying on the `split()` method.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
