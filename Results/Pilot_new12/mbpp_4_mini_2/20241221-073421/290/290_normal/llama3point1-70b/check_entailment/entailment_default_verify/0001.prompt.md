You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program checks whether a string contains the character 'z' in any word except at the start and end. However, it incorrectly returns `True` for the first word that meets the condition without verifying all words.

For example, consider the input string `"z apple za"`. The program would return `False` because the first word `"z"` does not meet the condition, and it does not check the second word `"apple"` which does not contain 'z' either, but it skips checking the last word `"za"` after finding that only the first word doesn't meet the condition.

Here's the breakdown of the problematic input:

- Input string: `"z apple za"`
- Expected output: `False` (there's no 'z' in the middle of any words)
- Actual output from the program: `False`

However, if there were a word like `"quiz"`, the program would return `True` prematurely without considering other words in the string.

This indicates that the code does not properly evaluate all words in the input string to determine if any contain 'z' in the middle. 

Thus, the logic is not comprehensive, and the code fails in situations where relevant words might be after the first word found, leading to incorrect output given certain inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a single string parameter `s` and processes it to determine if any word within the string meets specific criteria. It splits the string `s` into a list of words and checks each word to see if it has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' somewhere in the substring defined by its second to second-to-last characters. If such a word is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If the function goes through all the words without finding any that meet the criteria, it returns `False`. The function does not account for edge cases such as empty strings or strings with only one-character words, but it will handle strings that contain multiple spaces between words correctly by relying on the `split()` method.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
