To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program and the task.

Problem description: Write a function that checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

Program:
```python
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False
```

### Analysis:
1. The function first splits the input string `s` into words using `s.split()`.
2. It then iterates over each word in the list of words.
3. For each word, it checks:
   - If the length of the word is greater than 1 (to ensure there is a character between the start and the end).
   - If the character 'z' is found in the slice of the word excluding the first and last characters (`word[1:-1]`).
4. If both conditions are true, the function returns `True`.
5. If no such word is found after checking all words, the function returns `False`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- A string with only one character (e.g., "z") should return `False`, which is correct.
- A string with 'z' at the start and end (e.g., "zexamplez") should return `False`, which is correct.
- A string without any words (e.g., "") should return `False`, which is correct.
- A string with a single word without 'z' (e.g., "example") should return `False`, which is correct.
- A string with 'z' in the middle (e.g., "exaZmp") should return `True`, which is correct because 'Z' (in any case) would be checked too.

To find a potential failure case:
- Consider the case where there is an adjacent character 'z' in the middle of a word:
  e.g., if `s = "no z here"`, the expected output should be `False` since 'z' is at the second position and should not count.
 
In any case where there is a valid 'z' in the middle of a word (like "Hezlo"), it will return `True`, which is as per the requirement.

After examining various edge cases, we can conclude that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly identifies if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of any word.
