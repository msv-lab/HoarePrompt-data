Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is designed to check if any word in the input string `s` contains the character 'z' (not considering occurrences at the start and the end of the word). However, it contains an issue where it returns `True` immediately upon finding the first valid word, which may lead to incorrect conclusions in the presence of other words that might contain 'z'.

For example, consider the input string `" a z b"`. In this case:
- The function will split the string and analyze the words: `["a", "z", "b"]`.
- The word "a" has a length of 1 and is skipped.
- The word "z" also has a length of 1 and is skipped.
- The word "b" has a length of 1 and is skipped.

Thus, it returns `False`, which is correct. 

However, in another case, it can yield unexpected results, such as in the input string `"here is a bz test z"`:
- The words are `["here", "is", "a", "bz", "test", "z"]`.
- It checks "here" (no 'z'), "is" (no 'z'), "a" (no 'z'), "bz" (valid but would return True immediately), and "test" (no 'z').
- Due to the logic used, it will not investigate other possibilities or other words on finding 'bz', which can lead to cases where the string might contain 'z' elsewhere missed.

Additionally, it doesn't account for multiple spaces or punctuation marks potentially acting as boundaries for the `split()`. Although relying on the `split()` method does handle extra spaces adequately, overall, the program fails in various situations as demonstrated.

Thus, we conclude that the function does not cover all potential cases and has a flaw in its logic.
