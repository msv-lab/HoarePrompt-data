Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with at least 1 character, `words` is a list containing at least 2 words, and `word` is the second word in `words`. If the length of `word` is greater than 1 and 'z' is present in `word` (excluding the first and last characters), the program returns True. If not, there is no return value.***
