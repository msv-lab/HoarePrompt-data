Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of any characters, `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s`, `word` is the last word in `words`. If any `word` of length greater than 1 has 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character, the program returns True; otherwise, the loop finishes executing without returning any value.**
