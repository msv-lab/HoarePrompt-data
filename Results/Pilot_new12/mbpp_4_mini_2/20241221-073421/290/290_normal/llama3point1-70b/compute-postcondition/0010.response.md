Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with at least 1 character, `words` is a list containing at least 3 words, and `word` is the third word in `words`. If the length of `word` is greater than 1 and 'z' is present in the substring of `word` from the second character to the second-to-last character, the program returns True; otherwise, the program performs no action.***
