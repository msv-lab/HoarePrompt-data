According to the code, the loop iterates over each word in the list `words`. Since the program needs to execute the loop one more time, we need to evaluate how many iterations have occurred and what the conditions are for the loop to proceed. 

The variable `word` represents the second word in the list, and if it has been selected in the last iteration, we can determine that we are currently on the second index (index 1). For the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `words` has at least 3 words left to iterate. 

As we know that the loop progresses with each iteration to the next word in the list, after the last iteration, `word` will become the next word in sequence. If we consider that `word` is currently the second word, which is at index 1 in `words`, for the loop to be able to execute again, we will now want `word` to point to the third word in the list if there is one. 

Thus, if `word` is currently the second word, we will increment our index to 2, making `word` the third element in the list. Furthermore, for the loop to be executed at least once more, we must ensure there are at least 3 words in total in `words`.

State: **`s` is a string with at least 1 character, `words` is a list containing at least 3 words, `word` is the third word in `words`.**
