According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `words` list. If the `words` list contains at least 1 word obtained from splitting the string `s`, then the loop can execute. 

At the end of the last iteration, `word` would represent the last word in the `words` list if the loop was executed. Thus, for the loop to be executed, the string `s` must contain at least 1 character (to ensure there is at least one word after splitting) and `words` should be a non-empty list. On the first iteration, `word` would be the first word in the `words` list.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of any characters that must contain at least 1 character, `words` is a list of words obtained by splitting `s` that must contain at least 1 word, `word` is the first word in the `words` list**
