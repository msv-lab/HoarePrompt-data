Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks if the letter 'z' is present in the substring of the input string `s` from the second character to the second-to-last character. This behavior directly aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the function must determine whether the string contains 'z' except at the start and end of the word.

The logic of the code is as follows:
1. It uses slicing with `s[1:-1]` to create a substring, effectively excluding the first and last characters of the string.
2. It checks if 'z' is present in that substring with the condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1])`. 
3. If 'z' is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The function operates correctly for various scenarios:
- For a string of length less than 3, the substring derived from `s[1:-1]` will be empty, thus satisfying the requirement of not containing 'z'. 
- The assertions in the code showcase various tests that confirm the function behaves as expected across different inputs.

Therefore, since the program meets the requirements specified by the problem description for all possible valid inputs, it is deemed correct.
