Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not handle the edge case of empty strings or strings with length less than 3 characters correctly. For an empty string, calling `func_1('')` would indeed raise an `IndexError` due to the slicing operation `s[1:-1]`, which assumes that the string has sufficient length. According to the problem description, the function should return `False` for such cases, aligning with the intention of excluding 'z' at the start and end of the word. Since it does not handle this case properly, the program does not fulfill the requirements for all potential inputs as specified in the original assessment.
