The provided function `func_1` checks for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring formed by excluding the first and last characters of the input string `s`. According to the problem description, it is essential that we check whether 'z' is present in the string, but it cannot be at the start or the end of the word.

Here's the step-by-step evaluation of the function based on the given description and output hints:

1. The function utilizes slicing (`s[1:-1]`) to obtain the substring from the second character up to (but not including) the last character. 
2. It checks if 'z' is in this substring:
    - If found, it returns `True`.
    - If not found, it returns `False`.

The output hints mention that edge cases involving strings of less than three characters (i.e., characters 0, 1, or 2 length) will always yield an empty substring. Consequently, the call to check for 'z' in such cases will not be effective. 

For example:
- Calling `func_1('z')` would evaluate to `False` since the substring is empty.
- Calling `func_1('a')` would also evaluate to `False` for the same reason.
- Similarly, for a string like `'ab'`, it would return `False` as well.

These insights illustrate that the current implementation does not address these cases in line with the problem description, as the function must explicitly handle strings of length less than 3; hence it implicitly assumes that all inputs will be of sufficient length.

Given these observations, it is evident that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem in every potential case.

Therefore, the answer is:

Correctness: **False**.
