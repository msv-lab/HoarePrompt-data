Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is supposed to check if the string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. However, it does not handle edge cases where the string length is less than 3 characters. For such cases, the substring created by `s[1:-1]` will be empty and therefore will always return `False`, which fails the requirements of the problem. 

For example, if the input is `'zz'` (length of 2), `s[1:-1]` gives an empty string, leading to the function returning `False`. The correct behavior for this case should be to return `False` since there cannot be a 'z' in the middle of the string when there are no characters present. Another case is an empty string `''`, which should also return `False`.

Thus, because the function does not appropriately handle these potential edge cases, it is incorrect.
