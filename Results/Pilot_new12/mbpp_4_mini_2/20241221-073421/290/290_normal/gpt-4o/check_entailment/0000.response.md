Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the edge case where the input string is empty. If we call `func_1('')`, it will raise an `IndexError` due to the slicing operation `s[1:-1]`. According to the problem description, the function should not return anything (or return `False`) in this case, since an empty string does not contain 'z' at a position that is not the start or end. Therefore, the function does not fulfill the requirements for all potential inputs.
