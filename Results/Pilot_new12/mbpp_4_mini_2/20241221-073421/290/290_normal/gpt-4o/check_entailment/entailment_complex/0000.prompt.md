You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True
assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False
assert func_1('  lang  .') == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if ('z' in s[1:-1]) :
        return True
        #The program returns True, since the substring of 's' from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the character 'z'.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, and the substring of `s` from the second character to the second-to-last character does not contain the letter 'z'.
    return False
    #The program returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and checks whether the substring of `s` from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the letter 'z'. It returns `True` if 'z' is present in that substring; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the string is too short (less than 3 characters), as in such cases the substring will be empty and will always return `False`. Thus, the function may not handle inputs that are strings of length 0, 1, or 2 explicitly, which leads to an implicit assumption that valid inputs should be strings of at least length 3.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
