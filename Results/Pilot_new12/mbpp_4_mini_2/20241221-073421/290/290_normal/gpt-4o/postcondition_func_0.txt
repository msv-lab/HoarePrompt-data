The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and checks whether the substring of `s` from the second character to the second-to-last character contains the letter 'z'. It returns `True` if 'z' is present in that substring; otherwise, it returns `False`. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the string is too short (less than 3 characters), as in such cases the substring will be empty and will always return `False`. Thus, the function may not handle inputs that are strings of length 0, 1, or 2 explicitly, which leads to an implicit assumption that valid inputs should be strings of at least length 3.
