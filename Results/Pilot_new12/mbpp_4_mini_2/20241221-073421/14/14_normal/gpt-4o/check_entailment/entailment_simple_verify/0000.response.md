Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to identify whether there are duplicate integers in the given list `arr`. It initializes a set to keep track of the integers seen as it iterates through the list. If a number is already in the set, it immediately returns `True`, indicating a duplicate. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

The annotations provided further clarify that the state of the variables at key points in the program support this logic. The program clearly handles the cases described in the problem statement effectively, as the test cases validate scenarios with no duplicates, one duplicate, and multiple duplicates. Given the coverage of these scenarios and the absence of any unhandled edge cases under the assumption of valid input, the assessment of correctness stands confirmed.
