Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list may contain non-integer values. According to the problem description, the function is expected to find duplicates among integers in an array. If the input array were to include non-integer types (e.g., strings or floats), it could lead to unexpected behavior or errors. For example, if the array is `[1, 2, '3', 4]`, the program would incorrectly try to check for duplicates between integers and a string, potentially causing issues. Therefore, since the program does not address this case and is assumed to only handle lists of integers, it does not meet the requirement for every potential case as described.
