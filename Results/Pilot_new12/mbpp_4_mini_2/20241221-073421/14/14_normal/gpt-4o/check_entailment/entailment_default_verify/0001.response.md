Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic necessary to determine if there are duplicates in the given array of integers. It initializes a set to track seen integers, iterates through the input list, and efficiently checks for duplicates, returning `True` when a duplicate is found, and `False` if the loop completes without finding any.

The output hints clarify that the function is designed to handle lists of integers and explicitly indicates that if the input is empty, the function will return `False`, which aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the problem description. The hints also confirm that there are no assumptions about invalid inputs since the problem specifies the input will be valid.

Therefore, based on all the information provided, the program meets the problem description, and the assertions validate its correctness.
