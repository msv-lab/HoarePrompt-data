Correctness: **True**

The given program accurately implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to determine whether there are any duplicate elements in an array of integers. Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(arr)` correctly takes a parameter `arr` that is expected to be a list of integers.

2. **Checking for Duplicates**:
   - It initializes an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the integers that have been encountered as it iterates through the list.
   - For each integer (`num`) in `arr`, it checks if `num` is already in the `seen` set:
     - If it is found, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate exists.
     - If it is not found, the integer is added to the `seen` set for future reference.
  
3. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicates (meaning all integers were unique), the function returns `False`, indicating there are no duplicates in `arr`.

4. **Valid Inputs**: The assumption that the input will always be valid (a list of integers) means that the function does not have to handle the cases where the input might be of incorrect types. This aligns with the conditions provided in the task.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles an empty list: since the loop does not execute, it will return `False`, which is expected behavior as there cannot be duplicates in an empty list.

6. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions further confirm that the function works correctly for the specified cases, confirming:
   - No duplicates in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` results in `False`.
   - Presence of a duplicate in `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]` results in `True`.
   - Presence of duplicates in `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]` results in `True`.

Therefore, the program implements the requirements of the problem description correctly and handles the necessary logic to determine the presence of duplicates, adhering to the expected input conditions. As a result, it is concluded to be correct.
