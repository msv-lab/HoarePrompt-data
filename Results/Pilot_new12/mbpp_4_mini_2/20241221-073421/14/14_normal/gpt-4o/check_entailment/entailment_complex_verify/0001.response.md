Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the problem description, which is to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element. The annotated version of the program supports this conclusion by clearly stating how `func_1` processes the input list, maintains a set of seen integers, and identifies duplicates through direct checks against this set. 

The assertions provided demonstrate the function's accuracy across varied test cases, confirming that:
- A list with all unique integers returns `False` (no duplicates),
- A list with duplicates correctly returns `True`,
- A list with multiple duplicates returns `True`.

Furthermore, the annotations specify that the function handles the expected input type correctly (a list of integers) and describes the internal state of the function before and after the loop execution. 

Given all this analysis aligns with the original assessment stating the function's correctness, the final assessment should affirm that the function behaves as intended per the problem description.
