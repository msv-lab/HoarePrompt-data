Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description by accurately determining whether any duplicate elements exist in the given array of integers. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts an array of integers (as stated in the problem description). It processes this input correctly as assumed.

2. **Logic to Detect Duplicates**:
   - The function initializes an empty set called `seen`.
   - It iterates through each integer in the input array `arr`.
   - For each integer `num`, it checks if `num` is already present in the `seen` set.
   - If it is found, the program returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate exists.
   - If `num` is not found in `seen`, it adds `num` to the `seen` set.
   - If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it reaches the return statement and returns `False`, indicating that there are no duplicates in the array.

3. **Test Cases**: 
   - The three assertions at the start validate the correctness of the function:
     - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `False`, which is correct since there are no duplicates.
     - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])` returns `True`, which is correct as the number 4 appears twice.
     - `func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5])` returns `True`, accurately reflecting the presence of duplicates.

Given these points, the program correctly adheres to the problem description of identifying duplicate elements in an array of integers. Thus, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
