Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether there are duplicate elements in the given array of integers. The logic implemented in the program uses a set to track numbers that have been seen as it iterates through the array. If a number is found in the set, it indicates that the number is a duplicate, and the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, it returns `False`.

The provided test cases correctly cover scenarios with no duplicates (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), one duplicate (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`), and multiple duplicates (`[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`).

Since there are no edge cases missed and all functionality described in the problem statement is validly addressed, the program is considered correct.
