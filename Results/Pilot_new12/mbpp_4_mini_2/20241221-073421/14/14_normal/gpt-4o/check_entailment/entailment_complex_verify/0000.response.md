Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` effectively checks for duplicates in the provided list of integers by utilizing a set to track seen numbers. The annotations confirm that the function will only return `True` upon encountering a duplicate, and it will correctly return `False` if no duplicates exist or if the input list is empty. The function is well-aligned with the problem description, handling the required functionality without errors under the assumption of valid input types. The provided test cases further support the correctness of the implementation, covering scenarios with no duplicates, a single duplicate, and multiple duplicates. The logic is sound and meets the requirement to identify duplicates within the list.
