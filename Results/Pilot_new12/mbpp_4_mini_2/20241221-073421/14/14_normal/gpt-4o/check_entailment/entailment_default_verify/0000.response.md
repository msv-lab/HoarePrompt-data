Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately determines that the program correctly identifies whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements. The function `func_1` operates as expected based on the problem description: it utilizes a set to track seen numbers, which allows it to efficiently identify duplicates. The provided test cases comprehensively cover various scenarios pertinent to the problem statement.

Moreover, the output hints confirm that the function behaves correctly given valid input (a list of integers). It specifies that the function will return `True` upon encountering a duplicate and `False` if none are found or the list is emptyâ€”this aligns with the functionality of the implemented logic.

Thus, the assessment of correctness remains intact as the function meets the outlined expectations, confirming that the provided solution satisfies the problem requirements.
