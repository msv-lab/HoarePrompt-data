Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` correctly determines if there are any duplicate elements in the provided array of integers. The logic works as follows:

1. It initializes an empty set called `seen` to keep track of the unique numbers encountered.
2. It iterates through each number in the input array `arr`.
3. For each number, it checks if it has already been added to the `seen` set:
   - If the number is found in `seen`, it indicates a duplicate, and the function returns `True`.
   - If the number is not found in `seen`, it is added to the set.
4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`.

The provided assertions cover various cases:
- An input of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` has no duplicates and correctly returns `False`.
- An input of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]` has a duplicate (`4`) and correctly returns `True`.
- An input of `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]` has multiple duplicates (`1`, `2`, and `4`) and correctly returns `True`.

Since all potential cases considered (including edge cases like an array with only unique elements or multiple duplicates) are handled correctly, the implementation meets the problem description fully without missing any logic. Therefore, the correctness assessment is **True**.
