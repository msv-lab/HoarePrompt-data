The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It checks for the presence of duplicate integers within the list. If a duplicate integer is found, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that duplicates exist. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, or if `arr` is empty, the function returns `False`, indicating there are no duplicates in the list. Thus, the final state of the program after completion will either be `True`, if at least one duplicate was encountered, or `False`, if all integers were unique or the list was empty. The function does not handle non-integer inputs or non-list types but strictly processes it assuming `arr` is a list of integers.
