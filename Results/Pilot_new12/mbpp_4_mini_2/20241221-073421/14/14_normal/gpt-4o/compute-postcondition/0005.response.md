The code adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. The initial state indicates that `num` is the first integer in the list `arr`, and importantly, `num` is not in the set `seen` prior to the execution of this code. After executing `seen.add(num)`, the value of `seen` will now include `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers that has at least 1 integer; `seen` contains the integer `num`; `num` is the first integer in `arr` and is not in `seen` before the operation.**
