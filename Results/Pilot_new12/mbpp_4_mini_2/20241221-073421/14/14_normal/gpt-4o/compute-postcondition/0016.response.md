The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, the following cases may occur: 

- If the integer `num` is found in the set `seen`, the function returns `True`.
- If the integer `num`, which is the second integer in the list `arr`, is found in `seen`, the function returns `True`.
- If the integer `num`, which is the third integer in the list `arr`, has been included in `seen`, the function returns `True`.
- If there are no duplicates in the list `arr` or if `arr` is empty, the function returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return `True` if there are duplicates in the list, reflecting the presence of any integer in the set of seen numbers; otherwise, it returns `False` if the list is empty or contains no duplicates. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, which is a list of integers, and returns True if there are duplicates in the list. If there are no duplicates or the list is empty, it returns False.**
