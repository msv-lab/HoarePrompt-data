According to the code, the loop iterates over each integer in `arr`. If `arr` has at least 1 integer, the loop can execute again for the next integer. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` contains at least 1 integer, `seen` contains the integer `num`, and `num` is the first integer in `arr` that was not previously in `seen`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be updated to the next integer in `arr`, and we need to ensure that `seen` includes this new `num`. Since `num` was the first integer in the list, we need to adjust `num` to point to the second integer in `arr`, and `seen` must contain this new `num`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that has at least 2 integers, `seen` contains the integer `num` and the second integer in `arr`, `num` is the second integer in the list**
