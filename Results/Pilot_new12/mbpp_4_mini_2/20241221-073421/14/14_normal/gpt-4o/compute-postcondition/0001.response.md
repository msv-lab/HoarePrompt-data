According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. For the loop to execute, the list must contain at least one integer. At the end of the last iteration, the state of `seen` will reflect the integers that have been processed, but this is not relevant for the loop's first execution. Thus, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `arr` has at least 1 integer, and `num` should be the first integer in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `seen` is an empty set, `num` is the first integer in `arr`**
