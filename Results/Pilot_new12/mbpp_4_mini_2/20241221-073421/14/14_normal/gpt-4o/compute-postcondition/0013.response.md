The code `seen.add(num)` adds the integer `num` to the set `seen`. Since `num` is already included in `seen` by the initial state, it remains unchanged after the addition. No variables are affected other than the fact that `num` is now explicitly included in the set `seen`. The function itself does not return a value at this point. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers containing at least 3 integers; `seen` includes the integer `num`; `seen` still includes `num`.**
