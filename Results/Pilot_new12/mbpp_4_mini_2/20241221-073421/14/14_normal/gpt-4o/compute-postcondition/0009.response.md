The `seen` variable has been modified by adding `num` to it. As a result, `num` now exists within the `seen` set. The other variables remain unaffected by this execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers containing at least 2 integers, `seen` now includes the integer `num`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers containing at least 2 integers, `seen` now includes the integer `num`.**
