Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers; `seen` is a set containing all unique integers from `arr` that were processed; if `arr` contains duplicates, the loop will return True, and `num` will be the first duplicate integer found in `arr`. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `seen` will remain an empty set.**
