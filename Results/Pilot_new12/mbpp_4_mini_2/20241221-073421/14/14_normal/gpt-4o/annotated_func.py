#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        
        seen.add(num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of integers; `seen` is a set containing all unique integers from `arr` that were processed; if `arr` contains duplicates, the loop will return True, and `num` will be the first duplicate integer found in `arr`. If `arr` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `seen` will remain an empty set.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that there are no duplicates in the list `arr` or that `arr` is empty.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `arr`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It checks for the presence of duplicate integers within the list. If a duplicate integer is found, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating that duplicates exist. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, or if `arr` is empty, the function returns `False`, indicating there are no duplicates in the list. Thus, the final state of the program after completion will either be `True`, if at least one duplicate was encountered, or `False`, if all integers were unique or the list was empty. The function does not handle non-integer inputs or non-list types but strictly processes it assuming `arr` is a list of integers.
