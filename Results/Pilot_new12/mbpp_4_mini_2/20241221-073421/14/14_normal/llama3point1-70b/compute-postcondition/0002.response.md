Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks for duplicates within the list. It returns `True` if there are duplicates (i.e., if the number of unique integers in `arr` is less than the total number of integers in `arr`), and `False` if all integers in `arr` are unique. The function effectively identifies the presence of duplicates but does not handle cases where `arr` is empty; however, in such a case, it would return `False` as expected since no duplicates exist in an empty list. The function directly evaluates the comparison between the length of the original list and the length of the set created from it, thereby making the check efficient and straightforward.**
