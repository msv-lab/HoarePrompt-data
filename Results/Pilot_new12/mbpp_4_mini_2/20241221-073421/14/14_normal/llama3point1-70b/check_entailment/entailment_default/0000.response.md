Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks for duplicate elements in the input list `arr`. It compares the length of the original array with the length of the set created from that array. The set automatically removes duplicates, so if the lengths differ, it indicates that there were duplicates in the original list. As noted in the output hints, if the input list `arr` is empty, the function will return `False`, which is correct since an empty list can't have duplicates. Therefore, the implementation correctly handles all potential cases described in the problem statement.
