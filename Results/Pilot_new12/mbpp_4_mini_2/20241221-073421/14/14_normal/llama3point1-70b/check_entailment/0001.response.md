Correctness: **False**

The program incorrectly returns `True` if there are any duplicates in the array, but according to the problem description, it should return `True` if there are duplicates and `False` otherwise. The current implementation returns `True` when duplicates are found (since `len(arr) != len(set(arr))` becomes `True`) which is the opposite of what the description implies.

For example, for the input `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, the program would return `False` (no duplicates), which is correct. However, for the input `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, the program would incorrectly return `True` (indicating there are no duplicates). 

This inconsistency with the expected behavior based on the problem statement leads to the conclusion that the program does not fulfill the requirements in all cases.
