You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the length of the list 'arr' is not equal to the length of the set created from 'arr', which checks for the presence of duplicate integers in 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and checks for duplicates within the list. It returns `True` if there are duplicates (i.e., if the number of unique integers in `arr` is less than the total number of integers in `arr`), and `False` if all integers in `arr` are unique. The function effectively identifies the presence of duplicates but does not handle cases where `arr` is empty; however, in such a case, it would return `False` as expected since no duplicates exist in an empty list. The function directly evaluates the comparison between the length of the original list and the length of the set created from it, thereby making the check efficient and straightforward.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
