Correctness: **False**. 

The function is intended to identify whether an array contains duplicate elements by returning `True` if there are duplicates and `False` otherwise. However, the implementation returns `True` when there are duplicates and `False` when there are none. 

For example, for the input `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, the expected output should be `False` (no duplicates present), but the function would return `True` instead:

```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Expected output: False, Actual output: True
```

This logic flaw indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
