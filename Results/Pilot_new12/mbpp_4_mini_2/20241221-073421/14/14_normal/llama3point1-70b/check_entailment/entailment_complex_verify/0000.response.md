The program `func_1` is intended to determine whether an array of integers contains any duplicate elements, returning `True` for duplicates and `False` otherwise. The annotated version of the code clarifies that the function indeed checks for duplicates by comparing the lengths of the original list and a set created from that list.

The original assessment states that the correctness is **False** because the expected functionality of returning `False` when there are no duplicates and `True` when duplicates are present is inverted in the function's logic. Upon review of the annotated code, it confirms that the original function does indeed return `True` when duplicates are found (i.e., when the length of the list is not equal to the length of the set), which corresponds to the expected behavior.

Thus, the original assessment is accurate, as it correctly identifies the logical error in the program. The function's behavior does not match the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Final: **False**
