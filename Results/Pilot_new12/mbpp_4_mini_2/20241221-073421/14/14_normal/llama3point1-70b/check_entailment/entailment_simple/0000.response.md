Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to check for duplicate integers in a given list. However, the implementation contains an error in the return statement. The program returns `True` when duplicates are present (since `len(arr)` will be greater than `len(set(arr))`), and it returns `False` when there are no duplicates (since `len(arr)` will be equal to `len(set(arr))`). 

According to the problem description, the function should indicate whether a duplicate element exists in the array. The expected behavior is that the function should return `True` if duplicates are found and `False` if they are not. The current implementation reverses this logic, thus failing to satisfy the correct requirements set forth in the problem description. 

For example:
- For the input `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]` (no duplicates), the function returns `False` (which is incorrect).
- For the input `arr = [1, 2, 2, 4]` (with duplicates), the function returns `True` (which is correct).

Therefore, the function does not correctly follow the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the overall correctness is **False**.
