Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether there are any duplicate integers in a list `arr`. 

1. It first converts the list `arr` into a set using `set(arr)`, which inherently eliminates any duplicate values because a set cannot contain duplicate elements.
2. It then compares the length of the original list (`len(arr)`) with the length of the set (`len(set(arr))`). 
   - If the lengths are not equal, this indicates that there were duplicates in the list (because duplicates would reduce the number of unique items in the set), and the function returns `True`.
   - If the lengths are equal, it means that all items in the list are unique, and the function returns `False`.

Additionally, as noted in the annotations, the function handles the case of an empty list by returning `False`, since there are no duplicates in an empty list. 

Overall, the function meets the requirements of the problem description effectively, as it accurately determines the presence of duplicates in the provided list of integers.
