Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly identifies whether an array of integers contains duplicate elements by comparing the length of the original list with the length of the set created from it. The set inherently does not allow duplicates, so if there are any duplicates in the list, the length of the set will be less than that of the original list, and the function will return `True`. Conversely, if there are no duplicates, the lengths will be equal, and the function will return `False`. 

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, including handling an empty array correctly by returning `False`. Since the hints also state that the input will be valid, there is no need to consider any invalid inputs. The function efficiently checks for duplicates in every scenario outlined in the problem description.
