Final: **False**

The original assessment remains accurate based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` is intended to remove lowercase substrings from the input string `s`, but its implementation only extracts and returns uppercase characters. The annotations confirm that `result` will only contain uppercase letters, ignoring lowercase substrings completely.

The assessment correctly identifies that the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. For instance, the expected behavior for an input such as "Hello World" should yield "H W" (removing lowercase characters), while the function instead outputs "HW". This indicates a failure on the program's part to fulfill the core requirement. Thus, the conclusion that the program is incorrect is well justified.
