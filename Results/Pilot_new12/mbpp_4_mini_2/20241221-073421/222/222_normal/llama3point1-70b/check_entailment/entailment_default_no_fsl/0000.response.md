Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but instead, it only extracts uppercase characters while ignoring lowercase characters completely. The problem description specifically asks for the removal of lowercase substrings, which implies that any segment of the string containing lowercase letters should be removed entirely, not just the omission of lowercase characters. 

For example, for the input string "HelloWorld", the expected behavior would be to return "HelloW" and remove "orld," but the function instead returns "HW," which is not compliant with the problem statement. Specifically, the code fails to address how to deal with lowercase substrings as requested.

Additionally, the output hints do not provide a coherent explanation of the purpose of the code since they describe a function that simply extracts uppercase characters rather than addressing the removal of lowercase substrings, thereby diverging from the intended functionality. 

Thus, as the logic of the program does not align with the requirements outlined in the problem description, it is fundamentally incorrect.
