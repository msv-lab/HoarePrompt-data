You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the problem description, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the function `func_1` only accumulates uppercase characters from the input string `s` while ignoring everything else, including lowercase characters and any other characters (like digits or punctuation).

For example, given the input string "Hello World", the expected behavior would be to remove lowercase substrings and return "H W" (or a similar representation if spaces should also be considered). However, the function instead returns "HW", which is not what is required.

Additionally, if the input string were to be "abcDef", the expected output would be "D" (removing lowercase "abc" and "ef"), but the function would return "D" in this case, which occasionally matches the output we expect. However, the function fails to consider these cases consistently and completely fails when lowercases are sandwiched by upper case letters with specific behavior.

Therefore, since the program does not correctly implement the requirement to handle lowercase substrings appropriately, it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing all uppercase characters from `s` in the order they appeared. The function does not modify the original string `s`. If `s` contains no uppercase characters, the function will return an empty string. Additionally, the function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases such as non-string inputs or other types of characters.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
