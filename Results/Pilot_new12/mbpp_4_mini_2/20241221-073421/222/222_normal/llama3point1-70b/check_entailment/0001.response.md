Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the problem description, which is to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the function `func_1` only accumulates uppercase characters from the input string `s` while ignoring everything else, including lowercase characters and any other characters (like digits or punctuation).

For example, given the input string "Hello World", the expected behavior would be to remove lowercase substrings and return "H W" (or a similar representation if spaces should also be considered). However, the function instead returns "HW", which is not what is required.

Additionally, if the input string were to be "abcDef", the expected output would be "D" (removing lowercase "abc" and "ef"), but the function would return "D" in this case, which occasionally matches the output we expect. However, the function fails to consider these cases consistently and completely fails when lowercases are sandwiched by upper case letters with specific behavior.

Therefore, since the program does not correctly implement the requirement to handle lowercase substrings appropriately, it is incorrect.
