Explanation: The code correctly implements a function that iterates through the string and appends only uppercase characters to the result string. The output hints clearly state that the function returns a new string containing all uppercase characters in their original order and does not modify the original string. Additionally, it states that if there are no uppercase characters, the function will return an empty string.

However, the problem description specifically mentions "remove lowercase substrings from a given string", implying that the function should also consider the removal of lowercase characters specifically, rather than just collecting uppercase characters. The hints imply that the function does not account for lowercase characters at all and entirely focuses on uppercase ones. Hence, it does not fulfill the requirement to "remove lowercase substrings".

Correctness: **False**.
