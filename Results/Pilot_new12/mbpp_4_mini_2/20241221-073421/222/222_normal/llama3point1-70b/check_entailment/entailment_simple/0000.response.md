Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided program only retains uppercase characters and ignores lowercase characters. 

Specifically, the program iterates through each character in the input string `s` and checks if each character is uppercase. If it is, the character is added to the `result` string. This means that all lowercase characters are effectively removed from the output, but the program does not handle the requirement of "removing lowercase substrings" as a coherent entity; rather, it simply filters out individual lowercase letters without addressing the concept of substrings. 

Thus, it does not fulfill the problem requirement to handle substrings as a whole. The definition of "removing lowercase substrings" implies that if a sequence of lowercase letters appears in the input string, that entire sequence should be excluded from the output, which the program fails to implement correctly.
