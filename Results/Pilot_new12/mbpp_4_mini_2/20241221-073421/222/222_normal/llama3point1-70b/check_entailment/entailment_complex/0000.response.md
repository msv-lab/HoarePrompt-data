Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the problem description, which requires the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the provided program only extracts and returns uppercase characters from the input string 's'. 

Specifically, the function iterates through each character of the input string and appends only the uppercase characters to the result. This is not aligned with the requirement to remove lowercase substrings. Thus, the function fails to meet the stated requirements of the problem description. 

In summary, the function should have removed lowercase letters from the string rather than returning only the uppercase letters, making it incorrect according to the problem description.
