Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not fulfill the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the function `func_1` only collects uppercase characters while completely ignoring the existence of lowercase characters and other types of characters. The output hints also clarify that the function's purpose is to return only uppercase characters, which further confirms that the function fails to address the requirement to remove lowercase substrings as specified in the problem description. Thus, the assessment is accurate, and the program is determined to be incorrect in meeting the stated requirements.
