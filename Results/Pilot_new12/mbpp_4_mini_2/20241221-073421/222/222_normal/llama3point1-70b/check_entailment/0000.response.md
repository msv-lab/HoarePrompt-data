Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires the function to "remove lowercase substrings from a given string." However, the provided program only retains uppercase characters and does not actually remove any lowercase substrings. It simply constructs a new string with only uppercase characters, completely ignoring how to handle lowercase substrings specifically.

For example, if the input is `"HelloWorld"`, the expected behavior would be to return `"HW"` (removing the lowercase substrings "ello" and "orld"). However, the output of the provided function will also be `"HW"`, which is correct in this specific case but does not align with the requirement of removing lowercase substrings.

A counterexample is: if the input string is `"hello"`, the expected result should be an empty string since all characters are lowercase. However, the function will output an empty string as well. Hence it does not treat substrings properly but only evaluates character by character. 

The expectation is that lowercase substrings would be handled as a group, and since the program does not meet that requirement, it is incorrect. The program fails to account for empty results and does not fulfill the "remove or replace" logic for substrings. 

Therefore, the program does not adhere to the problem's requirements for all possible inputs.
