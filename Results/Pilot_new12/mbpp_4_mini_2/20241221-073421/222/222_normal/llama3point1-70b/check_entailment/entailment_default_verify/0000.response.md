Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description. The goal was to write a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the program only retains uppercase characters and does not specifically address the removal of lowercase substrings as a group. 

While it may correctly return uppercase characters when they exist, it ignores the requirement to handle lowercase substrings properly. As pointed out in the original assessment, the character-by-character approach does not align with the expectation of removing entire substrings, which includes handling edge cases correctly. Thus, the program does not meet the problem's requirements comprehensively, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
