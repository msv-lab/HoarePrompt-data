`result` is assigned the value of `result` plus `char`. Since `result` is an empty string and `char` is the first character of `s` (which is an uppercase character), then `result` becomes that uppercase character. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string that has at least 1 character, `result` is equal to `char`, `char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is an uppercase character.

Output State: **`s` is a string that has at least 1 character, `result` is equal to `char`, `char` is the first character of `s` and `char` is an uppercase character.**
