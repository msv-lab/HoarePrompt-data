Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing all uppercase characters from `s` in the order they appeared. The function does not modify the original string `s`. If `s` contains no uppercase characters, the function will return an empty string. Additionally, the function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases such as non-string inputs or other types of characters.**
