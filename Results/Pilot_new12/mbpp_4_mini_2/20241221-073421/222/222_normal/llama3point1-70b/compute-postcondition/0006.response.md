The variable `result` is assigned the value of `result` concatenated with `char`. Since `result` starts as an empty string and `char` is the second character of `s`, the new value of `result` will be equal to `char`. The states of the other variables (`s` and `char`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string that has at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character of `s`, and `result` is equal to `char`.

Output State: **`s` is a string that has at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character of `s`, `result` is equal to `char`**.
