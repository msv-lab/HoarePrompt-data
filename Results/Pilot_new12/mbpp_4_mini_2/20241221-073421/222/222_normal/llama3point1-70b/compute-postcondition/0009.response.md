Given the initial state where `s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, and `result` is an empty string (if `char` is lowercase), the code snippet updates `result` by adding `char` to it.

Since `char` is defined as the third character of `s`, if `char` is indeed a lowercase character, then `result` will be updated to include `char`. Consequently, the new value of `result` will be equal to `char`.

However, the outcome may depend on whether `char` is lowercase. Since the task specifies that `result` remains empty if `char` is lowercase, it's implied that no update occurs in that specific case. Therefore, if `char` is indeed lowercase (as per the initial state assumptions), `result` remains an empty string.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, `result` is an empty string**.
