#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that may contain lowercase substrings.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
    #The program returns a string formed by joining all uppercase characters from the string 's' that may contain lowercase substrings
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string that contains only the uppercase characters from `s`. If there are no uppercase characters in the input string, the function will return an empty string. Edge cases include scenarios where `s` is an empty string or contains no uppercase letters; in such cases, the function handles them correctly by returning an empty string. The function does not perform any operations on lowercase characters or non-alphabetic characters.
