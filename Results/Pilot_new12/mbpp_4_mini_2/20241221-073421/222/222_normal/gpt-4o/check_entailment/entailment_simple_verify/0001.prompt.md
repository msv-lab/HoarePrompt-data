You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'

def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program successfully removes all lowercase substrings from a given string, retaining only the uppercase characters as required by the problem description. 

Here's an explanation of why the code is correct for all potential cases:

- The function `func_1` iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
- It checks if each character is uppercase using the `char.isupper()` method.
- It constructs a new string containing only uppercase characters using `''.join()`.
- The assertions provided in the program are valid test cases and demonstrate that the function behaves as described.

For example:
- For the input `'PYTHon'`, the output is `'PYTH'`, which matches the expected result as all lowercase characters have been removed.
- For the input `'FInD'`, provides `'FID'` as output, again demonstrating the desired behavior.
- Finally, for the input `'STRinG'`, it correctly outputs `'STRG'`.

Since the implementation meets the problem requirements and passes the provided test cases, it will work for any string input composed of uppercase and lowercase letters, provided that it accurately filters out the lowercase substrings. Since no counterexample could be found, the result is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string that may contain lowercase substrings.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
    #The program returns a string formed by joining all uppercase characters from the string 's' that may contain lowercase substrings


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
