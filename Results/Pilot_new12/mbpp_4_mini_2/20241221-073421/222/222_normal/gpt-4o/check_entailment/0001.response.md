Correctness: **True**

The provided program successfully removes all lowercase substrings from a given string, retaining only the uppercase characters as required by the problem description. 

Here's an explanation of why the code is correct for all potential cases:

- The function `func_1` iterates through each character in the input string `s`.
- It checks if each character is uppercase using the `char.isupper()` method.
- It constructs a new string containing only uppercase characters using `''.join()`.
- The assertions provided in the program are valid test cases and demonstrate that the function behaves as described.

For example:
- For the input `'PYTHon'`, the output is `'PYTH'`, which matches the expected result as all lowercase characters have been removed.
- For the input `'FInD'`, provides `'FID'` as output, again demonstrating the desired behavior.
- Finally, for the input `'STRinG'`, it correctly outputs `'STRG'`.

Since the implementation meets the problem requirements and passes the provided test cases, it will work for any string input composed of uppercase and lowercase letters, provided that it accurately filters out the lowercase substrings. Since no counterexample could be found, the result is deemed correct.
