The problem description specifies that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the program provided actually only extracts uppercase characters from the string, essentially filtering out lowercase characters but not explicitly referring to substrings. 

The program iterates over each character in the input string and checks if it is uppercase, joining these uppercase characters into a new string. However, it does not address how lowercase substrings might be defined in the context of the problem description, nor does it parse and discard any specific substrings of lowercase letters. 

The provided test cases confirm that it filters out lowercase characters, but this does not explicitly fulfill the requirement to remove "lowercase substrings" as it doesn't imply any consideration of substrings that consist solely of lowercase characters.

The output hints correctly identify that the function returns a string of only uppercase characters and checks for the presence of uppercase characters but doesn't consider how the term "substrings" might imply structures longer than one character, nor does it clarify what constitutes a lowercase substring.

Thus, the function does not meet the problem description properlyâ€”it misses the concept of "substrings" entirely, leading to a misunderstanding of the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
