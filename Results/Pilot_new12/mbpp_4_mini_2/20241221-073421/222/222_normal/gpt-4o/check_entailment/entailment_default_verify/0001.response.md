Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem. It defines the function `func_1` that effectively removes all lowercase characters from the input string `s`, retaining only the uppercase characters. The assertions provided in the program serve as valid test cases that demonstrate the expected output.

The output hints confirm that the function handles cases where the input string contains no uppercase letters or is empty, returning an empty string in those scenarios. This further supports the program's correctness according to the problem description, as it aligns with the requirement to remove all lowercase substrings.

Since the implementation meets the problem requirements, passes the provided test cases, and the reasoning in the original assessment is supported by the output hints, the conclusion remains that the program is correct. Therefore, the final correctness of the program is affirmed as **True**.
