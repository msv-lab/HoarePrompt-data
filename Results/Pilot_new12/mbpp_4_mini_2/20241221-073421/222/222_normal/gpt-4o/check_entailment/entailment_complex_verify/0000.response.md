Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to remove lowercase substrings from the input string by retaining only uppercase characters. The provided annotations confirm the behavior of the function, explicitly stating that it constructs a new string from all uppercase characters and will return an empty string if none are present. 

The assertions in the program validate that the function behaves as expected for multiple test cases, producing the correct output for strings with mixed casing. The evaluation indicates that the function meets the problem description and has been assessed correctly with no identified edge cases that would lead to failure. Therefore, based on all provided information, the program's correctness is confirmed.
