Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement outlined in the problem description to remove lowercase substrings from the input string by only retaining uppercase characters. The output hints also reinforce this conclusion, stating that the function returns a new string with only uppercase characters and correctly handles edge cases such as empty strings or strings without uppercase letters by returning an empty string in these scenarios. The assertions confirm the expected outcomes for various test cases, further supporting the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the function meets the problem requirements and behaves as described.
