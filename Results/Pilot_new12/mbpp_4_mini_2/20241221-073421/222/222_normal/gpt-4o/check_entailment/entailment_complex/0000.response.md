Correctness: **False**

The program does not adhere to the problem description, which requires the function to "remove lowercase substrings from a given string." Instead, the function `func_1` is implemented to return only the uppercase characters from the input string, ignoring lowercase characters but without actually removing substrings of lowercase characters. 

For example, given the input 'PYTHon', the output is 'PYTH', which retains the uppercase characters but does not actually "remove" the lowercase substring 'on' in the context of the problem description's requirement. Moreover, the problem description implies a need to consider the entirety of the string and potentially remove multiple lowercase substrings (as the term "lowercase substrings" suggests that there may be more than one contiguous area of lowercase letters).

Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirement of "removing" lowercase substrings, as it simply filters out lowercase characters without addressing removal of specific substrings.
