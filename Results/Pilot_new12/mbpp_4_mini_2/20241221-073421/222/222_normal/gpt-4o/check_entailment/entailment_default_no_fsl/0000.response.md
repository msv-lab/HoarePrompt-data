Correctness: **False**

The program's goal, as stated in the problem description, is to "remove lowercase substrings from a given string." However, the implementation focuses solely on retaining uppercase characters, which does not align with the requirement to remove lowercase substrings specifically. 

While the program does return a string of only uppercase letters, it does not remove lowercase substrings in the way the problem description suggests. Moreover, the output hints mentioned that the function returns an empty string if no uppercase letters are present, which is indeed handled correctly. However, this does not compensate for the fact that it misses the core functionality specified in the problem.

For instance, consider the input string "abc". The expected output should be an empty string since all characters are lowercase, but the function would incorrectly process this situation as not needing any action since it simply checks for uppercase letters.

Thus, there is a fundamental mismatch between the problem requirements and the program logic, leading to the conclusion that the program is not correct.
