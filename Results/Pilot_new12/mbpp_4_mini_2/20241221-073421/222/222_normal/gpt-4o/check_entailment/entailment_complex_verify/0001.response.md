Final: **True**

The program meets the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string by retaining only uppercase characters. The annotated version of the code confirms that it effectively checks each character in the input string, filters for uppercase letters using `char.isupper()`, and constructs a new string from those characters.

The assertions included in the program are valid test cases demonstrating the expected behavior:
- For `'PYTHon'`, the output is `'PYTH'`, which correctly removes the lowercase 'o' and 'n'.
- For `'FInD'`, it returns `'FID'`, removing the lowercase 'n'.
- For `'STRinG'`, it outputs `'STRG'`, accurately filtering out 'i' and 'n'.

The annotated explanation elaborates that if there are no uppercase characters, the function will return an empty string, which is also aligned with handling edge cases appropriately. Therefore, upon reviewing both the annotations and the original assessment, the initial correctness evaluation is indeed justified. Thus, the program is correctly implemented based on the provided problem description.
