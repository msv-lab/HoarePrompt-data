Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string by only retaining uppercase characters. The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. The logic in the function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the string and checks if it is uppercase using the `isupper()` method. Since there are no identified edge cases or potential failures in the implementation, the function meets the requirements of the problem description.
