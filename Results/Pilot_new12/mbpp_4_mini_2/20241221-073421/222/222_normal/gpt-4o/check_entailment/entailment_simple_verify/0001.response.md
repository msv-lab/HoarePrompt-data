Final: **True** 

The original assessment that the program is correct is accurate. The annotated version thoroughly explains that the function `func_1` constructs a new string comprising only uppercase characters from the input string `s`, which aligns with the problem description of removing lowercase substrings. Each assertion validates this behavior, showing that the function correctly removes lowercase characters while retaining uppercase ones. The annotations clarify the state and behavior of the function, reinforcing that it consistently yields the expected outcomes for the provided test cases. Consequently, no discrepancies exist between the program's behavior, the annotations, and the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is indeed correct.
