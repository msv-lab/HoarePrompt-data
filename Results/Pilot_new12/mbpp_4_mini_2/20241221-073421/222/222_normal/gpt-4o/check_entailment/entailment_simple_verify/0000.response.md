Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description: it effectively removes lowercase substrings by retaining only uppercase characters from the provided string. The annotations confirm that the function's logic is sound and accurately describes the behavior of the program. By using list comprehension and the `isupper()` method, the function accomplishes its task correctly. The assertions provided confirm that the function's output is correct for the specified test cases. Since the annotations support the correctness of the program's logic and there are no identified edge cases or failures in the implementation, the assessment holds true.
