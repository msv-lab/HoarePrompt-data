Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem specifies that the function needs to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, and the function `func_1` achieves this by filtering only the uppercase characters from the input string `s`. 

Here's why the program is correct:
1. The function uses a list comprehension that iterates over each character of the string `s`.
2. It checks if each character is uppercase using the `char.isupper()` method.
3. All uppercase characters are joined together into a new string and returned.

Since the program successfully eliminates all lowercase characters (i.e., substrings) by retaining only the uppercase ones, it aligns perfectly with the problem requirements. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected with different input examples.

Therefore, the implementation correctly fulfills the task stated in the problem description.
