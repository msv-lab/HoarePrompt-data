Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers in the range from 2 to n * 2, inclusive. If n is 0, the function returns 0, as there are no even integers in that case. The function does not account for any negative integers, as those are excluded by the initial parameter definition. Therefore, the output is strictly defined for non-negative integer inputs.**
