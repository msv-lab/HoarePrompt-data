#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))
    #The program returns the sum of cubes of all even integers from 2 to n * 2, inclusive.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers in the range from 2 to n * 2, inclusive. If n is 0, the function returns 0, as there are no even integers in that case. The function does not account for any negative integers, as those are excluded by the initial parameter definition. Therefore, the output is strictly defined for non-negative integer inputs.
