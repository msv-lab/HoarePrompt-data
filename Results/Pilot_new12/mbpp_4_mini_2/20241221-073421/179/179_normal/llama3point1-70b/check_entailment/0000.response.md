To verify the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem statement and the implementation.

### Problem description:
The task is to write a function that computes the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Identifying Even Natural Numbers**: The first `n` even natural numbers are `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`. The range function is correctly set up to produce these values by starting from `2`, ending at `2 * n + 1`, and incrementing by `2`.

2. **Calculating the Cubes**: The program correctly computes the cube of each of these numbers (`i ** 3` for each `i` in the specified range).

3. **Summing the Cubes**: The use of `sum()` correctly aggregates the cubed values.

### Edge Cases:
- When `n = 0`: The program will handle this case by returning `0`, as there are no even natural numbers to sum.
- When `n = 1`: The program should return `2^3 = 8`, which is correct.
- For higher values of `n`, the program will correctly compute the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the logic of the function and considering edge cases, the implementation adheres to the specification detailed in the problem description. There are no cases I can think of where this implementation would not work correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
