Explanation: The code appears to be correct based on the problem description. The function computes the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers by iterating from 2 to n*2 (inclusive) in steps of 2 and summing the cubes of those numbers. The output hints confirm that for a non-negative integer input `n`, the function returns 0 correctly when `n` is 0, as there are no even integers in that case. Since the function meets the specifications provided in the problem and the output hints, I conclude that it works correctly for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
