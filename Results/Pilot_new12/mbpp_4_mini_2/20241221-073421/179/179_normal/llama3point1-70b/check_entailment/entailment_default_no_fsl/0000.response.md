Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

- The function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to `n * 2`. The use of the range function `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` correctly generates the even numbers: 2, 4, 6, ..., and so on, until `2n`. 
- If `n` is 0, the range generates no values, resulting in a sum of 0, which is the expected outcome since there are no even natural numbers to cube.
- The function handles all non-negative integers as per the problem description, and since it assumes valid input, negative integers are not within the scope of requirement checks.

Thus, all potential cases specified in the problem description are covered by the logic implemented in the function.
