Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement of the problem description, which is to compute the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. 

The function `func_1` defined in the program calculates the sum of cubes of all even integers from 2 to `n * 2`, inclusive. However, the description specifically asks for the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. 

To clarify:

1. The first n even natural numbers are: 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n. This means if `n` is 3, for instance, the function should calculate `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3` (which is for the first three even natural numbers).

2. In contrast, the current implementation computes the sum of cubes from 2 to `n * 2`, which includes all even numbers up to `n * 2`, thus potentially incorporating more numbers than necessary. 

For instance:
- If `n` is 3, the function would compute `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3`, but it would also compute 8^3 when `n` is 4 or higher (which is not a part of the first three even numbers).

Thus, the program fails to adhere to the requirements laid out in the problem description, making it incorrect.
