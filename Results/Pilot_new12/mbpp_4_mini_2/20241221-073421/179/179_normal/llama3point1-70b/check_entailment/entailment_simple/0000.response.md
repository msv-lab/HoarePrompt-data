Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not compute the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers as specified in the problem description. Instead, it calculates the sum of cubes of all even integers from 2 to `n * 2`, inclusive. This means that the program includes even natural numbers beyond the first `n` even natural numbers, which is not what the problem requests.

To clarify further:

- The first `n` even natural numbers are: `2, 4, 6, ..., 2n`.
- The program tries to compute the cube sum of all even numbers from `2` to `2n` (inclusive) rather than just the first `n` even numbers four times.

An accurate implementation should explain that it needs to limit the summation to the first `n` even natural numbers rather than all even numbers up to `2n`. Therefore, the program does not satisfy the requirements set by the problem description.
