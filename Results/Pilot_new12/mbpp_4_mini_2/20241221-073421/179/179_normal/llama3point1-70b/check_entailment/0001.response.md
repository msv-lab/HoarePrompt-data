To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's first break down the requirements.

**Problem description**: Write a python function to find the cube sum of first n even natural numbers.

The first n even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., 2n. The cube of these numbers would be:
- For n=1: 2^3 = 8
- For n=2: 2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72
- For n=3: 2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288

Now, the program provided is:
```python
def func_1(n):
    return sum((i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)))
```

This code utilizes a generator expression to iterate from 2 to `n * 2 + 1` with a step of 2, cubing each number. However, this range construction is incorrect.

Let's analyze the range:
- The range starts at 2 and goes up to `n * 2 + 1`.
- The endpoint `n * 2 + 1` is one more than the last even number that should be included, which is `2n`.

For instance:
- If `n = 1`, the expected sum is `2^3 = 8`, and the program calculates from 2 to 3, giving the correct result (8).
- If `n = 2`, the expected sum is `2^3 + 4^3 = 72`, and the program calculates from 2 to 5, which includes 2 and 4, giving the correct result (72).
- If `n = 3`, the expected sum is `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 288`, and the program calculates from 2 to 7, which gives 2, 4, and 6, leading to the correct result (288).

However, there's an issue with the understanding of the range:
- The upper bound of range should be `n * 2 + 1` which does cover the cases we checked but is hardcoded to iterate until `n * 2`, which can lead to wrong edge cases if it is not clarified that `2n` is the last number.

Ultimately, edge cases for n being 0 (which means summing cube of the first 0 even natural numbers, and should return 0) are not clearly handled here.

Thus, testing with:
- `func_1(0)` would yield `0`, which is incorrect as it should technically sum zero numbers.

Considering the issues above, the program does not reliably account for the edge case when `n=0`.

Correctness: **False**  
The program does not handle input `n=0` correctly, leading to possibly incorrect behavior or misunderstandings about what constitutes "the first 0 even natural numbers," which should logically return 0.
