Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the function to find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers as specified in the problem description. 

1. The function correctly generates the first `n` even natural numbers using the expression `even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
2. It then calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers using `sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))`.
3. The assertions provided correctly check for the outputs of the function for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`, which yield the expected results of 72, 288, and 800, respectively.
4. The edge case of `n = 0` is handled correctly by returning 0, as stated in the output hints, since there are no even numbers to cube in that case.

Therefore, the function works correctly for all specified and implied cases within the problem description.
