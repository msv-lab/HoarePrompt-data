Final: **True**

The program is correct according to the problem description and the output hints provided. The function `func_1` successfully calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The assertions provided confirm that the function behaves correctly for the specified cases, as the calculations for the sums of the cubes of the even numbers align with the expected outcomes.

The original assessment indicated the correctness of the program, stating that it computes the cube sum appropriately without any errors or miscalculations. Furthermore, the output hints clarify that the function indeed accepts a non-negative integer and calculates the required sum as described in the problem statement.

While the function does not handle edge cases explicitly, such as when `n = 0`, it is implicitly correct since the output would be `0`, which is the expected result (there are no even numbers to sum). The inaccuracies regarding the formula have no bearing on the correctness of the calculations performed by the code.

Thus, the assessment that the program is correct remains valid, and it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description. Therefore, the final assessment is confirmed as **True**.
