Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because while it does calculate the sum of the cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, it does not correctly implement the expectations outlined in the problem description regarding the accuracy of the return value as described in the annotations.

The annotations claim that the program returns the cube sum calculated using the formula \( 8 \cdot \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \), which is misleading. The code instead generates a list of the first `n` even natural numbers, computes the cube of each element in this list, and sums those cubes. 

The test assertions (assert statements) provided also contain errors:
- For `func_1(2)`, calculating \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\) is correct and passes the test.
- For `func_1(3)`, \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\) is also correct.
- For `func_1(4)`, \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\) is correct.

However, the discrepancy lies in the stated formula in the annotation vs. the true implementation of the code. Since the code is not matching the claimed formula for summation and relies on an actual iteration and summation, it results in an inconsistency with what is declared.

Therefore, due to this misalignment between the defined problem description, the stated outcome, and the actual workings of the code, the program does not fulfill the correctness criteria.
