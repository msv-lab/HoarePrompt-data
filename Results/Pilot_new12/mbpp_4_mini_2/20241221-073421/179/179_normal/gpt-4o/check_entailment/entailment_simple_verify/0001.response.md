Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The assertions made in the test cases match the expected results based on the cube sum calculation.

1. The function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the first n even natural numbers using the list comprehension `even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.
   
2. Each assertion is verified against the calculated cube sums:
   - For `n = 2`: The even numbers are `2` and `4`, and the cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\), matching the assertion.
   - For `n = 3`: The even numbers are `2, 4, and 6`, and the cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\), matching the assertion.
   - For `n = 4`: The even numbers are `2, 4, 6, and 8`, and the cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\), matching the assertion.

3. The original assessment deemed the program's correctness as **False** due to a misinterpretation that failed to adequately reflect the accurate outputs of the assertions against the cube sum calculations.

Given the accurate calculations and the provided annotations reinforcing the correctness of the implementation for valid non-negative inputs, the final assessment of the program's correctness is validated. Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is incorrect, and the program is indeed correct.

Final: **True**
