To determine the correctness of the program against the problem description, let's analyze both components in detail.

**Problem Description:**  
The function must find the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers.

**Annotated Program:**  
```python
assert func_1(2) == 72
assert func_1(3) == 288
assert func_1(4) == 800

#State of the program right before the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
```

**Analysis of the Program:**
1. **Generating Even Numbers:**  
   - The line `even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]` generates the first `n` even natural numbers. This is correct, as the first `n` even numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., which translates to `2 * 1, 2 * 2, ..., 2 * n`.
  
2. **Calculating the Cube Sum:**  
   - The line `cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)` correctly calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers.

3. **Output:**  
   - The function returns the computed `cube_sum`, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

**Verification Against the Problem Description:**  
- The function `func_1` takes a non-negative integer `n`, correctly generates the first `n` even natural numbers, calculates their cubes, and sums those cubes.  
- The assertions provided serve as test cases where the expected outputs correspond to:
  - For `n = 2`, the first two even numbers are 2 and 4: \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).
  - For `n = 3`, the first three even numbers are 2, 4, and 6: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\).
  - For `n = 4`, the first four even numbers are 2, 4, 6, and 8: \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\).
  
Since all test cases are designed correctly based on the problem statement, and the computation aligns with the expected mathematical outcomes:

Thus, the program meets the problem description requirements.

**Conclusion:**  
Correctness: **True**
