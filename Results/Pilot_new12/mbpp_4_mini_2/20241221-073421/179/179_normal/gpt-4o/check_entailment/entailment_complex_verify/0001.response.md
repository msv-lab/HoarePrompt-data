The original assessment argued that the program's correctness is **False** based on the observation that the expected outcomes of the assertions do not match the expected results from the function's logic. Upon reviewing the annotated version, it clarifies several important points about the function's design and the conditions under which it operates.

1. The function `func_1(n)` correctly computes the first `n` even natural numbers and computes the sum of their cubes. The assertions provided are indeed correct based on the corresponding calculations, which have been affirmed in the annotated version. 
2. For the assertions:
   - `func_1(2)` results in \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\), which matches the assertion.
   - `func_1(3)` results in \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\), which matches the assertion.
   - `func_1(4)` results in \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\), which also matches the assertion.

3. The annotation states that the function handles an edge case where `n = 0` correctly, returning `0`, which aligns with an appropriate handling of the input as outlined in the problem description.

However, the original assessment noted an issue with expected outputs suggested by the test cases, stating they do not match the function's behavior. But with the revised explanation given in the annotations, it becomes clear that the assertions reflect the actual behavior of the function accurately.

Based on these points and the clarifications provided in the annotated version, the original assessment of the program's correctness as **False** seems to be incorrect, since the program meets the problem description.

Hence, the final assessment is:

Final: **True**
