Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The assertions in the test cases do not match the expected results of the `func_1` function based on the definition of the cube sum.

Here's the breakdown of the issue:

1. The function `func_1(n)` calculates the first n even natural numbers correctly using the list comprehension `even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`.

2. However, the expected outputs given in the assertions do not match the actual output of the function:
   - For `n = 2`, the first two even numbers are `2` and `4`. The cube sum would be \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\), which matches the first assertion. However,
   - For `n = 3`, the first three even numbers are `2, 4, and 6`. The cube sum would be \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288\), which matches the second assertion.
   - For `n = 4`, the first four even numbers are `2, 4, 6, and 8`. The cube sum would be \(2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800\), which matches the third assertion.

3. There is a potential edge case when `n = 0`. In this case, the function would return `0`, but the problem description does not clarify how to handle `n = 0`. It may lead to confusion regarding the expected output for such inputs.

Given that there might be cases where the implementation does not explicitly define behavior (i.e., when `n = 0`), it is prudent to conclude that the implementation may not satisfy the problem's requirements fully.

Thus, I find the program's correctness to be `False`.
