Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The function `func_1` generates a list of the first n even natural numbers (i.e., `2, 4, 6, ...` up to `2 * n`), computes the cube of each number in that list, and then sums those cubes. 

Let's analyze the provided assertions:

1. For `n = 2`: The even numbers are `2, 4`. Their cubes are `2^3 = 8` and `4^3 = 64`, thus the sum is `8 + 64 = 72`.
2. For `n = 3`: The even numbers are `2, 4, 6`. Their cubes are `2^3 = 8`, `4^3 = 64`, and `6^3 = 216`, thus the sum is `8 + 64 + 216 = 288`.
3. For `n = 4`: The even numbers are `2, 4, 6, 8`. Their cubes are `2^3 = 8`, `4^3 = 64`, `6^3 = 216`, and `8^3 = 512`, thus the sum is `8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`.

All of the assertions are satisfied, and the function handles the computation correctly based on the problem description and provided examples. Since no edge case or potential input violation is identified, the function is affirmed as correct.
