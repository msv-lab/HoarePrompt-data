Explanation: The code meets the requirements set out in the problem description. The function correctly generates the first `n` even natural numbers using the formula `2 * i`. It then computes the sum of their cubes correctly. The provided test cases (`func_1(2)`, `func_1(3)`, and `func_1(4)`) return the expected results of 72, 288, and 800, respectively. Moreover, the function handles the input case of `n = 0` gracefully by returning `0`, as there are no even numbers to consider. The output hints confirm the functionality matches the problem description, and no edge cases lead to incorrect functionality. Therefore, the code works correctly for all specified cases.

Correctness: **True**.
