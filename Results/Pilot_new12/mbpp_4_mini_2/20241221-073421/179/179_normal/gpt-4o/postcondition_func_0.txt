The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and generates a list of the first `n` even numbers. It then calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers and returns this sum. The final output is the computed sum of cubes for even numbers derived from the input integer `n`. The function does not handle edge cases explicitly; for `n = 0`, it returns 0 as there are no even numbers to process. The annotations that state the return value is calculated using the formula \( 8 \cdot \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \) are inaccurate; the actual calculation performed in the code derives the sum differently through summing cubes.
