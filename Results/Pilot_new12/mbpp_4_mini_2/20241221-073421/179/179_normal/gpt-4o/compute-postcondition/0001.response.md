To analyze the provided code, let's break down the impact of executing the line:

1. `cube_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the cubes of the elements of `even_numbers`. 
2. `even_numbers` contains even numbers from 2 up to `2*n`. If `n` is a non-negative integer, then `even_numbers` can be structured as `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n]`.
3. Therefore, the sum to be calculated is the sum of the cubes of these even numbers.

Given that the values of `n` and `even_numbers` depend on `n`, we find the specific outputs.

- The `even_numbers` list will be: `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n]`, which can be expressed mathematically as `[2*i for i in range(1, n+1)]`.
- `cube_sum` will hence be calculated using the formula: 
  \[
  \text{cube\_sum} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (2i)^3 = 8 \sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3
  \]
  This is equal to \( 8 \cdot \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \).

After executing this code, `cube_sum` will now hold this calculated value. The values of `n` and the list `even_numbers` are retained in the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `even_numbers` is a list containing the even numbers from 2 up to 2*n; `cube_sum` is equal to \( 8 \cdot \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \).**
