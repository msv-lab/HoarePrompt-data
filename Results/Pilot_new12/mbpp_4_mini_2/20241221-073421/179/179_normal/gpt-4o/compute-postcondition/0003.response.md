The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it computes a value called `cube_sum`, which is derived from the formula \( 8 \cdot \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return the computed value `cube_sum` based on the specified formula. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n and returns the value of cube_sum calculated as \( 8 \cdot \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \).**
