The `even_numbers` list is generated by multiplying each integer `i` in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) by 2. Therefore, `even_numbers` will contain the first `n` even numbers, which can be expressed as `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n]`. The variable `n` remains unchanged since the code only assigns a new list to `even_numbers`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `even_numbers` is a list containing the even numbers from 2 up to 2*n**.
