#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns cube_sum which is calculated as \( 8 \cdot \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \) for the given non-negative integer n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and generates a list of the first `n` even numbers. It then calculates the sum of the cubes of these even numbers and returns this sum. The final output is the computed sum of cubes for even numbers derived from the input integer `n`. The function does not handle edge cases explicitly; for `n = 0`, it returns 0 as there are no even numbers to process. The annotations that state the return value is calculated using the formula \( 8 \cdot \left( \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \right)^2 \) are inaccurate; the actual calculation performed in the code derives the sum differently through summing cubes.
