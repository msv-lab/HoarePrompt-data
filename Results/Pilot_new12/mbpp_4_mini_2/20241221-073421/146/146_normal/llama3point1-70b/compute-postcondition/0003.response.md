The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of variable length. After executing the function body, it returns the length of the longest sublist, denoted as `max_len`, and the first sublist in `max_sublists`, which contains the sublists of maximum length from `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return both the length of the longest sublist and the first sublist that has that maximum length. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns the length of the longest sublist and the first sublist from list_of_lists that has this maximum length.**
