Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists of variable lengths. It computes the length of the longest sublist (`max_len`) and returns it along with the first sublist from `list_of_lists` that has this maximum length. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` when it attempts to compute `max_len` since the `max` function will fail with an empty input. Thus, the function does not handle the case of an empty input list gracefully. In conclusion, the function aims to identify the longest sublist while potentially encountering errors if the input is empty.**
