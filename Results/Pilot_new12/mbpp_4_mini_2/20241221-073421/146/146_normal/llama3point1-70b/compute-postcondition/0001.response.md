In the given code, `max_sublists` is assigned a list comprehension that extracts sublists from `list_of_lists` which are of length equal to `max_len`. Therefore, the output state will include `max_sublists` as a list containing all sublists from `list_of_lists` that have the length `max_len`. The `list_of_lists` and `max_len` remain unchanged post-execution. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of variable length; `max_len` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`; `max_sublists` is a list of sublists from `list_of_lists` that have length `max_len`.**
