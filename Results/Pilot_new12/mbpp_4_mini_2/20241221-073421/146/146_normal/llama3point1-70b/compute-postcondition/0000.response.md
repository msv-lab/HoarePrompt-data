The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of the maximum length among all the sublists in `list_of_lists`. The state of `list_of_lists` remains unchanged, but `max_len` will now hold the value of the length of the longest sublist within it. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists of variable length; `max_len` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
