#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of variable length.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns the length of the longest sublist 'max_len' and the first sublist in 'max_sublists' which contains the sublists of maximum length from 'list_of_lists'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists of variable lengths. It computes the length of the longest sublist (`max_len`) and returns it along with the first sublist from `list_of_lists` that has this maximum length. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` when it attempts to compute `max_len` since the `max` function will fail with an empty input. Thus, the function does not handle the case of an empty input list gracefully. In conclusion, the function aims to identify the longest sublist while potentially encountering errors if the input is empty.
