Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not meet the problem description, which is to find all sublists of maximum length in a list of lists. Instead, the function `func_1` only returns the first sublist that matches the maximum length and also fails to handle the edge case of an empty input list, where it would raise a `ValueError`. 

Thus, both issues noted in the original assessment support the conclusion that the function does not fulfill its intended purpose as laid out in the problem description. The output hints further reinforce this assessment by stating that while the function aims to identify the longest sublist, it would fail to do so and raise an error for an empty list. Therefore, the final correctness of the program remains incorrect as it neither satisfies the requirement of returning all maximum-length sublists nor gracefully handles empty inputs.
