You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of variable length.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns the length of the longest sublist 'max_len' and the first sublist in 'max_sublists' which contains the sublists of maximum length from 'list_of_lists'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists of variable lengths. It computes the length of the longest sublist (`max_len`) and returns it along with the first sublist from `list_of_lists` that has this maximum length. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError` when it attempts to compute `max_len` since the `max` function will fail with an empty input. Thus, the function does not handle the case of an empty input list gracefully. In conclusion, the function aims to identify the longest sublist while potentially encountering errors if the input is empty.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
