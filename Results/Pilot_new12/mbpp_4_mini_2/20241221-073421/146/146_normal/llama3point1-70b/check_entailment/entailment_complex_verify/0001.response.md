Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not meet the problem description. The function `func_1` is intended to find and return all sublists of maximum length from a given list of lists. However, it only returns the first sublist that matches the maximum length, ignoring any others that may also have that same length. 

Additionally, the function does not handle edge cases such as when `list_of_lists` is empty, resulting in a potential `ValueError` due to the use of the `max()` function on an empty iterable. This confirms that the function does not gracefully handle cases it may encounter, contrary to the expectations set by the problem description. 

Overall, the annotated version supports the assessment that the function fails to deliver the correct functionality as required by the problem description. Thus, the final conclusion remains that the program is incorrect.
