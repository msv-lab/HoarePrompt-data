Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program `func_1` does not fulfill the problem description, which requires finding the list(s) of maximum length in a list of lists. The function attempts to return a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist of that length. However, if the input `list_of_lists` contains an empty sublist that happens to be the first encountered sublist, the function incorrectly returns `([], 0)` when it should return the sublist with the maximum length.

Additionally, the function doesn't handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty, which would raise a `ValueError` due to the use of the `max` function. Thus, the correctness of the implementation is indeed **False**, as it fails to meet the requirements of the problem description in both provided behavior and handling of edge cases.
