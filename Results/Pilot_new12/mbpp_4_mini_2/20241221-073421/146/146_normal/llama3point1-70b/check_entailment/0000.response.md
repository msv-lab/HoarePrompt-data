Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not correctly fulfill the problem description, which requires finding the list(s) of maximum length in a list of lists. 

Here is a potential case where the function does not work as expected:
- If the input is `list_of_lists = [[], [1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]]`, the maximum length is 3 (for the sublist `[3, 4, 5]`). However, the function returns `(3, [])`, as it always returns the first sublist that has the maximum length, which is an empty list. This is incorrect because the output should include the actual sublist(s) of maximum length, not the first instance or an empty list if it exists.

Therefore, since the function fails for this input case, the correctness of the implementation is False.
