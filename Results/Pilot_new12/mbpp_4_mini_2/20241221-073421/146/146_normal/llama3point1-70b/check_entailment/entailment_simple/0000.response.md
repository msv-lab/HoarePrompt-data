The provided program is intended to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists, as specified in the problem description. Let's break down the program step-by-step:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input.
2. It computes the maximum length of the sublists using `max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)`.
3. It then creates a list of sublists that have this maximum length with a list comprehension: `[sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]`.
4. The function returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the longest sublist, and `max_sublists[0]`, which is the first sublist that has this maximum length.

Now, let's analyze how this relates to the problem description:

- The problem requires a function that finds "the list of maximum length" in a list of lists. However, the function is returning both the maximum length and only the first sublist of maximum length, violating the requirement of returning all sublists of maximum length.
- The returned output is not consistent with the wording of the problem description, which implies that multiple maximum-length sublists should be included in the output rather than just the first one.

Given this analysis:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not fully satisfy the problem requirements because it fails to return all sublists of maximum length, only returning the first one instead.
