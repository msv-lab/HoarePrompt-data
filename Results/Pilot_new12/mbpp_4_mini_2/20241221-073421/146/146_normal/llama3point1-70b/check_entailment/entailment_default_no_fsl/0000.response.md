Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. When the input is an empty list, the `max` function raises a `ValueError` because there are no elements to compute the maximum length from. This behavior contradicts the requirement to successfully find the longest sublist for every potential case, including when the input is empty. Therefore, the function does not meet the problem's requirements adequately.
