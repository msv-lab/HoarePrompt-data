The function `func_1` is designed to find the list of maximum length from a list of lists, as described in the problem statement. The key points to consider are:

1. The function starts by calculating `max_len` using the built-in `max` function on the lengths of the sublists.
2. It then constructs `max_sublists`, which contains all the sublists that have the length equal to `max_len`.
3. Finally, it returns a tuple with `max_len` and the first sublist from `max_sublists`.

From the output hints, we see that if `list_of_lists` is empty, the `max` function will raise a `ValueError`. This means the function does not handle the case of an empty input list gracefully. According to the provided guidance, if the function does not meet the problem description for every potential case, then it is considered incorrect.

Possible failure case:
- Calling `func_1([])` will result in a `ValueError`, since there are no sublists to measure lengths.

Given these points, the function does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description for every potential case (specifically the case where the input list is empty).

Correctness: **False**.
