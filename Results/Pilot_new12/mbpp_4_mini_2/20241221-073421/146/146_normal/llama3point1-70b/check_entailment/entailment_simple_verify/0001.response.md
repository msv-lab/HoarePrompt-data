Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided annotated version of the code. The function `func_1` is supposed to return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length, but it only returns the first sublist matching that length. This is a clear violation of the requirement specified in the problem description, which expects all maximum-length sublists to be returned rather than just one. Additionally, the annotated version highlights that the program does not handle an empty list input, which would result in an error, further contributing to its incorrectness. Therefore, the issues identified in the original assessment stand, confirming that the program does not meet the specification of returning all maximum-length sublists.
