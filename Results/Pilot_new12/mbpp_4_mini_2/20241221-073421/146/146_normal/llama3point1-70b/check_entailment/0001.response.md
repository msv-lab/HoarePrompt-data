Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the problem description, which is to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. The function `func_1` returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the first sublist with that length. However, there are a couple of issues:

1. **Incorrect Return Value**: The problem description likely expects the function to return all sublists that have the maximum length, but the program only returns the first of those sublists. For example, if `list_of_lists` contains several sublists of the same maximum length, the function will not return all of them, thus failing to fulfill the requirement of providing a list of all maximum-length sublists.

2. **Empty Input Case**: If the input `list_of_lists` is empty (`[]`), the program will raise a `ValueError` when executing `max()`, as there are no sublists to compute the maximum length from. This is an edge case that is not handled in the code.

For these reasons, the code is deemed incorrect. For example, calling `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])` would correctly return `(2, [1, 2])`, but calling `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6, 7]])` would fail in terms of returning all maximum length lists, as it would return just the first one. Additionally, calling `func_1([])` would result in an error.
