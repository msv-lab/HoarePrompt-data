Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly meet the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should return a list of all sublists that have the maximum length. However, the current implementation only returns the length of the longest sublist and the first sublist that has this maximum length, instead of returning a list of all maximum length sublists.

Here's the key point:
- The problem description specifically asks for a list of the maximum length sublists, but the implementation returns only the first of these sublists along with its length.

Therefore, even under the assumption that the inputs are valid, the program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description as it fails to return all sublists of maximum length.
