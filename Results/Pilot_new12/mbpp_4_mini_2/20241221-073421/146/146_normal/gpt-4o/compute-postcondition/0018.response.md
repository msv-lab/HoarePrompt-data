Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists. It iterates through each sublist to determine the length of the longest sublist, storing both the length and the sublist itself. After execution, it returns a tuple containing two values: `max_len`, the length of the longest sublist, and `max_list`, the longest sublist itself. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns `max_len` as 0 and `max_list` as an empty list. Importantly, the original list `list_of_lists` remains unchanged throughout this process. The implementation does not handle cases where sublists may not exist or contain `None` values; it assumes all elements in `list_of_lists` are valid sublists.**
