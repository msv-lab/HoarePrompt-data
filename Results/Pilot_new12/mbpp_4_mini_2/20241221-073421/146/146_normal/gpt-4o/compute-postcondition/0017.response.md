The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying lengths. After executing the function body, if `list_of_lists` is empty, it returns `max_len` as 0 and `max_list` as an empty list. If `list_of_lists` contains sublists, it returns the length of the longest sublist as `max_len` and the longest sublist itself as `max_list`, while keeping `list_of_lists` unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sublists and return the length and the contents of the longest sublist or handle empty input appropriately.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, and returns the length of the longest sublist as max_len and the longest sublist itself as max_list. If list_of_lists is empty, it returns max_len as 0 and max_list as an empty list.**
