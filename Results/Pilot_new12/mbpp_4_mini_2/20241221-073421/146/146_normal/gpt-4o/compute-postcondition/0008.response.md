`max_len` is assigned the value of the length of `lst`. Since `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, its length will determine the new value of `max_len`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 2 sublists, `lst` is the second sublist in the list_of_lists.

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 2 sublists, `lst` is the second sublist in the list_of_lists.**
