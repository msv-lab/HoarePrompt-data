The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of `len(lst)`, which is the length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since the length of `lst` is greater than 0 and is greater than the initial `max_len`, `max_len` will now hold a positive integer value representing the length of `lst`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist, and `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists` with a length greater than 0.**
