According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` contains at least 2 sublists, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, and `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist. For the loop to execute one more time, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 2 sublists and `lst` must be set to the second sublist in the `list_of_lists`.

State: **`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 2 sublists, `lst` is the second sublist in the list_of_lists**
