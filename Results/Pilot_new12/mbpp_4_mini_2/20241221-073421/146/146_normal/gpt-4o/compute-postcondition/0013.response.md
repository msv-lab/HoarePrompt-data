`max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. The value of `max_len` remains unchanged as it is still equal to the length of `lst`, and `lst` still refers to the third sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` now holds the same value as `lst`, and `lst` is still the third sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`, `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
