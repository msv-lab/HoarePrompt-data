According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, the loop can execute. Given that `max_len` is initialized to 0 and `max_list` is an empty list, these values do not affect the execution of the for loop directly.

Thus, for the loop to execute, it is necessary that `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist. At the start of the first iteration, `lst` should reference the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.

State: **`max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 1 sublist, `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**
