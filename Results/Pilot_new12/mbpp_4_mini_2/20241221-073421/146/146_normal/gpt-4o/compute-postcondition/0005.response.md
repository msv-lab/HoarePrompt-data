The statement assigns `max_list` the value of `lst`, which is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. The previous state indicates that `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, and `max_list` was previously an empty list. With this assignment, `max_list` is no longer empty but now holds the same elements as `lst`. The values of `max_len`, `list_of_lists`, and `lst` do not change.

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`, `list_of_lists` contains at least 1 sublist, and `lst` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists` with a length greater than 0.**
