The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`, which is the second sublist in the `list_of_lists`. The previous state indicates `max_len` is the length of `lst` and `max_list` was initially an empty list. Now, `max_list` holds the contents of `lst`, and `max_len` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`, `list_of_lists` must contain at least 2 sublists, `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
