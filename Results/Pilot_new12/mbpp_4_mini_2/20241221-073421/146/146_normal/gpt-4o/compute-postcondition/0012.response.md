The variable `max_len` is assigned the value of `len(lst)`, which calculates the length of the sublist `lst`. Since `max_len` was initially 0, it will be updated to the actual length of `lst`. The variable `max_list` remains unchanged, and `lst` still represents the third sublist in `list_of_lists`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists**.
