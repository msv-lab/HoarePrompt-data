#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can be of varying lengths.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = 0
    max_list = []
    for lst in list_of_lists:
        if len(lst) > max_len:
            max_len = len(lst)
            max_list = lst
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `max_len` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the longest sublist from `list_of_lists`, and `list_of_lists` remains unchanged. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_len` is 0 and `max_list` is an empty list.
    return max_len, max_list
    #The program returns the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists` as `max_len` and the longest sublist itself as `max_list`, where `list_of_lists` remains unchanged. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_len` is 0 and `max_list` is an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list containing sublists. It iterates through each sublist to determine the length of the longest sublist, storing both the length and the sublist itself. After execution, it returns a tuple containing two values: `max_len`, the length of the longest sublist, and `max_list`, the longest sublist itself. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns `max_len` as 0 and `max_list` as an empty list. Importantly, the original list `list_of_lists` remains unchanged throughout this process. The implementation does not handle cases where sublists may not exist or contain `None` values; it assumes all elements in `list_of_lists` are valid sublists.
