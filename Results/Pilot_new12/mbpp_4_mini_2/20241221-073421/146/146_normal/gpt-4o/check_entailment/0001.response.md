To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description of finding the list of maximum length in a list of lists, we can analyze the function `func_1` and its behavior.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function Definition**: The program defines a function `func_1(list_of_lists)` which attempts to find the longest list within a list of lists.
2. **Logic**: Inside the function, two variables are initialized: `max_len` to track the maximum length found, and `max_list` to store the corresponding list with that length. The function iterates through each list in `list_of_lists`, checking if its length is greater than the current `max_len`. If so, it updates both `max_len` and `max_list`.
3. **Return Value**: Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the maximum length and the list that has that length.

### Potential Cases:
- **Normal Cases**: The assertions provided seem to cover cases where the lists have varying lengths, and the function appears to return the correct maximum length and corresponding list.
- **Empty Lists**: One potential edge case is if the input is an empty list (`[]`). The program should ideally return `(0, [])`, but it lacks handling for this case.
- **Multiple Lists of Maximum Length**: Another edge case could involve multiple lists having the maximum length. For example, if the input were `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`, the expected output would be `(2, [1, 2])`, but the function would only retain the last list of maximum length, which in this case would be `[5, 6]`.

### Conclusion:
Based on the edge cases identified:
- The function does not handle an empty list input.
- It also does not correctly indicate which maximum-length list to return when there are ties.

Thus, the function fails to cover all potential cases as outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
