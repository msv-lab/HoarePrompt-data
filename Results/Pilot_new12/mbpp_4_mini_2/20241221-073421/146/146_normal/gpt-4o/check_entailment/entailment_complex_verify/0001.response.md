Final: **False**

Reasoning: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not handle edge cases effectively, particularly the scenario of empty input lists and situations where there are multiple sublists of maximum length. The annotated version of the code supports this assessment as it confirms that while the function returns the correct maximum length and corresponding list under normal circumstances, it fails when inputs are empty or when ties occur. Therefore, based on the problem description and the behavior reflected in the annotations, the program does not fully meet the requirements, leading to the conclusion that it is indeed incorrect.
