Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies that the program does not conform to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` only returns one of the lists with the maximum length without having a defined behavior for scenarios where multiple lists share the maximum length. As pointed out, in the case of input like `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6, 7, 8]]`, neither the first nor the last equal-length sublist is guaranteed to be consistently returned, leading to a lack of reliability in the output.

The output hints confirm that while the function processes valid sublists and returns the maximum length correctly, the inconsistency in handling ties jeopardizes the correctness of the solution as per the problem's requirements. Thus, the conclusion that the implementation is fundamentally flawed remains justified.
