The program `func_1` is designed to find the longest sublist within a list of lists. The function iterates through each sublist, checking the length of each, and keeps track of the longest one found. If the input is an empty list, the code returns `(0, [])`, which is consistent with the output hints. 

However, the output hints indicate that while the function assumes all sublists are valid (and therefore, it does not handle cases where sublists might be empty or contain `None`), the problem description does not address potential edge cases such as:

1. **Sublists containing `None` values**: The code will still count and return these sublists with a length, which may not be the expected behavior if there is an assumption on the values.
2. **Empty input list**: While the code actually does return `(0, [])` for an empty input, which is correct, it is noteworthy to consider if any logging or error handling for completely empty input lists is expected as part of the behavior.

Therefore, while the code works correctly with valid inputs according to the examples (it does return the longest sublist and their length), it lacks explicit handling of diverse scenarios suggested above per problem description. The assumption about valid inputs may lead to unhandled cases in practice which could affect correctness.

Given the above considerations, the program does not strictly ensure correctness for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
