Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the problem description. According to the problem description, the function is required to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. However, the program incorrectly returns the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself as a tuple, which does not align with the expected output format.

From the assertions provided in the annotated program, the expected output for the function calls is written as `(3, [13, 15, 17])` for the first example, which suggests that it should return the length and the sublist. However, the problem statement does not specify whether the output should be in the form of a tuple, nor does it clarify the actual requirements for the output format. 

The problem explicitly requests a list of maximum lengths, implying that the result should be a single longest list when multiple lists share the same maximum length, or a list of such maximum length lists if they exist.

Therefore, since the program returns the maximum length as well as the corresponding list instead of just the list or lists themselves, it does not correctly implement the requirements of the given problem description.  

To summarize, the program does not follow the problem description because:
1. The expected return format for the maximum length sublist(s) is not specified clearly enough in the provided code.
2. The output should focus on returning the longest list(s) instead of providing the length along with it. 

Hence, it fails to completely conform to what was asked for in the problem statement.
