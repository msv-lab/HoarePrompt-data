Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the analysis:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to accept a list of lists and find the list with the maximum length. It returns both the length of that longest list and the longest list itself.

2. **Logic Implementation**: 
   - The function initializes `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list. 
   - It then iterates over the input list `list_of_lists`, checking the length of each sublist.
   - If a sublist is found to be longer than the current `max_len`, it updates `max_len` and sets `max_list` to that sublist.
   - After completing the iteration, it returns a tuple containing the length of the longest sublist and the sublist itself, or `(0, [])` if no sublists are present.

3. **Function Behavior**: 
   - The function produces correct results, as shown in the assertions which test various scenarios. Each assertion checks that the output matches the expected length and corresponding longest sublist.
   - The program handles the case where no sublists exist (an empty input) by returning `(0, [])`, which aligns with the descriptions provided in the comments.

4. **Assumption of Input Validity**: The problem description states that the input will be valid. Therefore, it is acceptable that the function does not handle edge cases such as sublists being `None` or if sublists contain inconsistent types, as those situations are excluded by the assumption of valid input.

In conclusion, the function correctly implements the behavior described in the problem statement for any valid input according to the guidelines provided.
