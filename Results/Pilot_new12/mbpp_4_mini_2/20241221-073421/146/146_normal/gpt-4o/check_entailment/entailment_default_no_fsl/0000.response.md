Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list of lists is empty. In such a scenario, the function `func_1` should return `(0, [])` according to the provided description, but it will actually just return `(0, [])` regardless based on the initial value assignments.

However, if `list_of_lists` is empty, the function should ideally confirm that both the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself are as expected, which it does (returning `(0, [])`). The issue arises when considering that if the input includes `None` or non-list elements (e.g., `func_1([1, None])`), it does not handle those cases appropriately, and the output hints suggest these scenarios are ignored in the current implementation.

Thus, the implementation fails to account for all potential cases as indicated by the output hints. Since it is crucial for the program to correctly handle every edge case described, the judgment is that the program is incorrect.
