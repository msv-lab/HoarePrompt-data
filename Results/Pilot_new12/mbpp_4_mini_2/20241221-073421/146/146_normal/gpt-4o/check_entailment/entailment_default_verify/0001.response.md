Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because it identifies that the function `func_1` does not adequately handle all specified cases in the problem description. While the function correctly returns the maximum length and corresponding list when the input is appropriate (i.e., non-empty and having valid sublists), it fails to manage edge cases such as when the input is an empty list. According to the output hints, the function is expected to return `(0, [])` for an empty input, which it does not. Additionally, the function does not address situations where multiple sublists have the same maximum length, and it arbitrarily returns the last one encountered, which could misrepresent the intended functionality.

Thus, the conclusion remains that the implementation is not fully correct given the stated requirements in the problem description.
