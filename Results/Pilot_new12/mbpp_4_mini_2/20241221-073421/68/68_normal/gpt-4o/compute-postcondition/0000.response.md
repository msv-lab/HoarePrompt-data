The variable `complex_number` is assigned the value of `complex(real, imag)`, which creates a complex number from the given `real` and `imag` components. The values of `real` and `imag` remain unchanged. The new variable, `complex_number`, will hold a complex value that consists of `real` as its real part and `imag` as its imaginary part. 

Output State: **`real` is a floating-point number, `imag` is a floating-point number, `complex_number` is a complex number created from `real` and `imag`.**
