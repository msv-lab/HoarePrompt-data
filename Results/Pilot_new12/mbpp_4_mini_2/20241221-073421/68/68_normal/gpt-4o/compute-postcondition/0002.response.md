The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the phase angle of the complex number created from `real` and `imag`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept floating-point numbers `real` and `imag`, and return the phase angle of the complex number formed by these components.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters real and imag, and returns the phase angle of the complex number formed by real and imag.**
