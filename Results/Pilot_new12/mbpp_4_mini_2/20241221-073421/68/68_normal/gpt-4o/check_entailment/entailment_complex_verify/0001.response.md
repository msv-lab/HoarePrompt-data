Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` successfully implements the calculation of the angle of a complex number using `cmath.phase()`, which is appropriate for this task. 

The provided assertions validate that the function returns the correct angles for various test cases, aligning perfectly with the expected output for complex numbers. The annotations confirm that the inputs (real and imaginary parts) are expected to be floating-point numbers, and the output represents the phase angle in radians.

While the annotated version notes that the function does not include explicit error handling for invalid input types, the problem description does not require handling of such cases, as we assume that valid input will always be provided. Thus, the function meets the requirements as stated in the problem description.

Given these considerations, the program functions as intended, and no reasons were identified to contradict the correctness claim made in the original assessment. Therefore, the final evaluation of the program is confirmed as true.
