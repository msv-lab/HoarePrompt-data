Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is intended to return the angle (phase) of a complex number. However, the assert statements use the function before its definition. This will cause an error since `func_1` is not defined at the time the asserts are being executed. 

Additionally, the handling of edge cases, such as the complex number being zero (i.e., both real and imaginary parts being zero), is also not accounted for. The angle of `0 + 0j` is not defined, which means the program does not handle this potential case correctly.

Thus, there are issues with the execution order and edge case handling, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
