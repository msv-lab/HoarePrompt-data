Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description, which is to get the angle (or phase) of a complex number. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(real, imag)` is designed to accept two parameters representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. This matches the expectation of handling a complex number.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: The line `complex_number = complex(real, imag)` correctly creates a complex number using the provided real and imaginary parts.

3. **Angle Calculation**: The function then returns the phase of the complex number using `cmath.phase(complex_number)`, which computes the angle in radians of the complex number. This is precisely what is required to fulfill the problem's request for the angle of a complex number.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions correctly check the functionality of the `func_1` function against known values of angles for particular complex numbers. These checks confirm that the function behaves as expected for at least a few test cases.

Overall, the program meets all of the criteria outlined in the problem description by implementing a function that accurately computes and returns the angle of a complex number based on its real and imaginary components.
