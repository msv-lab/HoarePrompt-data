Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the phase angle of a complex number formed from its real and imaginary parts. The use of `cmath.phase` correctly computes the angle, fulfilling the problem description for standard valid inputs (real and imaginary numbers). However, the output hints mention that there is no explicit error handling or checks for edge cases such as handling `None` or non-numeric input types. This means that if the function receives invalid input types (for example, passing strings or `None`), it would raise a `TypeError`, causing the function to fail. 

Thus, even though it works correctly for typical scenarios, it does not handle all potential cases as required, leading to an overall correctness of **False**.
