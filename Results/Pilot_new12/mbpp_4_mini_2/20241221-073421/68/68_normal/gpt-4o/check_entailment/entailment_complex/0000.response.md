Correctness: **True**

The program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to write a function that computes and returns the angle (phase) of a complex number, given its real and imaginary components. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `real` and `imag`. These parameters allow the user to define a complex number.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: Inside the function, a complex number is created using the built-in `complex` function with the provided real and imaginary components.

3. **Phase Calculation**: The phase (angle) of the created complex number is calculated using `cmath.phase`, which returns the angle in radians. This matches the requirement of the problem description to get the angle of a complex number.

4. **Assertions for Testing**: The program includes assertions to test the correctness of the function with various complex numbers. These assertions confirm that the function produces the expected phase angles for specific inputs.

5. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The explanation acknowledges that the assumptions include handling valid input types and that no explicit error handling is necessary, as per the problem description.

Overall, the implementation accurately follows the problem description by returning the angle of a complex number derived from its real and imaginary parts.
