Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle edge cases or invalid input types since no error handling is implemented. Although the function computes the phase angle correctly for valid complex numbers, it will raise a `TypeError` if non-numeric input types are provided (e.g., passing `None` or a string). As per the output hints and the programâ€™s assertion tests, the program is designed to function with valid inputs only, but it fails to meet the correctness criteria for all potential cases due to the lack of error handling for invalid inputs.
