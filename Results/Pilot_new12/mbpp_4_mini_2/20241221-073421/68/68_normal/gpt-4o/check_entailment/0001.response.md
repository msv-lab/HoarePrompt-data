Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to get the angle of a complex number. It uses the `cmath.phase()` method, which accurately computes the phase (or angle) of a complex number in radians. The test cases provided assert that the function returns the expected values for different complex numbers.

The computed angles for the test cases are:
1. For `func_1(0, 1j)` returns `1.5707963267948966`, which corresponds to a 90-degree angle (Ï€/2 radians), as expected for the imaginary unit.
2. For `func_1(2, 1j)` returns `0.4636476090008061`, which is the angle of the complex number `2 + 1j` (approximately 26.57 degrees), also correct.
3. For `func_1(0, 2j)` again returns `1.5707963267948966`, which is the angle for the complex number `0 + 2j`, validating the output for a purely imaginary number.

The use of `cmath` ensures that all edge cases, including the quadrant of the complex plane and special cases like zero, are handled properly by the `phase` function. Therefore, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem's requirements.
