#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are both floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_number = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_number)
    #The program returns the phase angle of the complex number created from `real` and `imag`, which are its real and imaginary parts, respectively.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two floating-point parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It uses these parameters to create a complex number, and then returns the phase angle of that complex number in radians. The phase angle indicates the direction of the vector represented by the complex number in the complex plane. No explicit error handling or checks for edge cases such as handling None or non-numeric input types are present in the function. As a result, passing invalid types may cause the function to raise a TypeError. After execution, the state of the program includes this phase angle derived from the input complex number.
