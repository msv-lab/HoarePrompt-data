You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly computes the angle (or phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The function `func_1` constructs a complex number using Python's built-in `complex(real, imag)` function and then utilizes `cmath.phase()` to get the angle in radians. 

Since the angle of a complex number is well-defined for all inputs (including edge cases like zero real and imaginary parts), there are no potential cases where the program does not behave as expected based on the problem description. 

For example:
- For `real = 1` and `imag = 0`, the angle is `0` radians.
- For `real = 0` and `imag = 1`, the angle is `π/2` radians.
- For `real = 0` and `imag = 0`, the angle is technically undefined in some mathematical contexts, but `cmath.phase(0)` returns `0`, which is consistent with the way angles are handled in programming.

In summary, the program meets all the requirements stated in the problem description without any missing logic or edge cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import cmath

#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are both floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase of the complex number represented by 'complex_num', where 'complex_num' is constructed using 'real' as the real part and 'imag' as the imaginary part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these parts and returns its phase (or argument) using the `cmath.phase` function. The final state after execution is that the program provides the angle in radians of the complex number in the range (-π, π]. The function does not explicitly handle cases where either `real` or `imag` could be non-numeric or if the inputs are `None`, which may lead to runtime errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
