Final: **False**

While the original assessment stated that the program has "Correctness: **True**," this assessment did not account for the caveat outlined in the output hints regarding potential runtime errors due to non-numeric inputs. The function `func_1` is indeed designed to compute the phase of a complex number correctly when given valid numeric inputs. However, the output hints pointed out that the function does not handle cases where `real` or `imag` might be non-numeric or `None`, which could lead to runtime errors. 

These aspects indicate that the program does not robustly meet the problem description as it stands, particularly because it lacks input validation. Therefore, it is not correct to assert that the program is entirely correct without considering these potential failure cases. Thus, the final assessment should reflect these shortcomings and the possibility of runtime errors under certain circumstances.
