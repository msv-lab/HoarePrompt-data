Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly computes the angle (or phase) of a complex number defined by its real and imaginary parts. The `cmath.phase` function is used to return the angle in radians, which aligns with the problem's requirement of getting the angle of a complex number.

The program handles all potential cases, including:
1. Complex numbers with positive real and imaginary parts (e.g., `func_1(1, 1)`).
2. Complex numbers with negative real parts (e.g., `func_1(-1, 1)`).
3. Complex numbers with negative imaginary parts (e.g., `func_1(1, -1)`).
4. Complex numbers on the axes, including purely real (e.g., `func_1(2, 0)`) and purely imaginary numbers (e.g., `func_1(0, 3)`).
5. The case where both real and imaginary parts are zero (e.g., `func_1(0, 0)`), which is defined to have an angle of 0.

Since the program handles all these edge cases as expected and consistently produces the correct angle for any complex number input, the code is correct according to the problem description.
