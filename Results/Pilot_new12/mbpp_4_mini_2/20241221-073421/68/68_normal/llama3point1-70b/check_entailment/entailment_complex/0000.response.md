Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number using these floating-point parameters and accurately returns the phase (or angle) of that complex number using the `cmath.phase` function.

Key points that demonstrate the correctness of the program with respect to the problem description are:

1. The function accurately accepts the specified inputs (real and imaginary parts of a complex number) in the form of floating-point numbers.
2. It constructs the complex number correctly using Python's `complex` constructor.
3. The program uses `cmath.phase`, which is designed specifically to retrieve the angle of a complex number in a manner consistent with the mathematical definition of the phase. This function returns the angle in radians and ensures it lies within the range (-π, π].
4. The program does not have conditions that would lead to invalid output, given the assumption that valid inputs are always provided as specified.

Since all of these aspects align with the problem description's requirements for obtaining the angle of a complex number, the implementation meets the criteria and is, therefore, correct.
