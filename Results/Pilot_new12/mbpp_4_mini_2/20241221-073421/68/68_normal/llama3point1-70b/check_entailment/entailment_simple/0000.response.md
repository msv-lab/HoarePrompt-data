Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. It defines a function that takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns the angle (or phase) of that complex number. Here’s how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`, which are both floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.

2. **Complex Number Composition**: It constructs a complex number using Python’s built-in `complex()` function, which combines the `real` and `imag` values correctly.

3. **Angle Calculation**: The function then uses the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the angle of the complex number. The `phase` function from the `cmath` module returns the phase angle (in radians) corresponding to the complex number, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Since the program adheres to all the requirements stated in the problem description and functions properly as intended within the assumptions of valid input, it is deemed correct.
