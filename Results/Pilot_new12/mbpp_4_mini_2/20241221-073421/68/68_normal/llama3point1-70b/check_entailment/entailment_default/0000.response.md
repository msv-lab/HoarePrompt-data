Explanation: Based on the problem description and the code provided, the function `func_1` correctly computes the angle (phase) of a complex number defined by its real and imaginary parts using the `cmath.phase` function. The output hints clarify that the function constructs the complex number with valid floats and returns its angle in the expected range (-π, π]. 

However, the output hints also note the lack of error handling for non-numeric inputs or `None`, which could lead to runtime errors. Although we are assuming valid input, this still presents a gap in the robustness of the code. This implies that if a non-numeric type is passed, the function would fail instead of returning a defined, correct output, which goes against the concept of handling all potential cases as specified in the problem description.

Thus, since the function does not explicitly handle all potential cases (like non-numeric inputs), it doesn't fully meet the problem description's requirement.

Correctness: **False**.
