Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly computes the angle (or phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The function `func_1` constructs a complex number using Python's built-in `complex(real, imag)` function and then utilizes `cmath.phase()` to get the angle in radians. 

Since the angle of a complex number is well-defined for all inputs (including edge cases like zero real and imaginary parts), there are no potential cases where the program does not behave as expected based on the problem description. 

For example:
- For `real = 1` and `imag = 0`, the angle is `0` radians.
- For `real = 0` and `imag = 1`, the angle is `Ï€/2` radians.
- For `real = 0` and `imag = 0`, the angle is technically undefined in some mathematical contexts, but `cmath.phase(0)` returns `0`, which is consistent with the way angles are handled in programming.

In summary, the program meets all the requirements stated in the problem description without any missing logic or edge cases.
