Correctness: **False**

The program is supposed to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. While the provided function correctly uses the `cmath.phase` function to return the phase of a complex number, it lacks handling for potential issues with the input types. Specifically, it does not manage cases where the `real` or `imag` parameters could be non-numeric (such as strings or other types) or `None`, which would lead to runtime errors. 

For example:

```python
func_1('a', 1)  # This would result in a TypeError.
func_1(None, 1)  # This would also result in a TypeError.
```

Since the program does not account for these potential cases and may fail with non-numeric input, it is considered incorrect.
