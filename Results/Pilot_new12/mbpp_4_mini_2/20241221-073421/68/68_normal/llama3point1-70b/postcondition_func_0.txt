The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these parts and returns its phase (or argument) using the `cmath.phase` function. The final state after execution is that the program provides the angle in radians of the complex number in the range (-π, π]. The function does not explicitly handle cases where either `real` or `imag` could be non-numeric or if the inputs are `None`, which may lead to runtime errors.
