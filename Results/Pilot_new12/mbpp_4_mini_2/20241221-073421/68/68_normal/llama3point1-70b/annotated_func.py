#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are both floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase of the complex number represented by 'complex_num', where 'complex_num' is constructed using 'real' as the real part and 'imag' as the imaginary part.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these parts and returns its phase (or argument) using the `cmath.phase` function. The final state after execution is that the program provides the angle in radians of the complex number in the range (-π, π]. The function does not explicitly handle cases where either `real` or `imag` could be non-numeric or if the inputs are `None`, which may lead to runtime errors.
