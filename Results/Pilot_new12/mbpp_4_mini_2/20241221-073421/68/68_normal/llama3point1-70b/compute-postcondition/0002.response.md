The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `real` and `imag`. Both `real` and `imag` are floating-point numbers representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns the phase of the complex number that is constructed using `real` as the real part and `imag` as the imaginary part. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and return the phase of that complex number. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `real` and `imag`, both as floating-point numbers, and returns the phase of the complex number represented by these parts.**
