Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number (an integer from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that contains 30 days. 

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Input Range**: The problem states that the month provided will be an integer from 1 to 12 inclusive. The program does not explicitly check for this range, but it has been assumed that the input is always valid.

2. **Months with 30 Days**: The months that contain 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The program correctly places these months in a list called `thirty_days_months`.

3. **Membership Testing**: The function uses the `in` operator to check if the input `month` exists within the `thirty_days_months` list. This is the correct logical operation needed to fulfill the problem requirements.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` if the month has 30 days, and `False` otherwise. This aligns perfectly with the problem description's intent of checking for 30-day months. 

Since the program correctly implements the specified functionality for each eligible input, it is judged to be correct.
