Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to determine whether a given month (represented as an integer between 1 and 12) contains 30 days. It correctly identifies the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) and returns `True` for those months while returning `False` for others. However, it does not handle the edge case of invalid inputs, particularly when the input month is outside the expected range (1 to 12). 

For instance, if the input is `0` or `13`, the program would return `False`, but it does not explicitly check for invalid month numbers. According to the problem description, the expectation is for the function to deal with all potential input cases effectively. Since the program fails to handle invalid month numbers, it does not meet the completeness requirement specified in the problem description.

Thus, the program is not correct in every potential case.
