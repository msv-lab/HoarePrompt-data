Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly identifies whether a given month (represented as a number from 1 to 12) has 30 days. It checks if the provided month is in the list of months with 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The function will return `True` for these months and `False` for all others (January, February, March, May, July, August, October, December), which aligns with the problem description. 

Therefore, it handles all defined cases appropriately, and there are no missing logic or edge cases that create unexpected behavior.
