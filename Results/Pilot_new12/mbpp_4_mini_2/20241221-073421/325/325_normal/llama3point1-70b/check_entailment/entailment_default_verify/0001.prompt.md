You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function only checks if the month number is one of the months that have 30 days (April, June, September, November). However, the problem description indicates that the function should check whether a given month number contains 30 days, which implies it should also handle other months accordingly.

For example: 
- If the input `month` is `1` (January), the function should return `False` because January has 31 days, but the function incorrectly does not account for this and will return `False` as intended for non-30 day months.
- If the input `month` is `2` (February), the function should also return `False` (except in leap years where February has 29 days).
- If the input `month` is `12` (December), the function should return `False` since it has 31 days.

Thus, the function will return `True` only for months with 30 days and `False` otherwise, which does not satisfy the requirement of checking whether the given month contains 30 days accurately and comprehensively. Given that it fails to correctly identify inputs for months that contain 31 days and also neglects leap year consideration for February, the correctness must be marked as **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer parameter `month` which is expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive. It checks if this month corresponds to one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November). The function returns `True` if the `month` is one of these months, otherwise it returns `False`. The function does not handle any input validation beyond this check, so it assumes `month` is always a valid integer within the specified range. There is no additional handling for input values outside the expected range, which may lead to incorrect assumptions if the function is called with invalid data.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
