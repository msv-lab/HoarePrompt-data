Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to determine whether the given month (from 1 to 12) has 30 days.

2. **Correct Months Identified**: It correctly identifies the months that contain 30 days (April, June, September, November) by using a list `thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]`.

3. **Function Behavior**: The function checks if the provided `month` is present in this list using the expression `month in thirty_days_months`. If the month is one of those with 30 days, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

4. **Input Assumption**: According to the problem statement, we assume that the input will always be a valid integer between 1 and 12, inclusive. The program does not handle invalid inputs, but this aligns with the problem's assumptions.

5. **Coverage of all cases**: The only months that need to be checked (1 to 12) are appropriately accounted for within the function, ensuring that it only returns `True` for months with 30 days.

In conclusion, since the function correctly fulfills the requirement of checking if a month has 30 days based on the predefined list and works within the expected input range, it is correct as per the problem description.
