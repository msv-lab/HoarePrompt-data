Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function only checks if the month number is one of the months that have 30 days (April, June, September, November). However, the problem description indicates that the function should check whether a given month number contains 30 days, which implies it should also handle other months accordingly.

For example: 
- If the input `month` is `1` (January), the function should return `False` because January has 31 days, but the function incorrectly does not account for this and will return `False` as intended for non-30 day months.
- If the input `month` is `2` (February), the function should also return `False` (except in leap years where February has 29 days).
- If the input `month` is `12` (December), the function should return `False` since it has 31 days.

Thus, the function will return `True` only for months with 30 days and `False` otherwise, which does not satisfy the requirement of checking whether the given month contains 30 days accurately and comprehensively. Given that it fails to correctly identify inputs for months that contain 31 days and also neglects leap year consideration for February, the correctness must be marked as **False**.
