#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12 inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    thirty_days_months = [4, 6, 9, 11]
    return month in thirty_days_months
    #The program returns True if month is one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November) or False if it's not, based on whether month is included in thirty_days_months
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `month` which is expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive. It checks if this month corresponds to one of the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November). The function returns `True` if the `month` is one of these months, otherwise it returns `False`. The function does not handle any input validation beyond this check, so it assumes `month` is always a valid integer within the specified range. There is no additional handling for input values outside the expected range, which may lead to incorrect assumptions if the function is called with invalid data.
