The code snippet defines a set called `months_with_30_days` which contains the months that have 30 days (April, June, September, and November). The variable `month` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `month` is an integer such that 1 <= `month` <= 12, and `months_with_30_days` is the set {4, 6, 9, 11}.

Output State: **`month` is an integer such that 1 <= `month` <= 12; `months_with_30_days` is the set {4, 6, 9, 11}**.
