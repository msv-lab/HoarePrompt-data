Functionality: **The function accepts an integer parameter 'month' (where 1 <= month <= 12) and checks whether this month is one of the four months that have 30 days (April, June, September, November). It returns `True` if 'month' is 4, 6, 9, or 11, and `False` otherwise. The function does not handle invalid inputs outside the range of 1 to 12; thus, its behavior is undefined for such cases.**
