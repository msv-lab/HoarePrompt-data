#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
    #The program returns a boolean indicating whether the integer 'month' is in the set of months with 30 days, which are 4, 6, 9, and 11.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter 'month' (where 1 <= month <= 12) and checks whether this month is one of the four months that have 30 days (April, June, September, November). It returns `True` if 'month' is 4, 6, 9, or 11, and `False` otherwise. The function does not handle invalid inputs outside the range of 1 to 12; thus, its behavior is undefined for such cases.
