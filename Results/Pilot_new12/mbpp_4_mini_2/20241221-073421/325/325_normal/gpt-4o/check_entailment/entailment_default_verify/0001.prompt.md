You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all months properly according to the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for the months with 31 days and incorrectly marks February (month 2) as a month with 30 days.

Here are the specific failure points:
- The function `func_1` returns `False` for month 2 (February), which is correct since February typically has 28 days (and 29 days in a leap year, but the problem does not specify handling for that). However, it returns `False` for months 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), and 11 (November), which have 30 days, as expected.
- The assertion `assert func_1(12) == False` incorrectly states that December does not have 30 days when it should return `False`.

The function does not account for the edge cases of months that are neither 30 nor 31 days, specifically month 2. As such, because it fails in its definition by not covering the behavior for all inputs as expected by the requirements given in the problem statement, it is marked as incorrect. 

In summary, it fails to properly recognize the full list of months, resulting in incorrect outputs for those not handled or acknowledged in the implementation.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer parameter 'month' (where 1 <= month <= 12) and checks whether this month is one of the four months that have 30 days (April, June, September, November). It returns `True` if 'month' is 4, 6, 9, or 11, and `False` otherwise. The function does not handle invalid inputs outside the range of 1 to 12; thus, its behavior is undefined for such cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
