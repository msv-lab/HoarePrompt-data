To analyze the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to evaluate if the function correctly identifies months with 30 days based on the input month number.

The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that has 30 days. The months with 30 days are: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` to check if the input month is in that set and returns `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.

Now, let's analyze the program against the required conditions:

1. **Input Validation:** The function does not handle the case where `month` is less than 1 or greater than 12. For example, calling `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` will not return an error or a logical output, but it will incorrectly return `False` because these values are not included in the `months_with_30_days` set.

2. **Month Validity Check:** The problem statement only requires checking if the month has 30 days, but the function's behavior for invalid month numbers (e.g., negative numbers or those exceeding 12) is not defined, leading to incorrect assessments.

Thus, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to properly handle invalid month inputs, which means it does not meet the problem description's requirements for all potential cases. For example, `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` does not provide a correct response, as they are invalid inputs but would output `False`.
