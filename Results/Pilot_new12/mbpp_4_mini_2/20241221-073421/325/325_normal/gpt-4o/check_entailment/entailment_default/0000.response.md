The program aims to check if a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. It correctly identifies the months with 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11), returning `True` for these months and `False` otherwise. 

However, the output hints indicate that the program does not handle invalid inputs outside the range of 1 to 12. While we assume all input will be valid based on the task description, the lack of explicit handling means that for any invalid inputs (e.g., 0, 13), the behavior is undefined. 

Thus, if we strictly evaluate the correctness based on the potential cases (including the important consideration that it does not handle invalid input correctly if given), we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The function fails for invalid input as there is no safeguard against numbers outside the specified range (1 to 12).
