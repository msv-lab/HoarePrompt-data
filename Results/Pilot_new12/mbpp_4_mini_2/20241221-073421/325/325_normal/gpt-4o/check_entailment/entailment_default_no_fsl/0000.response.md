Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for months outside the range of 1 to 12. 

Here are some observations:

1. The function `func_1` is intended to return `True` for months that have 30 days (April, June, September, November) and `False` otherwise.
2. The claims in the output hints indicate that the function will return `False` for February (2), but it does not verify if the input `month` is valid (i.e., it should fall within the range of 1 to 12).
3. If an invalid month, such as 0 or 13, is passed to the function, it will not produce a meaningful or expected response, which deviates from the problem description explicitly stating that input will be a month number from 1 to 12.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not handle cases where the month number is outside of the defined range. For example, calling `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` would produce unexpected results.
