Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should determine whether a given month (represented as an integer from 1 to 12) contains 30 days. 

The annotated program, however, incorrectly identifies the months with 30 days by using a set `{4, 6, 9, 11}` which only includes the months of April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). The program's logic is aimed at returning `True` for any of these months, but it fails to account for the need to clarify that February (month 2) has 28 (or 29 in leap years) days, and the other months (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) have 31 daysâ€”all of which must return `False`.

The assertions in the annotated program also indicate a misunderstanding: `func_1(2)` should have returned `False`, which is correct, but `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct as December has 31 days. Thus, the function does not correctly assess all months or clearly state that only certain months contain 30 days.

In summary, the program incorrectly implements the requirement by not explicitly defining the behavior for months that do not have 30 days, thus failing to accurately represent the problem description for all valid inputs.
