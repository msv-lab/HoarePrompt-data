Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle all months properly according to the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for the months with 31 days and incorrectly marks February (month 2) as a month with 30 days.

Here are the specific failure points:
- The function `func_1` returns `False` for month 2 (February), which is correct since February typically has 28 days (and 29 days in a leap year, but the problem does not specify handling for that). However, it returns `False` for months 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), and 11 (November), which have 30 days, as expected.
- The assertion `assert func_1(12) == False` incorrectly states that December does not have 30 days when it should return `False`.

The function does not account for the edge cases of months that are neither 30 nor 31 days, specifically month 2. As such, because it fails in its definition by not covering the behavior for all inputs as expected by the requirements given in the problem statement, it is marked as incorrect. 

In summary, it fails to properly recognize the full list of months, resulting in incorrect outputs for those not handled or acknowledged in the implementation.
