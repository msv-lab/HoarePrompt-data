You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to evaluate if the function correctly identifies months with 30 days based on the input month number.

The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the month number (from 1 to 12) corresponds to a month that has 30 days. The months with 30 days are: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` to check if the input month is in that set and returns `True` if it is and `False` otherwise.

Now, let's analyze the program against the required conditions:

1. **Input Validation:** The function does not handle the case where `month` is less than 1 or greater than 12. For example, calling `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` will not return an error or a logical output, but it will incorrectly return `False` because these values are not included in the `months_with_30_days` set.

2. **Month Validity Check:** The problem statement only requires checking if the month has 30 days, but the function's behavior for invalid month numbers (e.g., negative numbers or those exceeding 12) is not defined, leading to incorrect assessments.

Thus, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**

The program fails to properly handle invalid month inputs, which means it does not meet the problem description's requirements for all potential cases. For example, `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` does not provide a correct response, as they are invalid inputs but would output `False`.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts an integer parameter 'month' (where 1 <= month <= 12) and checks whether this month is one of the four months that have 30 days (April, June, September, November). It returns `True` if 'month' is 4, 6, 9, or 11, and `False` otherwise. The function does not handle invalid inputs outside the range of 1 to 12; thus, its behavior is undefined for such cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
