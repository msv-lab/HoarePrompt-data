The given problem description states that the function must check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 30 days or not. The months that have 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

Now let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func_1(month):
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
```

The `func_1` function utilizes a set `months_with_30_days` to store the month numbers that have 30 days. The `return month in months_with_30_days` statement checks if the provided month number is in that set.

Now, let's evaluate the assertions provided in the program:
```python
assert func_1(6) == True  # June has 30 days, so this is correct.
assert func_1(2) == False # February does not have 30 days, this is correct.
assert func_1(12) == False # December does not have 30 days, this is correct.
```

These assertions correctly test the function against months 6 (June), 2 (February), and 12 (December), with expected outcomes aligned with the problem description.

Now, given the logic of the `func_1` function:
- It correctly identifies months with 30 days based on the set.
- It ignores February, which has 28 or 29 days, and December, which has 31 days, correctly returning `False` for those months.
- The approach covers all months from 1 to 12 as stated in the assumptions about input validity.

**Conclusion**: The program correctly implements the specification given in the problem description as it checks for the presence of a month in the defined set of months with 30 days.

Correctness: **True**
