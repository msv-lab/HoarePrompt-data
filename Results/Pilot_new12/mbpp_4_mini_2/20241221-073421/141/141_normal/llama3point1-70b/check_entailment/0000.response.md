To solve the problem, we need to verify if the provided function correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

Let's analyze the given function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Breakdown of the Function:

1. **Convert integer to string**: The function converts the input integer `n` to a string `str_n`.
2. **Iterate through each digit**: It iterates through each digit in `str_n`.
3. **Check frequency condition**: For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit in `str_n` (using `str_n.count(digit)`) is greater than the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).
4. **Return boolean value**: If it finds any digit that occurs more often than its value, it returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding such a digit, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Digit equals frequency**: For example, in the integer `112233`, the digit `1` appears `2` times which is equal to `1`. The function should return `True`.
  
2. **Zero in the integer**: If we test `n = 1000`, the digit `0` appears `3` times but is `0`. The check `if str_n.count('0') > 0` should return `False`, which is correct.

3. **Single digit numbers**: For example, `n = 3`. Here, the digit `3` appears once, which is valid since `1 <= 3`. The output should be `True`, which is correct.

4. **Cases that will fail**: Letâ€™s consider `n = 222` where the digit `2` appears `3` times. The function checks if `3 > 2`, which results in `False`, which is correct as per the description.

### Critical Check:

If we take an example input `n = 4444`, the digit `4` appears `4` times. According to the logic, `4` being `4` will return `True`, which is correct.

However, if we try the number `n = 221`, here, the digit `2` appears twice, which is acceptable as it does not violate `2`. The digit `1` also appears `1` time which is valid. The function should return `True`, which it does.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing various inputs and potential edge cases, the program appears to correctly account for the requirements specified in the problem description. Thus, I am unable to find an input that causes it to fail.

Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program accurately checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer does not exceed the value of the digit itself, handling various cases as tested above.
