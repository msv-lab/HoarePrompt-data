You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails for the case where the input integer contains the digit '0'. 

For example, if we input `n = 100`, the frequency of the digit '1' is 1 (which is less than or equal to 1), but the frequency of the digit '0' is 2, while the digit '0' itself does not allow for any occurrence (as 0 can't be the frequency of anything).  Thus, the expected output should be `False`, but in reality, the program incorrectly processes it and returns `True`. 

This demonstrates that the program does not adhere to the requirements outlined in the problem description, which leads to its correctness being false.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and determines whether the occurrence of each digit in its string representation is less than or equal to the digit's integer value. Specifically, for each digit in `n`, if it appears more times than its integer value, the function returns False. If all digits satisfy this condition, the function will return True. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior. After executing, it guarantees that the returned boolean indicates the validity of digit occurrences based on the specified criteria.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
