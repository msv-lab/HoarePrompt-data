Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Input Conversion**: The function first converts the input integer `n` into its string representation (`str_n`). This is necessary to iterate through each digit of the number.

2. **Frequency Check**: The main logic of the function is implemented in the `for` loop:
   - It iterates over each digit in the string representation of `n`.
   - For each digit, it counts how many times that digit appears in `str_n` using `str_n.count(digit)`.
   - It checks if this count is greater than the integer value of that digit (`int(digit)`). If any digit's count exceeds its value, the function returns `False`.

3. **Return Statement**: If the loop completes without returning `False`, it means that the frequency of all digits is less than or equal to their respective integer values. Thus, the function returns `True`.

This implementation adheres to the problem description, as it systematically checks the frequency of each digit in the integer against the digit's own value, ensuring compliance with the requirements specified. 

There are no edge cases indicated in the description (e.g., handling of negative numbers), but given that we are assuming all inputs will be valid and non-negative integers, the function operates correctly across all valid inputs. 

In summary, the function effectively fulfills the problem's requirements, leading to the conclusion that the program is correct.
