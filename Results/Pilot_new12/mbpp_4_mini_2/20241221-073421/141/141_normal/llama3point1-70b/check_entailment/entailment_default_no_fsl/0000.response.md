Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. According to the problem, the function must check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. 

While the current implementation works for non-negative integers, it fails when considering cases with leading zeros or frequencies logically impossible under the constraints of the digits. For instance:

1. If the input integer is `120021`, the digit `2` appears `2` times which is equal to its value. However, if the input was `130`, the digit `3` appears `1` time which is less than the value, while `0` appears once which is valid.
2. The code does not handle cases where the input is negative or zero, which contradicts the assurance that the input will be valid integers. Taking negative integers or emphasizing that it should not handle negatives is essential.

Additionally, it does not validate against the input type; hence if a float or a string were to be passed, it could lead to incorrect behavior.

Therefore, overall, there are scenarios where the program does not work correctly based on the problem description and requirements.
