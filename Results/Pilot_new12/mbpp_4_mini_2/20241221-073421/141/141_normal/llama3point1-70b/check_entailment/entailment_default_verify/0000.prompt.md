You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To solve the problem, we need to verify if the provided function correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

Let's analyze the given function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Breakdown of the Function:

1. **Convert integer to string**: The function converts the input integer `n` to a string `str_n`.
2. **Iterate through each digit**: It iterates through each digit in `str_n`.
3. **Check frequency condition**: For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit in `str_n` (using `str_n.count(digit)`) is greater than the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).
4. **Return boolean value**: If it finds any digit that occurs more often than its value, it returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding such a digit, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Digit equals frequency**: For example, in the integer `112233`, the digit `1` appears `2` times which is equal to `1`. The function should return `True`.
  
2. **Zero in the integer**: If we test `n = 1000`, the digit `0` appears `3` times but is `0`. The check `if str_n.count('0') > 0` should return `False`, which is correct.

3. **Single digit numbers**: For example, `n = 3`. Here, the digit `3` appears once, which is valid since `1 <= 3`. The output should be `True`, which is correct.

4. **Cases that will fail**: Letâ€™s consider `n = 222` where the digit `2` appears `3` times. The function checks if `3 > 2`, which results in `False`, which is correct as per the description.

### Critical Check:

If we take an example input `n = 4444`, the digit `4` appears `4` times. According to the logic, `4` being `4` will return `True`, which is correct.

However, if we try the number `n = 221`, here, the digit `2` appears twice, which is acceptable as it does not violate `2`. The digit `1` also appears `1` time which is valid. The function should return `True`, which it does.

### Conclusion:
After reviewing various inputs and potential edge cases, the program appears to correctly account for the requirements specified in the problem description. Thus, I am unable to find an input that causes it to fail.

Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program accurately checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer does not exceed the value of the digit itself, handling various cases as tested above.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and determines whether the occurrence of each digit in its string representation is less than or equal to the digit's integer value. Specifically, for each digit in `n`, if it appears more times than its integer value, the function returns False. If all digits satisfy this condition, the function will return True. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior. After executing, it guarantees that the returned boolean indicates the validity of digit occurrences based on the specified criteria.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
