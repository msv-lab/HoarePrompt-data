Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. Specifically, it fails for the case where the input integer contains the digit '0'. 

For example, if we input `n = 100`, the frequency of the digit '1' is 1 (which is less than or equal to 1), but the frequency of the digit '0' is 2, while the digit '0' itself does not allow for any occurrence (as 0 can't be the frequency of anything).  Thus, the expected output should be `False`, but in reality, the program incorrectly processes it and returns `True`. 

This demonstrates that the program does not adhere to the requirements outlined in the problem description, which leads to its correctness being false.
