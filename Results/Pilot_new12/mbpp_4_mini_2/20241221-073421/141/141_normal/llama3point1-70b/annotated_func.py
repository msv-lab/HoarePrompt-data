#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer; `str_n` is the string representation of `n`; all digits in `str_n` occur less than or equal to their respective integer values.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that all digits in the string representation of the non-negative integer n occur less than or equal to their respective integer values.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and determines whether the occurrence of each digit in its string representation is less than or equal to the digit's integer value. Specifically, for each digit in `n`, if it appears more times than its integer value, the function returns False. If all digits satisfy this condition, the function will return True. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior. After executing, it guarantees that the returned boolean indicates the validity of digit occurrences based on the specified criteria.
