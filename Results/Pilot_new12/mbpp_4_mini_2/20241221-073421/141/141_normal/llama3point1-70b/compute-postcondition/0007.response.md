Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representation with at least 2 characters, and `digit` is the second character of `str_n` whose count in `str_n` is less than or equal to its integer value. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` exceeds the integer value of `digit`, the program returns False. Otherwise, there is no specific return value defined in the else part.***
