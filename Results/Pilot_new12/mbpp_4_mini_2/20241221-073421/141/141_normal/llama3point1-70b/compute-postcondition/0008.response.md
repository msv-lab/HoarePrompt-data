According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `str_n`. The loop iterates through each character in `str_n`. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` refers to the second character of `str_n`, which is already given. For the loop to execute one more time, `digit` must advance to the next character in `str_n`.

Since `str_n` is a non-empty string representation with at least 2 characters, the loop can continue until the last character is reached. Therefore, if `str_n` has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute one more time for the third character in `str_n`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representation with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character of `str_n`**
