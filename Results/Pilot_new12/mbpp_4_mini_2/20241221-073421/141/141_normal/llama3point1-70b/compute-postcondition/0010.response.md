Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, and `digit` is the third character of `str_n`. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no return value.***
