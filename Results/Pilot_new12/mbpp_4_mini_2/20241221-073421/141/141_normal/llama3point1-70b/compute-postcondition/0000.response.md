The variable `str_n` is assigned the value of `str(n)`, which converts the non-negative integer `n` to its string representation. The value of `str_n` will now be a string that represents the numeric value of `n`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `str_n` is the string representation of `n`.**
