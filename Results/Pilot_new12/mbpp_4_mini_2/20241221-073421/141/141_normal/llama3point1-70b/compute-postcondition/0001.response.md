According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `str_n`. For the loop to execute, `str_n` must be a non-empty string. Since it is the string representation of `n`, if `n` is a non-negative integer, it will convert to a string. The value of `digit` will start as the first character of `str_n`. 

Thus, to ensure the loop will execute correctly, we need to adjust the state to confirm that `str_n` is not empty (which means `n` must be at least 0 to ensure proper string conversion). 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `digit` is the first character of `str_n`**.
