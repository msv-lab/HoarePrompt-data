Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and determines whether the occurrence of each digit in its string representation is less than or equal to the digit's integer value. Specifically, for each digit in `n`, if it appears more times than its integer value, the function returns False. If all digits satisfy this condition, the function will return True. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, which could lead to unexpected behavior. After executing, it guarantees that the returned boolean indicates the validity of digit occurrences based on the specified criteria.
