The code assigns the value `1` to the `frequency` dictionary at the key `digit`. The `digit` variable represents the next character in the string `digit_str`, which is a non-empty string representation of the non-negative integer `n`. Since `frequency` remains unchanged except for the assignment regarding `digit`, it will reflect that `digit` now has a frequency of `1`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `digit` is the next character in `digit_str`, and `frequency[digit]` is 1**.
