The code creates an empty dictionary `frequency`. The initial states of the variables remain unchanged, with `n` still being a non-negative integer and `digit_str` still being a string representation of that integer. The dictionary `frequency` is now defined but empty.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`; `frequency` is an empty dictionary.**
