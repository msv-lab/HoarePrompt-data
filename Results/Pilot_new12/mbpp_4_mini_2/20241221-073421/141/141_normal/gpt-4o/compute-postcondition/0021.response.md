According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `frequency` dictionary. For the loop to execute again, it must have more items left to iterate through. At the end of the last iteration, `frequency` is a non-empty dictionary, and `count` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. When the loop progresses, it will iterate over the next key-value pair in the `frequency` dictionary. 

Since `count` corresponds to the frequency of the current `digit`, for the loop to execute one more time, `frequency` must contain at least one more item. The next iteration will involve the next `digit` and its corresponding `count`. 

Thus, to prepare for the next iteration, the state must indicate that `frequency` has at least one more item to process. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a non-empty dictionary that must have at least one more item, and `count` is the next frequency corresponding to the next `digit` in the dictionary**.
