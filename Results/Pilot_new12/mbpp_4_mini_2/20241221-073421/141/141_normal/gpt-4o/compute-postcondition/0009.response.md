The code increases the frequency of the digit by 1 in the `frequency` dictionary. The variable `digit` is assumed to be a key in the `frequency` dictionary. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n` with at least one digit remaining, `digit` is the next digit in the string, `frequency[digit]` is increased by 1.**
