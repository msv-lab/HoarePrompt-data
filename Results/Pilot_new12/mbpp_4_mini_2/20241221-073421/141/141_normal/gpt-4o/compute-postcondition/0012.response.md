According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the contents of `digit_str`, as it is the string being iterated over. The loop processes each character in `digit_str` one at a time, with `digit` being the current character processed in the iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `digit_str` has at least one digit remaining, which means there are still digits left to process.

If `digit_str` has at least one digit remaining, then the loop will execute again for the next digit. Given that `digit` is set to be the next character in `digit_str`, if it is the i-th digit being processed, then for the loop to execute again, `digit` would now be set to the (i+1)-th digit in `digit_str`.

Thus, the state must reflect that we are now set to process the next digit in the string. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, `digit` is the next character in `digit_str`, `frequency` remains unchanged**
