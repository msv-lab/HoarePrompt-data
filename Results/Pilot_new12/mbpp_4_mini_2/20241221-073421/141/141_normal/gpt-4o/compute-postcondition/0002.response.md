According to the code, the loop iterates over `digit_str`, which is a string representation of the integer `n`. For the loop to execute, `digit_str` must not be an empty string. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is 0, `digit_str` is "0", which is not empty, and the loop will execute once. However, if `n` is greater than 0, `digit_str` will have a length greater than 1 and loop will execute for each digit in that string.

Since `frequency` is an empty dictionary and does not affect whether the loop can execute, we need to ensure `digit_str` is a valid string representation of the non-negative integer `n`. 

Thus, the adjustments to the state before the loop execution should be as follows:

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, `digit_str` must not be an empty string**
