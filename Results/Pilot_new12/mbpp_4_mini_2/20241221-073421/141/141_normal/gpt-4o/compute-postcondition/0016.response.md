The loop processes each character (digit) in the string representation of the non-negative integer `n`, counting the occurrences of each digit and storing these counts in the `frequency` dictionary. The loop will execute at least once if `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`. 

If `n` is 0, then `digit_str` will be "0", and the loop will process this single digit. For any non-negative integer n, the loop will successfully count all the digits present in `digit_str`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, and `frequency` is a dictionary where each key represents a digit in `digit_str`, and its value represents the count of how many times that digit appears in `digit_str`.**
