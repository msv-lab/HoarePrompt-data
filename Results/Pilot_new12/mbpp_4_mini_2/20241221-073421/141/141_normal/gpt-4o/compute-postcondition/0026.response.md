Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary with at least one more item. If the frequency `count` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. If `count` is less than or equal to `digit`, there are no additional actions taken, and the program proceeds without returning a value.***
