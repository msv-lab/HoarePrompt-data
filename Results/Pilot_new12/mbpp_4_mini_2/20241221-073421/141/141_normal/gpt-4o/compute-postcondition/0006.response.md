The code `frequency[digit] = 1` assigns the value `1` to the `frequency` dictionary for the key `digit`. Since `digit` is defined as not present in `frequency`, it indicates that `digit` was previously not a key in the dictionary. After this assignment, `digit` will now be present in the `frequency` dictionary with a value of `1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n` and must not be an empty string, `digit` is now present in the `frequency` with a value of `1`.**
