The statement `frequency[digit] = 1` assigns the value of 1 to the key `digit` in the `frequency` dictionary. The variable `digit` represents the next digit in the string `digit_str`. Since `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n`, it can contain any digit that is derived from the non-negative integer `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n` with at least one digit remaining, `digit` is the next digit in the string, and `frequency[digit]` is set to 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n` with at least one digit remaining, `digit` is the next digit in the string, `frequency[digit]` is set to 1.**
