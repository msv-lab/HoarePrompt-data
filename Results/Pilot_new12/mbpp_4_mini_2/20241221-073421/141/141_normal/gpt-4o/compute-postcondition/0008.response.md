According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digit_str`, which is a non-empty string representation of `n`. The loop will iterate over each character (or digit) in the string. At the end of the last iteration, `digit_str` is non-empty, meaning it has at least one character left. Since `digit_str` was previously processed and presumably has its leading character handled in the last iteration, the next digit, which is yet to be processed, should be considered.

Since `digit_str` was originally non-empty and we have processed one digit, we need to find out how many digits remain in the string. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `digit_str` must have at least one more digit available.

If `digit` from the last iteration is derived from processing `digit_str`, then for the loop to continue executing, `digit_str` must have at least 1 additional character left from its original length.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a non-empty string representation of `n` with at least one digit remaining, `digit` is the next digit in the string, and the length of `digit_str` must be at least 1.**
