Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a non-empty dictionary with at least one more item, and `count` is the next frequency corresponding to the next `digit` in the dictionary. If `count` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. If `count` is less than or equal to `digit`, no action is taken.***
