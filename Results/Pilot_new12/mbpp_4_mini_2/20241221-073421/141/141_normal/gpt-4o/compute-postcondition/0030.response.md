Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and verifies whether the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` does not exceed the integer value of that digit. It constructs a frequency dictionary that counts how many times each digit appears. The function will return `False` if any digit's count exceeds its value, otherwise it returns `True`. If `n` is zero, the function will correctly handle this case since the digit '0' appears once and meets the condition of the check. The function does not handle negative integers, as stated in the precondition, and it is limited to non-negative integers only.**
