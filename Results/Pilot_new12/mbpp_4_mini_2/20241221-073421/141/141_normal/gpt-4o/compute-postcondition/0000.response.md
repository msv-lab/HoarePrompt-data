The code converts the value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer, into a string and assigns it to `digit_str`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` remains a non-negative integer, and `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`.**
