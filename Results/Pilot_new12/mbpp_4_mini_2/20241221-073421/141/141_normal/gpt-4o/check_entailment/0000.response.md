To evaluate the provided program, let's analyze the problem description:

**Problem description:** Write a python function that takes in an integer and checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

The provided program implementation is as follows:

```python
def func_1(n):
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Let's Analyze the Implementation:

1. **Digit Frequency Count:** 
   - The program converts the integer `n` to a string, iterates through each character (digit), and counts how many times each digit appears. This is correctly implemented.

2. **Comparison of Frequency with Digit Value:**
   - The program then iterates over the frequency dictionary and checks if the frequency of each digit (count) is less than or equal to the integer value of the digit itself. This logic also seems correct.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- **Case with Digits Greater than 0 (Valid Example):** 
  For example, `func_1(1234)`. The counts are `{1: 1, 2: 1, 3: 1, 4: 1}`, and all counts are less than or equal to their corresponding digit values (1 <= 1, 1 <= 2, 1 <= 3, 1 <= 4), hence it returns `True`.
  
- **Case with Higher Frequencies than Digit Values:**
  Consider `func_1(111)`. The counts would be `{1: 3}`. Here, the frequency of digit '1' is 3, which is greater than the digit itself (1). The expected return should be `False`. The current implementation correctly identifies this and returns `False`.

- **Case with the Digit '0':**
  The implementation doesn’t handle how '0' should act in cases like `func_1(1000)`. Here the counts would be `{1: 1, 0: 3}`. The count of '0' is 3, which is not less than or equal to 0. Therefore, it should also return `False`. The implementation does so correctly.

- **Negative Numbers or Non-Digits:** 
  The function doesn’t account for negative integers or non-numeric input, which should be considered a potential oversight since the problem condition only specifies integers.

### Conclusion:
Considering the edge cases and how the program processes the logic, there is a gap in input validation. The description specifies checking for digits in an integer, which implies that the input should be a non-negative integer, yet the function does not handle negative numbers or any non-integer inputs robustly.

Thus, since for the input `-123` or a non-integer input such as `123.4`, the function would raise an error or behave incorrectly.

Correctness: **False**.
