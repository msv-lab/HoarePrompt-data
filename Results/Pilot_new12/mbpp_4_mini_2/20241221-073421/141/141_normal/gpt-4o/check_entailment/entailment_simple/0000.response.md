Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` is intended to check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to its integer value. However, the algorithm incorrectly assumes that the frequency of a digit (usually represented as a character in the string) cannot exceed the digit's integer value. 

The main issue arises when the digit is '0'. According to the problem description, if any digit has a frequency greater than its integer value, the function should return `False`. With '0', if it appears more than once, the function will incorrectly return `True` instead of `False` because the digit '0' has a value of 0, thus it should never appear.

For example, the input `1000` should return `False` as it violates the condition of the digit frequency being less than or equal to the digit itself because '0' appears 3 times. However, the program would, incorrectly, return `True`.

Due to this fundamental flaw regarding the treatment of the digit '0', the function does not fulfill the requirements set out in the problem description.
