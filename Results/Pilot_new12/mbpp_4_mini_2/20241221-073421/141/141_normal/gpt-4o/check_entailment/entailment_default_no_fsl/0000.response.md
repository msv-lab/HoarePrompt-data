Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. While it handles non-negative integers as described, it fails to address the requirement that the frequency of each digit must be less than or equal to the digit itself. Specifically, it does not handle the case for the digit '0', which cannot appear in the integer (as its frequency would exceed its own value).

For example, if the input is `100`, the function would return `True` because the digit frequency would be {'1': 1, '0': 2}. However, the digit '0' appears twice, which exceeds its value of 0. Thus, the output should be `False`. 

This illustrates that the program does not satisfy the conditions of the problem description for every potential case, resulting in Correctness being marked as **False**.
