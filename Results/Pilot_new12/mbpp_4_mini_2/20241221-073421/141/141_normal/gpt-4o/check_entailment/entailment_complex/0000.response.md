Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(n)` takes a non-negative integer `n` and checks the frequency of each digit in `n`. It counts how many times each digit appears and stores this information in the `frequency` dictionary.

2. **Logic Verification**: The program iterates through the `frequency` dictionary, checking each digit's count against its value (the integer value of the digit). It correctly returns `False` if the count of any digit exceeds its integer value. Otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that the condition specified in the problem description holds for all digits.

3. **Boundary Cases**: As stated in the problem description's annotations, the function can handle the edge case where `n` is `0`, since it validates that the count of '0' (which can appear zero or one times) meets the specified condition. If `n` is `0`, the function will correctly return `True` because '0' appears zero times, which is less than or equal to its value.

4. **Assumptions**: The function is designed under the assumption that input will always be a valid non-negative integer, thereby ensuring that it doesn't need to handle cases for negative integers or invalid inputs. This aligns with the problem description by not raising unexpected errors for such cases.

5. **Testing**: The function is validated with test assertions (e.g., `assert func_1(1234) == True`, `assert func_1(51241) == False`, `assert func_1(321) == True`) that reflect different scenarios of digit frequencies, confirming that it meets the requirements.

In conclusion, the program adheres to the conditions laid out by the problem description, correctly handling all potential cases it may encounter, thus validating its correctness.
