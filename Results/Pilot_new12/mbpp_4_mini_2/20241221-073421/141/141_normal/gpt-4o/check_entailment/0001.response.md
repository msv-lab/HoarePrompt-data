Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because the implementation does not properly handle the case where the digit '0' appears in the integer. According to the problem description, the frequency of each digit must be less than or equal to the digit itself. However, if '0' appears in the integer, any non-zero frequency of '0' should immediately return False because the count can never be less than or equal to '0'. 

For example, consider the case where \( n = 100 \). The digit '1' appears once (which is valid), but the digit '0' appears twice. The frequency (2) of '0' is greater than the digit itself (0), which means the function should return False. However, the provided code will not handle this case correctly, and will return True.

This demonstrates that the program can fail for specific inputs, leading to an overall incorrectness.
