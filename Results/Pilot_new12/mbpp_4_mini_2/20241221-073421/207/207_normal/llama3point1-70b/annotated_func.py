#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative real numbers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the area of a rectangle calculated as length multiplied by width, where both length and width are non-negative real numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, both of which are expected to be non-negative real numbers. It returns the area of a rectangle, calculated as the product of `length` and `width`. The function does not handle cases where the input values might not be non-negative or where the values are not valid real numbers. If either input is negative or a non-number, the behavior of the function is undefined as it does not include input validation.
