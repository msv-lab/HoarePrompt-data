Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly computes the area of a rectangle given its length and width by multiplying the two values together. It does not impose any restrictions on the input values, but under the assumption that length and width should be non-negative numbers (since negative dimensions do not make sense in the context of measuring physical dimensions), it will return a valid area for non-negative inputs. Hence, it works correctly for all expected positive and zero length and width values. No edge cases violate the problem description.
