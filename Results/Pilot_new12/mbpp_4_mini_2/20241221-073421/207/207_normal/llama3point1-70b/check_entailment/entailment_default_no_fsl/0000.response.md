Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to calculate the area of a rectangle. However, based on the output hints, the function does not include any input validation to ensure that both `length` and `width` are non-negative real numbers. This oversight means that if either argument is negative or not a valid number (e.g., a string), the function could return an undefined result. 

For example, if the function is called with `func_1(-5, 3)`, it would still compute a result (-15) even though the area cannot be negative, which contradicts the requirement outlined in the output hints. Therefore, since the program does not correctly handle all potential input cases as specified, it is deemed incorrect.
