Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width. For all valid inputs (length and width must be non-negative numbers), the function multiplies the length by the width, which is the correct formula for the area of a rectangle. 

Let's consider various potential cases:
1. Both length and width are positive integers: `func_1(5, 3)` returns `15`, which is correct.
2. One dimension is zero: `func_1(0, 3)` returns `0`, which is correct since an area of zero is expected if one dimension is zero.
3. Both dimensions are zero: `func_1(0, 0)` returns `0`, which is also correct.
4. Length and width as floating point numbers: `func_1(4.5, 2.0)` returns `9.0`, which is accurate.

The function does not handle negative inputs; however, the problem description does not specify that inputs must be restricted to non-negative values, thus it can be assumed within normal usage that the rectangle dimensions should be non-negative.

Since I can't find any example where the program doesn't work as expected based on the description, I conclude that the code is correct.
