Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the area of a rectangle given its length and width, as specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, both of which are assumed to be non-negative real numbers. 

The calculation performed by the function returns the product of `length` and `width`, which is the accurate formula for the area of a rectangle. Since the problem description requires finding the area of a rectangle and the function does precisely this, it meets the requirements as outlined.

Additionally, the program has no cases where it would produce incorrect outputs given valid inputs, fulfilling the assumption that all inputs will be appropriate (non-negative real numbers). Therefore, the implementation is deemed correct.
