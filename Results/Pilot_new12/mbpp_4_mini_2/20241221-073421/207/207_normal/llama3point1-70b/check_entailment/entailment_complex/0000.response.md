Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the two inputs `length` and `width`. 

Here's why the implementation is correct:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function accepts `length` and `width` as parameters, which aligns with the requirement to find the area of a rectangle.

2. **Area Calculation**: The return value of the function is the product of `length` and `width`, which accurately represents the mathematical formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length * Width).

3. **Non-negative Real Numbers**: The annotations indicate that the function is designed to work with non-negative real numbers. Although the explicit input validation is not implemented, the description assumes that valid inputs will be provided. Since the problem description does not necessitate input error handling, the function remains valid under this assumption.

4. **Simplicity and Directness**: The implementation directly reflects the problem's requirements without unnecessary complexity or deviation.

In summary, since the function meets the problem's specifications for calculating the area of a rectangle assuming valid inputs, it is correct.
