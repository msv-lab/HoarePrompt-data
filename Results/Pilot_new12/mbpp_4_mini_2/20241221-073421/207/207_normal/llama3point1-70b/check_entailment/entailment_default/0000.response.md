The code provided correctly calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying the `length` and `width`. However, the output hints mention that the function does not handle cases where the input values might not be non-negative, and it lacks input validation for non-number inputs.

The function seems to work correctly when given valid non-negative real numbers, as per the problem description. However, the lack of handling for invalid inputs (like negative numbers or non-numerical types) means that there could be scenarios where the function's behavior is undefined, which does not adhere to the requirement that the function should handle all potential cases according to the problem description.

For example, if the function is called with a negative width like `func_1(5, -2)`, it would logically return `-10`, which is incorrect in the context of calculating area.

Given this information, I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
