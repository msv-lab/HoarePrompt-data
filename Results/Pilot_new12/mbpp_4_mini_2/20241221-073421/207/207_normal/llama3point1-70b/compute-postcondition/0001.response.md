The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `length` and `width`. Both `length` and `width` are non-negative real numbers. After executing the function body, it returns the area of a rectangle calculated as the product of `length` and `width`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative real numbers, `length` and `width`, and return the area of the rectangle formed by those dimensions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters length and width, both of which are non-negative real numbers, and returns the area of a rectangle calculated as length multiplied by width.**
