The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are expected to be positive numbers. It calculates and returns the area by multiplying `length` and `width`. However, the function does not handle cases where `length` or `width` may not be positive, which could result in invalid or unexpected area values. Thus, the final output will be the product of `length` and `width`, but it may not be a meaningful or valid area if the inputs do not adhere to the expected constraints.
