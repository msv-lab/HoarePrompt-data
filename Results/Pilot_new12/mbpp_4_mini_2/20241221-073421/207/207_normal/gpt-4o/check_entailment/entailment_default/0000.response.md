Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to calculate the area of a rectangle by multiplying `length` and `width`. However, the description notes that the function does not handle cases where `length` or `width` may not be positive numbers. Since area is defined only for positive dimensions, if `length` or `width` is zero or negative, the result of the function would be invalid or nonsensical. For example, if we input `func_1(-5, 10)` or `func_1(0, 10)`, the function would return -50 or 0 respectively, which are incorrect results for the area of a rectangle. Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.
