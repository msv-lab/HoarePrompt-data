Correctness: **False**.

The program does not check for invalid inputs such as negative values or zero for length and width. For example, if `func_1(-1, 5)` is called, it would return -5, which is not a valid area for a rectangle. Similarly, `func_1(0, 5)` would return 0, which does not represent a rectangle. The absence of input validation means the program can produce incorrect outputs for certain inputs.
