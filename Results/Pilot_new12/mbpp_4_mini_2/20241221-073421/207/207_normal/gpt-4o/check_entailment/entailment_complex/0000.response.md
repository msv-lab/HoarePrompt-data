Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function `func_1` to compute the area of a rectangle. The function takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are assumed to be positive numbers. It returns the product of these two values, which is the mathematical definition of the area of a rectangle.

The assertions provided in the annotated program confirm that the function returns the expected results for the test cases, indicating that the function is correctly calculating the area for given positive dimensions.

While it is noted that the function does not handle cases where `length` or `width` could be non-positive values, the problem description explicitly states that it will use positive numbers, and the assumptions indicate that valid input will be provided. Therefore, under the given constraints, the function meets the requirements set by the problem description. Since the input will always be valid as per the assumptions, the function will work correctly for all anticipated inputs.

Thus, the function behaves as intended according to the problem description.
