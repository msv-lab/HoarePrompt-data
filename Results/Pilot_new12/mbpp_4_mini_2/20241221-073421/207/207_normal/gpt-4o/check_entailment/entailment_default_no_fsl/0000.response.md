Correctness: **False**

The program defines a function `func_1` that is supposed to calculate the area of a rectangle by multiplying the `length` and `width`. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where either `length` or `width` may not be positive numbers. According to the problem description, the area should only be calculated for positive dimensions. 

For example:
- If `length` is negative or zero, the area should not be calculated as it would not represent a valid rectangle. The program does not validate these inputs. Therefore, input like `func_1(-5, 10)` or `func_1(0, 10)` would return invalid results (e.g., -50 or 0) which do not correspond to any meaningful area. 

Thus, because the program does not handle cases where inputs are not positive, it does not meet the requirement of the problem description for every potential case.
