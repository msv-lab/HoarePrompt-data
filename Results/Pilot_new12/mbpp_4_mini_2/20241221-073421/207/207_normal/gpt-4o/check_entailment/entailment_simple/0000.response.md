Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements described in the problem statement, which is to calculate the area of a rectangle. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(length, width)` takes two positive integer arguments—`length` and `width`. It calculates the area of a rectangle by returning the product of these two parameters, which is consistent with the mathematical formula for the area of a rectangle (Area = Length × Width).

2. **Assertions**: The assertions given in the program check the correctness of the function with specific test cases:
    - `func_1(10, 20)` correctly returns `200` (10 * 20).
    - `func_1(10, 5)` correctly returns `50` (10 * 5).
    - `func_1(4, 2)` correctly returns `8` (4 * 2).
   These assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for the specified inputs.

3. **Input Assumptions**: The problem allows the assumption that inputs will be valid, which includes that length and width are positive numbers. Since the implementation does not include checks for invalid input (negative numbers or zero), it remains aligned with the problem's conditions as the inputs are guaranteed to be valid based on the statement.

Therefore, since the function implements the correct logic to compute the area of a rectangle and adheres to the problem's requirements under the given assumptions, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
