Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(length, width)` calculates the area of a rectangle by multiplying its length and width, which is the correct mathematical operation for finding the area. The assertions provided in the program confirm this, as they test the function with different pairs of length and width, and all assertions hold true:

- For `func_1(10, 20)`, the area is `10 * 20 = 200`.
- For `func_1(10, 5)`, the area is `10 * 5 = 50`.
- For `func_1(4, 2)`, the area is `4 * 2 = 8`.

The function works correctly for positive integer inputs, and although edge cases such as zero or negative dimensions were not explicitly tested, the core functionality satisfies the basic requirement to calculate the area based on positive lengths and widths. Since no counterexamples can be found where the program does not meet the problem description, the code is correct.
