According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on whether there are more characters in `expr` to iterate over. Since `expr` is a non-empty string, the loop will continue until all characters have been processed. 

At the end of the last iteration, `char` holds the current character being processed from `expr`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character to be processed must exist. Thus, we need to know the index of the next character and ensure that it is within the bounds of the string.

Assuming `char` was the last processed character in the previous iteration, the next character will be at the next index. The next index must not exceed the length of `expr`, and the loop can continue until all characters have been processed.

Therefore, if `char` is currently the last character in `expr`, the loop will execute one more time for the next character. If there are remaining characters left in `expr`, the state needs to accommodate the next character in the string.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and the loop index must be valid within the string length**
