Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, `char` is appended to `stack`. Otherwise, if `char` is in `matching_pairs` and `stack` is empty or the top of `stack` does not match `char`, the function returns False. If `stack` is not empty and the top of `stack` matches `char`, the function continues execution without a return, leaving `stack` unchanged or determined by prior iterations.***
