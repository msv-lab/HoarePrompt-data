The variable `matching_pairs` is assigned a dictionary that maps closing parentheses, brackets, and braces to their corresponding opening counterparts. The initial state mentions that `expr` is a string which may contain these characters, and `stack` is initially empty. After the execution of the code, the state of the variables is updated accordingly. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so we retain the descriptions for `expr` and `stack`.

Output State: **`expr` is a string that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces; `stack` is an empty list; `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**
