The code `stack.append(char)` adds the character `char` to the `stack`. The variable `expr` remains a non-empty string, and `char` is still the next character in `expr`. The impact of this code affects only the `stack`, which now includes an additional character.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `stack` now includes `char`.**
