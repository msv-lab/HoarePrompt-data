Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string and `char` is the next character in `expr`. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, then `char` is included in `stack`. If `char` is in `matching_pairs` and `stack` is empty or the top character popped from `stack` does not match `matching_pairs[char]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, if the conditions are satisfied, the function continues without a specified return value.***
