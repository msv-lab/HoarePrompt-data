Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and the loop index is valid within the string length. If `stack` is empty or the top character popped from `stack` does not match `matching_pairs[char]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no return value is specified in the else part.***
