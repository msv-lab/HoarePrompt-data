Initial State: `expr` is a string that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces; `stack` is an empty list; `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `expr` is a non-empty string. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, then `stack` contains the first character of `expr`. Otherwise, if `char` is the first character of `expr`, `stack` is a non-empty list and, if `char` is in `matching_pairs`, the last element popped from `stack` equals `matching_pairs[char]`; otherwise, `char` is not in `matching_pairs`.

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `expr` is a non-empty string. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, `char` is appended to `stack`. Otherwise, if `char` is in `matching_pairs` and `stack` is empty or the top of `stack` does not match `char`, the function returns False. If `stack` is not empty and the top of `stack` matches `char`, the function continues execution without a return, leaving `stack` unchanged or determined by prior iterations.

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `expr` is a non-empty string and `char` is the next character in `expr`. If `char` is in `matching_pairs.values()`, then `char` is included in `stack`. If `char` is in `matching_pairs` and `stack` is empty or the top character popped from `stack` does not match `matching_pairs[char]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, if the conditions are satisfied, the function continues without a specified return value.

Considering that the loop iterates over each character in `expr`, if all characters are processed, the output state reflects whether all opening characters have matching closing characters. If `stack` is empty after the loop concludes, this indicates balanced brackets.

Output State: **`stack` is empty if `expr` contains balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces; otherwise, `stack` contains unmatched opening characters.**
