According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `expr`. For the loop to execute, the `expr` string must contain at least one character. The `stack` is already initialized as an empty list, and it will be used to hold characters during the execution of the loop. At the start of the loop, `char` will be assigned the first character of `expr`.

For the loop to be executed, `expr` must not be an empty string. Additionally, `char` will be the first character in `expr` when the loop begins.

State: **`expr` is a string that must not be empty, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of `expr`**
