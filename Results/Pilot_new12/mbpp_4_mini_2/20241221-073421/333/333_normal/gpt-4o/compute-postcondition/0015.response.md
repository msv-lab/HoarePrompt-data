Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `stack` is unchanged or determined by prior iterations. If `stack` is empty or the top of the `stack` does not match `char`, the function returns False. If `stack` is not empty and the top of the `stack` matches `char`, the function continues execution without a return.***
