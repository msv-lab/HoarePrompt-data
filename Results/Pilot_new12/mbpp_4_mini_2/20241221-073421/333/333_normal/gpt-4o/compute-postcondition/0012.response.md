According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `expr`. Since `expr` is a non-empty string, the loop will execute for each character in `expr`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop has already processed the first character, and `char` is the character that was being processed. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in the string `expr`. Since the loop processes each character sequentially, and given that Python's `for` loop iterates over each character, we can infer that the index of `char` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

If `expr` is of length `n`, then for the loop to execute one more time, there must be a next character available. If `char` is the last character in `expr`, then the loop will not execute again.

To summarize, the conditions for executing the loop one more time are that `char` must be the next character in `expr` (i.e., at the index of the current character plus one). Thus, if `char` is currently the character at index `k`, then in the next iteration it must be at index `k + 1`, provided that `k + 1` is less than the length of `expr`.

State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `stack` is unchanged or determined by prior iterations**
