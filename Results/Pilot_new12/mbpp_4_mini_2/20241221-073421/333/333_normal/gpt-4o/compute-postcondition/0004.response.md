In the provided code, `stack.append(char)` adds `char` to the `stack` list. The initial values of `expr` and `char` remain relevant as `expr` is a non-empty string, and `char` is the first character of `expr`. The `stack` starts as an empty list.

After executing the code, the state of `stack` will now include the first character `char` from `expr`. Therefore, the output will encompass the updated state of `stack` and retain the information about `expr` and `char`.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `stack` is a list containing the first character of `expr`, `char` is the first character of `expr`.**
