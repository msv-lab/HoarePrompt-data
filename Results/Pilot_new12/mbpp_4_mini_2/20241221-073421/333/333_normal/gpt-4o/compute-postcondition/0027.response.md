Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `expr` that may contain parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}`. It checks whether the parentheses, brackets, and braces in the string are balanced. Specifically, it uses a stack to track opening characters, allowing it to match each opening character with its corresponding closing character. The function returns `True` if all characters are matched properly and the stack is empty at the end, indicating that the expression is balanced. If any unmatched characters remain in the stack, or if a closing character does not have a corresponding opening character, it returns `False`. The function does not account for any characters other than the defined parentheses, brackets, and braces, and thus ignores any other symbols in the input string.**
