In this code snippet, `char` is appended to `stack`. Given that `char` is the next character in the non-empty string `expr`, the state of `stack` will now include this new character.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `stack` includes `char` appended to its previous state.**
