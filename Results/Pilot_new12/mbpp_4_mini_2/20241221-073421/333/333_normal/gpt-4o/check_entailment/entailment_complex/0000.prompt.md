You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('{()}[{}]') == True
assert func_1('{()}[{]') == False
assert func_1('{()}[{}][]({})') == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: expr is a string that may contain parentheses, brackets, and braces.
def func_1(expr):
    stack = []
    matching_pairs = {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}
    for char in expr:
        if char in matching_pairs.values():
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in matching_pairs:
            if stack == [] or stack.pop() != matching_pairs[char]:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `stack` is empty if `expr` contains balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces; otherwise, `stack` contains unmatched opening characters.
    return stack == []
    #The program returns True if the stack is empty, indicating that the expression 'expr' contains balanced parentheses, brackets, and braces; otherwise, it returns False, meaning 'stack' contains unmatched opening characters.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `expr` that may contain parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}`. It checks whether the parentheses, brackets, and braces in the string are balanced. Specifically, it uses a stack to track opening characters, allowing it to match each opening character with its corresponding closing character. The function returns `True` if all characters are matched properly and the stack is empty at the end, indicating that the expression is balanced. If any unmatched characters remain in the stack, or if a closing character does not have a corresponding opening character, it returns `False`. The function does not account for any characters other than the defined parentheses, brackets, and braces, and thus ignores any other symbols in the input string.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
