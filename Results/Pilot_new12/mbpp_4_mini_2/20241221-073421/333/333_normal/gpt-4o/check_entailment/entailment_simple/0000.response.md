Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description by determining whether the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, brackets, and braces. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Stack Usage**: The function uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening symbols ('{', '(', '[') as they appear in the expression. This is a common approach to solving the problem of balanced brackets.

2. **Matching Logic**: It defines a dictionary (`matching_pairs`) that maps closing symbols (')', '}', ']') to their corresponding opening symbols. This allows the function to check for matching pairs efficiently.

3. **Iterating Through Characters**: As the function iterates over each character in the input string (`expr`), it:
   - Pushes any opening symbols onto the stack.
   - For closing symbols, it checks if there is a corresponding opening symbol in the stack. If the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the current closing symbol, the function returns `False`, indicating that the expression is unbalanced.

4. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, the function returns `True` if the stack is empty (indicating all opening symbols were matched with closing ones); otherwise, it returns `False`.

The assertions provided serve as test cases which confirm that the function works properly for various scenarios of balanced and unbalanced expressions.

Thus, the program fulfills the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential valid input cases as assumed.
