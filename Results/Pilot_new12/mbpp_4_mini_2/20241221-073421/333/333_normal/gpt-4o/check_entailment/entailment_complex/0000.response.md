Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It checks whether a given expression is balanced with respect to its parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}`. Hereâ€™s how it adheres to the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a string `expr` as its input. This string can contain various characters, including the relevant parentheses, brackets, and braces. According to the assertions, the function is able to correctly assess whether the relevant characters are balanced, while ignoring any other characters.

2. **Usage of Stack**: The program uses a stack to keep track of the opening characters. When it encounters an opening character (a parenthesis, bracket, or brace), it adds it to the stack. This is a common approach to handle such problems because it allows for proper matching of the pairs.

3. **Matching Logic**: When the function encounters a closing character, it checks if the stack is empty (indicating there is no corresponding opening character) or if the top of the stack does not match the corresponding opening character for that closing character. If either of these conditions is true, it returns `False`, correctly indicating that the expression is not balanced.

4. **Final Check**: At the end of the loop, the function returns `True` only if the stack is empty (indicating all opening characters had matching closing characters). If there are remaining unmatched opening characters in the stack, it returns `False`.

5. **Adherence to Problem Requirements**: The function returns `True` or `False` based on whether the expression is balanced, which aligns perfectly with the problem description requiring a check on balance. 

Thus, since the function accurately determines the balance of the expression as described in the problem, it is considered correct.
