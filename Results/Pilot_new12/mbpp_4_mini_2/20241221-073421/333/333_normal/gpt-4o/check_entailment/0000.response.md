To evaluate the program based on the provided problem description, we will analyze the function `func_1(expr)` that checks if the given expression contains balanced parentheses.

First, we look at what balanced parentheses mean. An expression is considered balanced if:
- Every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.
- Brackets are closed in the correct order.

Now, I will review the implementation of `func_1(expr)` step-by-step.

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes an empty list called `stack` that will be used to track opening brackets.
2. **Matching Pairs Dictionary**: The dictionary `matching_pairs` is defined to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.
3. **Iteration through Expression**: The function iterates through each character in the input string `expr`:
   - If the character is one of the opening brackets (`(`, `[`, or `{`), it is pushed onto the `stack`.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, or `}`), the function checks if the `stack` is empty (meaning there is no matching opening bracket). If the stack is empty or if the last bracket on the stack does not match the current closing bracket, it returns `False`.
4. **Final Check**: At the end of the iteration, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets have been matched correctly, and the function returns `True`, indicating the expression is balanced. If there are unmatched opening brackets remaining in the `stack`, it will return `False`.

Now, let's check for edge cases and potential failures in the logic:

### Potential Cases
1. **Empty String**: An empty string `''` should return `True` because there are no unmatched brackets.
2. **Single Bracket**: A single opening `(` or closing `)` bracket should return `False`.
3. **Nested Structures**: The function should correctly handle nested brackets like `{[()]}` which is balanced and should return `True`.
4. **Unbalanced Structures**: Cases like `{{}` or `[(])` should return `False`.

Now let's analyze if there are any issues:

- **Stack behavior**: If `func_1('{()}[{}][]({})')` returns `True`, as asserted, it shows that it handles balanced deeply nested expressions correctly.

- **Checking unmatched opening braces**: If the stack is not empty at the end of processing (which is what happens when you have an unbalanced expression), it is correctly identified as `False`.

After reviewing the function with different cases and considering various input situations, it seems the implementation effectively recognizes both balanced and unbalanced conditions correctly without any logical flaws detected.

Thus, given that all potential and edge cases have been considered satisfactorily, the code is confirmed to meet the problem description requirements in terms of correctness.

Correctness: **True**.
