Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to check if the given expression is balanced with regards to parentheses, brackets, and braces. 

Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Matching Pairs**: The function uses a dictionary called `matching_pairs` to define the corresponding opening brackets for each type of closing bracket.
  
2. **Stack Usage**: A stack is utilized to keep track of the opening brackets. When an opening bracket is encountered, it is pushed onto the stack. When a closing bracket is encountered, the function checks if the stack is empty (which indicates an unmatched closing bracket), and if not, it checks if the last opening bracket on the stack matches the current closing bracket.

3. **Final Check**: After processing all characters in the expression, the function checks if the stack is empty. If it is empty, all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets in the correct order; hence, the expression is balanced.

To further validate its correctness, the provided assertions are indeed accurate:
- The expression '{()}[{}]' is balanced and returns True.
- The expression '{()}[{]' is not balanced and returns False.
- The expression '{()}[{}][]({})' is balanced and returns True.

No potential edge cases were identified that the function fails to handle, as it properly checks both opening and closing brackets and ensures they are matched in the correct order. Thus, based on the analysis, the function meets all requirements outlined in the problem description.
