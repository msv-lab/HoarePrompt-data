Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle certain cases where the expression contains mismatched or unbalanced characters. For example, the program does not define behavior for cases where there are extra opening brackets or parentheses that do not have corresponding closing pairs, and thus it might incorrectly return `True` for such cases. Additionally, symbols other than `()`, `{}`, and `[]` are ignored, which is acceptable according to the problem description. However, the issue lies in the handling of mismatched pairs.

Specifically, the case `'{(()[{]})'` would be problematic since it contains mismatched pairs, and the code would incorrectly process it by reaching the end and returning `True` due to successfully popping pairs from the stack even if not all characters are balanced.

There are also potential edge cases where the function might not function correctly with nested brackets or varying types of brackets in specific arrangements, thus leading to incorrect conclusions about the balanced status.

Given these potential pitfalls, the program does not meet the requirement for all possible input scenarios described in the problem, resulting in a determination of incorrectness.
