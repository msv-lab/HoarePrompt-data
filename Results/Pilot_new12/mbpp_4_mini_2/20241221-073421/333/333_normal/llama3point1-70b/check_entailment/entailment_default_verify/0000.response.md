Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness as **True** makes sense based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints. The function `func_1` correctly implements a stack-based approach to check for balanced brackets. It handles various cases, including:

- An empty expression is correctly identified as balanced (returns `True`).
- Fully balanced expressions, such as `"{[()]}"`, are correctly returned as `True`.
- It accurately detects unbalanced cases, like `"{[(])}"` or unmatched closing brackets (returns `False`).

While the output hints mention that the function does not explicitly handle invalid characters, this is acceptable under the assumption that inputs will strictly adhere to the specified requirement of only containing valid brackets or being empty.

Thus, the function reliably meets the problem's requirements, and the reasoning in the original assessment aligns with the understanding of the program's functionality. Therefore, the final assessment confirms the program's correctness as **True**.
