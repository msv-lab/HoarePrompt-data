Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` successfully meets the problem description of checking whether the given expression contains balanced brackets. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function correctly utilizes a stack to manage opening brackets and guarantees that each closing bracket matches the corresponding opening bracket in type and order. Additionally, the function appropriately returns `True` for an empty input string, which is a valid case for being balanced.

The annotations clearly illustrate that after processing the expression:
- If the stack is empty, then all opening brackets have been matched with their closing counterparts, thus returning `True`.
- If there are any unmatched opening brackets left in the stack, it correctly returns `False`.

Furthermore, the code, as stated in the annotations, does not explicitly handle invalid characters but assumes that the input will consist only of the specified bracket types or will be empty, which aligns with the premise provided in the task.

Therefore, supported by both the initial assessment and the detailed annotations, the program's correctness stands confirmed.
