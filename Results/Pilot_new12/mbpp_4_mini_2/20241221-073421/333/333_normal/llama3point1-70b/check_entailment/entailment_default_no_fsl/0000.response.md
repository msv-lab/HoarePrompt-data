Correctness: **False**

The program checks for balanced brackets correctly in terms of matching pairs of parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets. However, it does not handle the case where invalid characters may be present in the input string. The problem statement does not explicitly state that the input will consist only of valid brackets or empty strings, but the output hints imply that invalid characters could be included.

For example, given the expression `"a(b[c]d)e"`, the program would treat the invalid characters 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', and 'e' as valid without any checks, leading to potential confusion in determining whether the brackets are balanced if the intention was to check for brackets only.

Furthermore, scenarios with inputs like `"()"`, `"[]"`, or `"{}"` are handled correctly as they are balanced. However, the presence of invalid characters can lead to ambiguity that isn't covered in the current implementation, meaning the output could be incorrect for unexpected input.

Since the program fails to adequately address edge cases involving invalid characters, it does not fully meet the problem description's requirements for all possible inputs.
