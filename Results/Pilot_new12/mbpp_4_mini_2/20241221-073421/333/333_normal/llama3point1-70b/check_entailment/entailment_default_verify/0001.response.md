Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` meets the problem description of checking whether the given expression has balanced brackets. It utilizes a stack to track the opening brackets and verify that there are matching closing brackets in the correct order. 

The assessment is supported by the output hints, which confirm that the function correctly identifies balanced and unbalanced bracket scenarios, including edge cases such as empty strings. The function does not explicitly handle invalid characters, but the problem description indicates that we can assume the input will consist only of valid brackets or be empty. Thus, considering all aspects, the function behaves as expected and fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
