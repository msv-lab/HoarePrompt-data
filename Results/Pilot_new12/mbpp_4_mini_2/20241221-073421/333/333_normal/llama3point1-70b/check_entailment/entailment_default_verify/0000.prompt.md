You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
    return not stack


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to the brackets: '()', '{}', and '[]'. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that every closing bracket corresponds to the correct opening bracket. 

For every potential case:
- If the expression is empty, it returns `True`, which is correct since an empty expression is trivially balanced.
- If there are balanced brackets like `"{[()]}"`, it returns `True`.
- If there are unbalanced brackets like `"{[(])}"` or unmatched closing brackets like `"([{"`, it correctly returns `False`.

The code appropriately handles all cases of matching and mismatching of various types of brackets, and the logic for using a stack to store opening brackets is implemented correctly. Thus, there are no inputs that would cause the function to fail its requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` checks whether the brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) in the provided string `expression` are balanced. It maintains a stack to track opening brackets and ensures that for every closing bracket encountered, there is a corresponding and correctly ordered opening bracket. If the brackets are balanced, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This includes cases with unmatched opening brackets, closed brackets without a matching opening bracket, or an empty input string, which is considered balanced. The function does not handle invalid characters explicitly and assumes input consists only of the specified bracket types or is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
