You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string that may contain characters such as parentheses, brackets, or braces that need to be checked for balance.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `stack` is empty if the brackets in `expression` are balanced; otherwise, it contains the unmatched opening brackets remaining. `expression` is a string that may contain parentheses, brackets, or braces, and if the loop does not execute, `stack` remains empty and `expression` has no characters.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if the brackets in 'expression' are balanced (indicating 'stack' is empty) and returns False if there are unmatched opening brackets remaining in 'stack'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` checks whether the brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) in the provided string `expression` are balanced. It maintains a stack to track opening brackets and ensures that for every closing bracket encountered, there is a corresponding and correctly ordered opening bracket. If the brackets are balanced, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This includes cases with unmatched opening brackets, closed brackets without a matching opening bracket, or an empty input string, which is considered balanced. The function does not handle invalid characters explicitly and assumes input consists only of the specified bracket types or is empty.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
