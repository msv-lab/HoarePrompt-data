Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression has balanced brackets. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures they are properly matched with the corresponding closing brackets. 

Here's how it works for various cases:

1. **Balanced cases**: 
   - For input `"{[()]}"`, it will return `True` as all brackets are balanced.
   - For input `"()[]{}"`, it will also return `True` as all brackets are properly closed.

2. **Unbalanced cases**: 
   - For input `"{[(])}"`, it will return `False` because the brackets are not correctly nested.
   - For input `"((("`, it will return `False` since there are unmatched opening brackets.

3. **Edge cases**: 
   - An empty string `""` will correctly return `True` as there are no unmatched brackets.
   - For input `")("`, it will return `False` since there is an unmatched closing bracket at the beginning.

The function effectively handles all edge cases by checking the structure of the input string and returning `False` for unmatched brackets. Thus, there are no potential inputs where the function fails to meet the problem description.
