Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to the brackets: '()', '{}', and '[]'. It uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that every closing bracket corresponds to the correct opening bracket. 

For every potential case:
- If the expression is empty, it returns `True`, which is correct since an empty expression is trivially balanced.
- If there are balanced brackets like `"{[()]}"`, it returns `True`.
- If there are unbalanced brackets like `"{[(])}"` or unmatched closing brackets like `"([{"`, it correctly returns `False`.

The code appropriately handles all cases of matching and mismatching of various types of brackets, and the logic for using a stack to store opening brackets is implemented correctly. Thus, there are no inputs that would cause the function to fail its requirements.
