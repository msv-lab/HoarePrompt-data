Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it accurately implements the requirements of the problem description to check if the given expression is balanced in terms of parentheses, brackets, and braces.

### Explanation:
1. **Data Structure**: The program uses a stack to keep track of unmatched opening brackets. This is the correct approach for checking balanced expressions, as the last opening bracket must be closed first (LIFO behavior).

2. **Bracket Matching**: 
   - It defines a dictionary `brackets` that maps each type of opening bracket to its corresponding closing bracket. This allows for direct validation of matching pairs.
   - During the iteration over each character in the `expression`, if an opening bracket is found, it is pushed onto the stack.
   - If a closing bracket is encountered, the program checks whether the stack is empty (indicating no matching opening bracket) or if the top of the stack does not match with the closing bracket. In either case, it returns `False`, indicating an imbalance.

3. **Final Check**: After going through all characters in the expression, the stack is checked to determine if it is empty. An empty stack signifies that all opening brackets had corresponding closing brackets, hence the expression is balanced.

4. **Assumptions**: The problem statement assumes valid inputs, which means that if the input is guaranteed to be a string containing only bracket characters, the program will correctly follow the defined behavior for all possible cases.

Overall, the program is thorough in both checking for balanced brackets and handling the required logic to ensure correctness according to the problem description. Thus, it effectively meets the criteria set by the problem description.
