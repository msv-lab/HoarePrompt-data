According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. The loop will continue as long as `expression` has more characters to process. At the end of the last iteration, `expression` must have at least 2 characters, and `char` is the second character in the `expression`. Hence, for the loop to execute one more time, `expression` must have at least 3 characters (to provide a third character) and `char` would then correspond to this third character.

State: **`expression` must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `expression`, `stack` contains the characters processed from the previous iteration**
