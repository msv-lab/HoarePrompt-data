According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `expression` string. For the loop to execute, `expression` must contain at least one character. The `stack` starts empty, which means it will be used to check the balance of the brackets during the iterations. When the loop begins, `char` will be assigned the first character in the `expression`.

So, for the loop to execute properly:
- `expression` must have at least 1 character.
- `char` will be the first character of `expression`.

State: **`expression` must have at least 1 character, `char` is the first character of `expression`, `stack` is an empty list `[]`**
