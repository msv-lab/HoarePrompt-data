The variable `brackets` is assigned a dictionary where keys are opening brackets and values are their corresponding closing brackets. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `expression` is a string that may contain characters such as parentheses, brackets, or braces that need to be checked for balance; `stack` is an empty list `[]`, and `brackets` is a dictionary with keys `(`, `{`, `[` mapping to values `)`, `}`, `]` respectively.

Output State: **`expression` is a string that may contain characters such as parentheses, brackets, or braces that need to be checked for balance; `stack` is an empty list `[]`; `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}**
