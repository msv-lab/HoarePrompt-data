Postcondition: ***`expression` has at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `expression`, and `stack` contains the character processed from the previous iteration. If `stack` is empty or the bracket corresponding to `stack.pop()` does not match `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
