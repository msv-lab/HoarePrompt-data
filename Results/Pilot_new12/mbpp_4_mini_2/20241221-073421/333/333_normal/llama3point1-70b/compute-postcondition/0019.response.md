The code snippet `stack.append(char)` adds the variable `char` to the `stack`. Since `char` is the third character in `expression`, it will be appended to the `stack`. The initial state indicates that `char` has a specific value, making it clear what is being added to `stack`. The other variables (`expression`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`expression` must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `expression`, `stack` contains the characters processed from the previous iteration, and `char` has been appended to `stack`.**
