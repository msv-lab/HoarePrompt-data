Postcondition: ***`expression` must have at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `expression`, and `stack` contains the characters processed from the previous iteration. If `char` is in `brackets`, then `char` is appended to `stack`. Otherwise, if `char` is in `brackets.values()`, the function returns False if `stack` is empty or if the last character popped from `stack` does not match `char` according to the `brackets` mapping; otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
