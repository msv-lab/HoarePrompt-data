According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `expression`. Since the `expression` must have at least 1 character, the loop iterates for each character in `expression`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is a character that has already been processed, and `brackets` is a defined pairing. In this case, the loop will access the next character from `expression`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `expression` must have at least 2 characters and `char` must be the next character in the string that follows the last processed character. Therefore, if the last `char` was the first character, the next `char` will be the second character of the `expression`.

State: **`expression` must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the `expression`, and `stack` still contains the character processed from the previous iteration.**
