The `stack` is updated by appending `char`, which is the second character in the `expression`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `expression` must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the `expression`, and `stack` now contains the previous characters plus `char`.

Output State: **`expression` must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in the `expression`, `stack` now contains the previous characters plus `char`.**
