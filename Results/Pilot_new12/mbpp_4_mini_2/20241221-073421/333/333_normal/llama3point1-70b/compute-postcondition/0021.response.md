Postcondition: ***`expression` has at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character in `expression`, and `stack` contains processed characters. If the `stack` is empty or if the last character popped from `stack` does not match `char` according to the `brackets` mapping, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything.***
