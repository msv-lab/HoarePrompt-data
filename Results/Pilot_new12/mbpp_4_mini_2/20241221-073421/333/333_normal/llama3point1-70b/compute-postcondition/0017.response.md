Postcondition: ***`expression` must have at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character in `expression`, and `stack` contains the character processed from the previous iteration. If `char` is in `brackets`, then `stack` now contains the previous characters plus `char`. If `char` is in `brackets.values()` and `stack` is empty or the bracket corresponding to `stack.pop()` does not match `char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, if the brackets properly match, no action is taken.***
