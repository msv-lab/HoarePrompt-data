The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `expression`. `expression` is a string that may contain characters such as parentheses, brackets, or braces that need to be checked for balance. After executing the function body, the following cases can occur: 

- Case 1: The function returns `False`, indicating that a character does not match the conditions to be placed in the 'stack' based on predefined rules.
- Case 2: The function returns `False`.
- Case 3: The function returns `False`.
- Case 4: The function returns `True` if the brackets in `expression` are balanced (indicating that 'stack' is empty) and returns `False` if there are unmatched opening brackets remaining in 'stack'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `expression` and determine if the brackets within the string are balanced, providing specific return values based on the validation of the expression. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter expression, returns True if the brackets in expression are balanced, and returns False for various conditions including unmatched brackets or invalid characters.**
