The function `func_1` checks whether the brackets (parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets) in the provided string `expression` are balanced. It maintains a stack to track opening brackets and ensures that for every closing bracket encountered, there is a corresponding and correctly ordered opening bracket. If the brackets are balanced, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This includes cases with unmatched opening brackets, closed brackets without a matching opening bracket, or an empty input string, which is considered balanced. The function does not handle invalid characters explicitly and assumes input consists only of the specified bracket types or is empty.
