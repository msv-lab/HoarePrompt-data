To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we can analyze the function "func_1" line by line and review its logic.

### Problem Description Summary:
- The function should remove the **first** and **last** occurrence of a given character from a string.

### Program Analysis:
1. **Finding Indices**:
   - `first_index = s.find(ch)`: This finds the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`.
   - `last_index = s.rfind(ch)`: This finds the index of the last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`.

2. **Handling Non-Existent Cases**:
   - The line checking whether `first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index` captures cases where:
     - The character `ch` is not found in the string (both indices are -1).
     - The character exists only once (both indices are the same).
   - In any of these cases, the function returns `s` unchanged. This is correct behavior based on the problem description.

3. **Removing Occurrences**:
   - The important part of the implementation is this line:
     ```python
     return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
     ```
   - This slices the string into three parts:
     - Everything before the first occurrence of `ch` (`s[:first_index]`).
     - Everything between the first occurrence and the last occurrence (not including either occurrence). 
     - Everything after the last occurrence of `ch`.
   - This correctly removes the first and last occurrences as stated in the problem description.

### Assertions:
- The assertions provided in the annotated program check various cases of strings:
  - `func_1('hello', 'l')` results in `'heo'`, which correctly removes the first and last 'l'.
  - `func_1('abcda', 'a')` results in `'bcd'`, which correctly removes both 'a's.
  - `func_1('PHP', 'P')` results in `'H'`, which correctly removes both 'P's.

### Conclusion:
Based on the problem description and the logical flow of the code, the function behaves as intended for all scenarios it is expected to handle. The behavior aligns with the requirements laid out. 

Therefore, the final evaluation is as follows:
Correctness: **True**
