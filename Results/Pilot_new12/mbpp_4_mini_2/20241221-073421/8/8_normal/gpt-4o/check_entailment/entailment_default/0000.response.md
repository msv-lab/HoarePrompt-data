To analyze the program based on the problem description and output hints, let's break this down step-by-step.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a string. 

### Program Code
```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:
```

### Output Hints
The output hints state that:
- The function searches for the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`.
- If either occurrence is not found or if both occurrences are the same, it returns the string unchanged.
- Otherwise, it creates a new string by removing the first and last occurrences of `ch`.

### Evaluation
1. **Understanding Occurrences with Examples**:
   - For `s = 'hello'` and `ch = 'l'`, it returns `heo` (correct).
   - For `s = 'abcda'` and `ch = 'a'`, it returns `bcd` (correct).
   - For `s = 'PHP'` and `ch = 'P'`, it returns `H` (correct).
  
2. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `s = 'aaa'` and `ch = 'a'`, it should return `a` (removing the first and last 'a' results in just one 'a'). The code currently does this correctly since `first_index` and `last_index` would not be the same if there are only 2 occurrences.
   - If `s = 'a'` and `ch = 'a'`, it should return `'a'` unchanged. Code behaves correctly here as well since it encloses the condition where it checks if the `first_index` equals `last_index`.
   - If `s = ''` (an empty string) and `ch = 'x'`, it should return `''`. Although in this case the character won't change anything if it is not found, the function still behaves correctly, returning `s` unchanged.
  
3. **A Problematic Case**:
   - If `s = 'abccba'` and `ch = 'a'`, it should return `bccb`. However, it will correctly return `bcc`. This is correct because of the character 'a' being found at both ends but causing misalignment in the substring returned. The logic causes an error if the character appears at both ends primarily.

### Conclusion
While all functional tests seem to be passing based on initial examples, the function fails to remove both occurrences in scenarios where `ch` is at both ends resulting in unexpected outputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

The code is incorrect; it does not handle the edge case where `ch` occurs at both ends of the string correctly. In such cases, it should include the characters in the middle string correctly instead of removing one.
