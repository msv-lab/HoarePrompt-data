To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the given code against the problem description.

The problem description states that we need to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string.

The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
```

The assertions check the following cases:
1. `func_1('hello', 'l')` should return `'heo'`.
2. `func_1('abcda', 'a')` should return `'bcd'`.
3. `func_1('PHP', 'P')` should return `'H'`.

Now, let's consider whether the implementation correctly handles all potential inputs:

1. The case where the character does not exist in the string: 
   - Example: `func_1('hello', 'x')` should return `'hello'`, which is handled correctly because `first_index` would be `-1`.

2. The case where the character is the same for the first and last occurrence and should return the string without changes:
   - Example: `func_1('a', 'a')` should return `''`. In the logic `first_index == last_index` condition will trigger and return `s`, which is wrong here because both the first and last 'a' should be removed.

3. The case where the string contains multiple characters but the character to be removed is adjacent:
   - Example: `func_1('aaa', 'a')` should return `''` (removing the first 'a' and the last 'a' leaves the empty string), but the code will incorrectly return `a` because `first_index` and `last_index` are the same.

4. The case where the string has only one occurrence of the character:
   - Example: `func_1('xyz', 'y')` should return `'xz'`, which is handled correctly.

Based on this analysis, I found that the program does not handle certain cases correctly, specifically when the only occurrence of `ch` present in the string is to be removed.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.
