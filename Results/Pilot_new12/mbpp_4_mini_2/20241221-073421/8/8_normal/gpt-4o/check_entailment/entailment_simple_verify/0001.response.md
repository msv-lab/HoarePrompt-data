Based on the original assessment and the analysis of the annotated version, the program's behavior aligns with the problem description; however, it does not correctly handle all edge cases, particularly when the character occurs only once in the input string.

The original assessment noted that the program fails in the case of a string with a character occurring only once (e.g., `func_1('abc', 'b')` should return `'ac'`, but the function returns the original string `'abc'`).

The annotated version of the code confirms that the logic around handling the indices of occurrences is correct, but the condition set for returning the original string is too broad. Specifically, it incorrectly processes strings where the character appears only once.

Therefore, the refined assessment of the program's correctness remains unchanged, while the reasoning supports that the program does indeed fail to meet the problem specification in all cases.

Final: **False**
