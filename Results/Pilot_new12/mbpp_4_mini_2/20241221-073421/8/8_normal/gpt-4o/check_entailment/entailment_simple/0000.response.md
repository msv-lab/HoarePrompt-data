Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it has a logical flaw regarding the removal of the first and last occurrences of the specified character.

1. In the code, the condition `if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index)` checks if the character is not found in the string or if it occurs only once. In such cases, it simply returns the original string `s`, which is not what is required according to the problem description. The problem explicitly states that it should remove the first and last occurrence of the character.

2. If the character occurs only once in the string, the expected behavior according to the problem statement would be to remove that single occurrence. However, this program does not handle that case correctlyâ€”it returns the original string instead.

3. The existing slicing logic in the return statement only works correctly when there are at least two occurrences of the character in the string. If `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, the substring will exclude both occurrences, which is incorrect if we only want to remove them when they are both present.

Therefore, since the function fails to remove the character as required in certain cases, it does not satisfy the problem description.
