Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the character `ch` is the same as the first and last occurrence in the case where it appears together. For example, consider the input `s = 'aaa'` and `ch = 'a'`. The expected output should be an empty string `''` after removing both occurrences of 'a'. However, according to the implementation, it would return the string `'a'` because both `first_index` and `last_index` would yield `0` and would satisfy the condition that `first_index != last_index`. Therefore, it fails to remove both occurrences in this scenario, demonstrating incorrect behavior. 

In summary, the program does not handle the case where the first and last occurrences of the character in the `s` are the same but should be removed, thus leading to an incorrect output for such cases.
