Based on the provided problem description and the thorough breakdown of the function `func_1`, we can analyze the program's performance and correctness. 

### Problem Description:
The goal is to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a string.

### Program Behavior:
1. The function uses `s.find(ch)` to find the first occurrence of the character and `s.rfind(ch)` to find the last occurrence.
2. If either index is -1 (the character is not found) or both indices are the same (the character appears only once), the function returns the original string.
3. It constructs a new string that excludes the character at the found indices if both indices are different.

### Original Assessment:
The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect due to its failure in handling cases where a character appears only once in `s` (e.g., `func_1('abc', 'b')` returns `abc` instead of `ac`).

### Annotated Code:
The annotations indicate a clear state of variables and logic flow in the function. They accurately describe how the function processes valid inputs and correctly identifies that the program returns the original string when conditions of non-existence or singular occurrence are met.

### Refinement of Assessment:
Upon review of the logic:
- While the annotations align with the original assessment stating the function's intention and overall structure, they reinforce the notion that the program indeed fails for cases where the character occurs only once.
- Since the function is designed to return the original string when the character doesnâ€™t exist or occurs only once, the assessment that this condition leads to an incorrect output is validated by the annotations.

Given that the provided annotated code states that the function does not fulfill the expected behavior for certain edge cases despite being logically consistent with returning the original string for one occurrence, I conclude that the function does not correctly meet the requirements laid out in the problem description. The requirement is to remove the first and last occurrences, which it does not accomplish in all scenarios described.

Thus, the final assessment is:

Final: **False**
