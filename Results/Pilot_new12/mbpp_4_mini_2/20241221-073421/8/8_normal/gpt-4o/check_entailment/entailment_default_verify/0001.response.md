The original assessment provided a detailed breakdown of the function `func_1`, which is designed to remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a string. The analysis pointed out potential edge cases where the program did not behave as expected, specifically noting that in the case where the character occurs only once, the program fails to remove it and returns the original string instead. 

The output hints further corroborate the original assessment by clarifying that when the first and last occurrences of the character are the same (indicating that the character appears only once), the function does indeed return the string unchanged, which is not the expected behavior per the problem description.

Given these inconsistencies and failures in handling specific cases, I find that the original assessment's conclusion about correctness is valid.

Therefore, based on the reasoning presented, I maintain the original assessment. The program is incorrect due to its failure in the edge case mentioned.

Final: **False**
