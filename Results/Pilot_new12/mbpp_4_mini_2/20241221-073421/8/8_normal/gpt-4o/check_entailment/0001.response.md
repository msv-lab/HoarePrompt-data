To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the logic found in `func_1`. The program aims to remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a given string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. It retrieves the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s` using `s.find(ch)`.
2. It retrieves the index of the last occurrence of the character `ch` in `s` using `s.rfind(ch)`.
3. If either the first or last index is -1 (meaning the character does not exist), or if both indexes are the same (meaning the character only appears once), the function returns the original string.
4. If both indexes differ, the function constructs a new string by omitting the character at both the first and last indexes.

Now, letâ€™s check for potential edge cases and scenarios where the function might fail:

1. **Case: Empty String**
   - Input: `func_1('', 'x')`
   - Expected Output: `''` (since there are no occurrences of 'x')
   - Actual Output: `''` (which is correct)

2. **Case: Character Not in String**
   - Input: `func_1('hello', 'x')`
   - Expected Output: `'hello'`
   - Actual Output: `'hello'` (which is correct)

3. **Case: Character Occurs Only Once**
   - Input: `func_1('abc', 'b')`
   - Expected Output: `'ac'`
   - Actual Output: `'abc'` (because `first_index` and `last_index` will be the same, causing it to return the original string, which is incorrect)

4. **Case: Given character occurs at the start and end**
   - Input: `func_1('aba', 'a')`
   - Expected Output: `''` (removing both occurrences)
   - Actual Output: `''` (which is correct)

5. **Case: Multiple Non-Adjacent Occurrences**
   - Input: `func_1('banana', 'a')`
   - Expected Output: `'bnn'`
   - Actual Output: `'bnn'` (which is correct)

From our analysis, the program fails for edge case 3 (`func_1('abc', 'b')`), where the character only occurs once, causing the function to incorrectly return the original string instead of the expected output.

Thus, based on this failure case, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**
