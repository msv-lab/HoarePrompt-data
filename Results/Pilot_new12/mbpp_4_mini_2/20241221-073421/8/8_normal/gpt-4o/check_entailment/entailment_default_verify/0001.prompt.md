You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the logic found in `func_1`. The program aims to remove the first and last occurrences of a specified character from a given string.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function:

1. It retrieves the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s` using `s.find(ch)`.
2. It retrieves the index of the last occurrence of the character `ch` in `s` using `s.rfind(ch)`.
3. If either the first or last index is -1 (meaning the character does not exist), or if both indexes are the same (meaning the character only appears once), the function returns the original string.
4. If both indexes differ, the function constructs a new string by omitting the character at both the first and last indexes.

Now, letâ€™s check for potential edge cases and scenarios where the function might fail:

1. **Case: Empty String**
   - Input: `func_1('', 'x')`
   - Expected Output: `''` (since there are no occurrences of 'x')
   - Actual Output: `''` (which is correct)

2. **Case: Character Not in String**
   - Input: `func_1('hello', 'x')`
   - Expected Output: `'hello'`
   - Actual Output: `'hello'` (which is correct)

3. **Case: Character Occurs Only Once**
   - Input: `func_1('abc', 'b')`
   - Expected Output: `'ac'`
   - Actual Output: `'abc'` (because `first_index` and `last_index` will be the same, causing it to return the original string, which is incorrect)

4. **Case: Given character occurs at the start and end**
   - Input: `func_1('aba', 'a')`
   - Expected Output: `''` (removing both occurrences)
   - Actual Output: `''` (which is correct)

5. **Case: Multiple Non-Adjacent Occurrences**
   - Input: `func_1('banana', 'a')`
   - Expected Output: `'bnn'`
   - Actual Output: `'bnn'` (which is correct)

From our analysis, the program fails for edge case 3 (`func_1('abc', 'b')`), where the character only occurs once, causing the function to incorrectly return the original string instead of the expected output.

Thus, based on this failure case, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `ch`. It searches for the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If either occurrence is not found (i.e., `ch` does not exist in `s`), or if both occurrences are the same (indicating that `ch` appears only once in `s`), the function returns the string `s` unchanged. Otherwise, it returns a new string created by removing the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s`. The function does not modify the original string `s` and handles cases where `s` might not contain `ch`, as well as where `ch` appears only once.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
