The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `ch`. It searches for the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If either occurrence is not found (i.e., `ch` does not exist in `s`), or if both occurrences are the same (indicating that `ch` appears only once in `s`), the function returns the string `s` unchanged. Otherwise, it returns a new string created by removing the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s`. The function does not modify the original string `s` and handles cases where `s` might not contain `ch`, as well as where `ch` appears only once.
