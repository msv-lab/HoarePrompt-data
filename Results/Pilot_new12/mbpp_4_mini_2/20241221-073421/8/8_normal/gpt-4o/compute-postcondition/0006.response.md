The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. Here, `s` is a string, and `ch` is a string of length 1 (a single character). 

Based on the execution of the function body, there are two cases to consider:
- **Case 1**: The function returns the string `s` unchanged.
- **Case 2**: The function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrence of the character `ch` removed, utilizing appropriate slicing of the string by determining the indices of the first and last occurrences of `ch`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `ch`, and return the string either unchanged or modified by removing the first and last occurrences of `ch`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`, returns the string `s` unchanged or returns `s` with the first and last occurrence of `ch` removed.**
