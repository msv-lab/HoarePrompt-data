Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and both `first_index` and `last_index` are not -1, and they are not equal to each other (i.e., `first_index` is less than `last_index`).***
