Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. Either `first_index` is -1, indicating `ch` is not found in `s`, or `last_index` is -1, indicating `ch` is not found in `s`, or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, indicating `ch` occurs only once in `s`.***
