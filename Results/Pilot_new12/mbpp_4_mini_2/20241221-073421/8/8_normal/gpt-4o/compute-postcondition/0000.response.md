`first_index` is assigned the value of `s.find(ch)`, which returns the first index of the substring `ch` in the string `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, and `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
