The value of `last_index` is assigned the value of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` based on the `rfind` method. If `ch` is found in `s`, `last_index` will be a non-negative index, while if `ch` is not present in `s`, `last_index` will be -1. The values of `s`, `ch`, and `first_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.**
