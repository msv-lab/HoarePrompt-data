Correctness: **False**

The program fails to meet the problem description because it does not remove the last occurrence of the specified character `char`, as requested. Instead, it only removes the first occurrence, or, if `char` occurs only once, it removes that single occurrence. The relevant logic in the code is as follows:

1. When `char` appears multiple times: The lines that handle this case (`return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]`) aim to remove the first occurrence, but they incorrectly preserve the characters up to the last occurrence without removing the last occurrence itself.

2. When `char` appears only once: The code correctly removes that single occurrence, but it does not fulfill the requirement of also handling the last occurrence.

To further clarify, the requirement explicitly states to remove both the first and last occurrences of the character, which this implementation does not adhere to. Therefore, it does not satisfy the stated problem description for all cases, leading to an incorrect assessment of the function's behavior.
