Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the input string `s` is empty. In this situation, both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` will be -1. As per the current logic, the function would return the empty string unchanged, but the problem description does not specify how to handle this case. Additionally, if `char` does not exist in `s`, the program correctly returns `s` unchanged; however, it does not adequately differentiate a string that contains no occurrences of `char` when `s` itself is empty. Thus, it incorrectly assumes that returning the unchanged empty string fulfills the requirements without explicitly addressing this edge case.
