The annotated code provides a detailed breakdown of the function's behavior at various points, confirming the logic as follows:

1. **Finding Occurrences**: The annotations confirm that the function correctly identifies the first and last occurrence of the character with `s.find(char)` and `s.rfind(char)`, respectively.
  
2. **Single Occurrence Case**: When `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, the function correctly removes that single instance using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, as noted in the annotation.

3. **Multiple Occurrences Case**: In the scenario where the character occurs more than once, the annotation highlights that the function constructs the output string by combining:
   - The part of the string before the first occurrence,
   - The substring between the first and last occurrences, and 
   - The part of the string after the last occurrence.

4. **No Occurrence**: If the character is not present, the function returns the string unchanged, which is also correct.

The original assessment pointed out that the function may not work correctly in the case of repeated identical characters (like "aaa" with `char` as "a"). This is substantiated by both the original analysis and the annotations, emphasizing that it does not handle the boundaries correctly when creating the output string by concatenating slices, leading to potential unexpected results.

The annotations align well with the original assessment, supporting the conclusion that although the function handles typical cases correctly, it fails to manage cases with repeating characters properly, which is critical to the problem description aiming to remove both the first and last occurrences accurately.

Final: **False**
