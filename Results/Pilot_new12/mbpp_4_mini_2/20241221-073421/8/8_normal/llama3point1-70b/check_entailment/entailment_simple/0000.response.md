Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to remove the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a given string.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the program correctly implements the requirements:

1. **Finding Occurrences:** 
   - The program uses `s.find(char)` to locate the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`, and `s.rfind(char)` to find the last occurrence. This aligns with the problem description, which states that the function must identify these occurrences.

2. **Removing Occurrences:**
   - If `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, this indicates that the character occurs only once in the string. In this case, the program correctly removes that single occurrence using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, effectively fulfilling the description's requirement by removing the only instance of the specified character.
   - If `first_occurrence` is not equal to `last_occurrence`, it confirms that the character appears at least twice in the string. The program constructs a new string by concatenating:
     - The part of the string before the first occurrence,
     - The part of the string between the first and last occurrence (with the first occurrence removed),
     - The part of the string after the last occurrence. 
   This effectively removes both the first and last occurrences of the specified character, which is precisely what the problem demands.

3. **Handling Absence of Character:**
   - If the character is not found (i.e., both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` return -1), the program simply returns the original string `s`. This is also behaviorally correct because if the character does not exist in the string, there are no occurrences to remove.

In summary, the program is designed correctly according to the problem description to remove the first and last occurrence of a character in all specified scenarios. Thus, it is correct, and the output of the verification is "True".
