To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's consider the functionality of the program and possible edge cases:

### Given Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that removes the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a string.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Finding Occurrences**: 
   - The program correctly identifies the index of the first and last occurrence of the specified character using `find()` and `rfind()`.

2. **Removing the Character**:
   - If both occurrences are found (`first_occurrence` != -1 and `last_occurrence` != -1), the program has two cases:
     - If `first_occurrence == last_occurrence`: This means the character appears only once. The program uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` which correctly removes that character.
     - If `first_occurrence != last_occurrence`: The program constructs a new string that removes the character at the first and last indices correctly.

3. **No Character Present**: 
   - If the character is not found at all in the string, the program returns the original string, which is correct behavior.

### Edge Cases:
- An empty string: The program will return an empty string since there are no occurrences.
- A string with only one character: If the character matches, it will return an empty string (correct behavior); if it doesn’t match, it returns the original string (correct).
- A string where every character is the same and that character is the target: The program will remove the first and last occurrence correctly, as it handles this scenario.

### Potential Issue:
However, let’s consider the following input which is not handled correctly:
- For the input `s = "abcde"` and `char = "z"` (a character not in the string), the program returns `"abcde"`. This behavior is correct.
- Now consider the input `s = "aaa"` and `char = "a"`. The expected output would be an empty string, yet the code has an issue where it may not remove the last occurrence because `s[:0] + s[0+1:0] + s[0+1:]` evaluates in a way that does not handle consecutive identical characters properly, probably leading to unexpected behavior.

### Conclusion:
After evaluating the implementation, the program handles most cases correctly. However, it might return incorrect behavior in a certain scenario with repeated characters. Specifically, issues arise when the first and last indices are those of the same character in a sequence, leading to potential flaws when constructing the output string.

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements for every potential case. 

Correctness: **False**
