Output State: **The program returns the string 's' with the first occurrence of 'char' removed, which is represented by the slice `s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]`, where 'first_occurrence' and 'last_occurrence' are the indices of 'char' in 's' and are not equal, confirming that 'char' appears at least twice in 's'.**
