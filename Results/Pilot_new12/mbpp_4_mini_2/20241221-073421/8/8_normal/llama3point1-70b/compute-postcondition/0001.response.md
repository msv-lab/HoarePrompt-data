The variable `last_occurrence` is assigned the value of `s.rfind(char)`, which returns the highest index in `s` where the substring `char` is found. The value of `last_occurrence` will be an integer representing this index or -1 if `char` is not found in `s`. The values of `s`, `char`, and `first_occurrence` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character that exists in `s`, `first_occurrence` is an integer representing the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, `last_occurrence` is an integer representing the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`.**
