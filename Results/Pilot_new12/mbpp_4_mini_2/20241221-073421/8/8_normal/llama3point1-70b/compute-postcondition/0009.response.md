The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `char`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `char` is a single character that exists within the string `s`. 

- In Case 1, if `char` appears only once in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed.
- In Case 2, if `char` appears at least twice in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed, while preserving all other parts of the string.
- In Case 3, the function returns the string `s` as it meets specific conditions related to the occurrences of `char`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `char`, and return a modified version of `s` based on the occurrences of `char` within it. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s` which is a string and `char` which is a single character. It returns a modified string by removing the first occurrence of `char` based on the number of occurrences in `s`.**
