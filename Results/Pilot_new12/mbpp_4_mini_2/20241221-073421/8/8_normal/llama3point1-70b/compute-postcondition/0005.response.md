Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `char` is a single character that exists in `s`, `first_occurrence` is an integer representing the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, `last_occurrence` is an integer representing the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`. The current value of `first_occurrence` is not equal to the current value of `last_occurrence`, and both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` are not -1.***
