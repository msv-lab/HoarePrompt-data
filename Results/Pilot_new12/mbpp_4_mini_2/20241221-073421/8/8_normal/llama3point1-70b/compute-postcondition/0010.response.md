Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a single character `char`. It identifies the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s`. Depending on the positions of these occurrences, it performs the following actions: 

1. If `char` appears only once in `s` (when the indices of its first and last occurrences are equal), it returns a new string with that single occurrence of `char` removed. 
2. If `char` appears multiple times (when the first and last indices are different), it returns a new string where only the first occurrence of `char` is removed, preserving the remaining characters in `s`. 
3. If `char` does not exist in `s` (if `first_occurrence` equals -1), it returns `s` unchanged.

The function correctly handles scenarios where `s` may or may not contain `char` and properly adjusts the string based on the character's occurrences, ensuring that the output reflects these conditions. However, the function does not address the case where `s` is empty; in such cases, it will still return `s` (which is an empty string) since no indices will be found. Thus, this functionality is handled uniformly for all edge cases including single occurrences, multiple occurrences, and absence of `char` in `s`.**
