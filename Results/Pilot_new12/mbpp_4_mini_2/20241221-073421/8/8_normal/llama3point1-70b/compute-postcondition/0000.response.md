The variable `first_occurrence` is assigned the value of `s.find(char)`, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s`. Since `char` is a single character that exists in `s`, `first_occurrence` will be a non-negative integer representing the index of that character. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character that exists in `s`, `first_occurrence` is an integer representing the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`.**
