Explanation: The function attempts to find the index of the first occurrence of the specified `element` in the provided `array`. If `element` is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index; if not found, it raises a `ValueError`, which is caught, and the function returns a tuple containing `False` and -1. The implementation suitably handles the indicated behavior, and it handles the case of missing elements correctly. It will always provide the correct output as per the problem description. 

There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios described in the problem statement that the function does not handle, given that it is assumed the input will always be valid.

Correctness: **True**.
