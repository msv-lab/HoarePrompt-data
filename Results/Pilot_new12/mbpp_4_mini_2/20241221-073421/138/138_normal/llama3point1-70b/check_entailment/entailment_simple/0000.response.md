Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Let's break down how the program aligns with each aspect of the requirements:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes in an `array` (a list of elements) and an `element`. 

2. **Presence Check**: The program uses the `index()` method of the list to determine if the `element` exists within the `array`. If the `element` is found, the method returns its index, allowing the program to confirm its presence.

3. **Return Values**: 
   - When the `element` is found, the program correctly returns a tuple `(True, index)`, complying with the requirement to indicate both the presence of the `element` and its index position.
   - If the `element` is not found, the `ValueError` exception is caught in the `except` block, and the program appropriately returns `(False, -1)`. This matches the requirement to return a boolean indicating absence and to return -1 for the index.

4. **Robustness for Valid Inputs**: The problem description specifies that the input will be valid (i.e., `array` will be a list and `element` can be of any type). The implementation makes no assumptions about the structure of the list or the type of elements contained within itâ€”aligning perfectly with this specification.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements laid out in the problem description. Therefore, Correctness: **True**.
