Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. The program checks for the presence of the specified `element` in the `array` and handles both cases (found or not found) appropriately. 

Furthermore, the annotated version of the code provides accurate insights into the states of the program and confirms the correctness of the logic implemented within the function. It clearly states that if the `element` is found, the program returns `True` and the corresponding index; if not found, it correctly raises a `ValueError` and returns `False` and -1. 

The assessment also acknowledges that edge cases, such as an empty list or the element not being of the same type as any in the list, are handled correctly, aligning with the problem description. Thus, the combination of the original assessment, annotations, and the problem requirements supports the conclusion that the program is indeed correct.

Overall, the rationale provided in both the original assessment and the annotated version align with the expectations set forth in the problem description, reinforcing that the implementation is correct.
