Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` operates correctly according to the problem description. It successfully checks if a given `element` is present in the `array`, returns the appropriate boolean and index, and handles edge cases effectively:

1. **Empty Array**: If the input array is empty, the function will return `(False, -1)`, which matches the expected behavior.
2. **First Occurrence**: In scenarios where the element appears multiple times, the function correctly returns the index of the first occurrence.
3. **Type Handling**: It correctly returns `(False, -1)` when the element does not match the type or value of any items in the array.
4. **Error Handling**: The use of a `try-except` block to catch the `ValueError` is a valid approach for handling non-existent elements while fulfilling the problem's requirements.

The output hints reinforce these points, confirming that the function reliably indicates successful or unsuccessful searches with the correct return values. Thus, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description, and the initial assessment of correctness remains justified.
