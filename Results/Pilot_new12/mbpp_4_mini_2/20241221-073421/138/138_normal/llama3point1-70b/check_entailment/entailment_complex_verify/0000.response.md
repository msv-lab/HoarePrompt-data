Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the provided program correctly meets the problem description requirements. The function `func_1` takes in an array and an element, and it successfully checks if the element exists in the array using the `index()` method. The annotated version confirms this behavior by specifying the outcomes when the element is found or not found. 

1. When the element is present, the function returns `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the first occurrence of the element. This aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem statement.
2. When the element is absent, it raises a `ValueError`, which is caught in the `except` block, leading to the return value `(False, -1)`, as required.

The annotations clarify that the function handles all specified scenarios, including the handling of valid inputs. Since the assumptions about input validity are stated and supported by the annotations, the implementation indeed satisfies the condition laid out in the problem description.

Thus, the program exhibits correct behavior according to the problem's requirements, justifying the conclusion that it operates correctly.
