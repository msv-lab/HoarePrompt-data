Correctness: **True**

The provided function correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It checks if the given `element` is present in the `array`. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` and returns a tuple with `False` and -1.

All edge cases are handled properly:
- If the array is empty, it correctly returns `(False, -1)` since the element cannot be found.
- If the element appears multiple times in the array, it returns the index of the first occurrence, which is expected behavior as per the description.
- If the element is of a different type (e.g., searching for a string in an array of integers), it will also return `(False, -1)` as it won't find the element.

No examples of failure were identified, so based on the problem description and the analysis of edge cases, the code functions as required.
