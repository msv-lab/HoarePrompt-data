Final: **True** 

The program correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description by successfully checking for the presence of an element in an array and returning the appropriate results in a tuple format. The annotated version supports this assessment, demonstrating that the program appropriately handles both cases: when an element is found and when it is not. The treatment of a `ValueError` as a sign that the element is absent aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem statement. Thus, the original assessment correctly identifies the program's correctness.
