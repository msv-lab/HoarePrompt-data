You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: array is a list of elements, and element can be of any type.
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return True, index
        #The program returns True indicating the presence of 'element' in 'array', along with the corresponding index of its first occurrence.
    except (ValueError):
        return False, -1
        #The program returns False and -1
    #State of the program after the try-except block has been executed: `array` is a list of elements, `element` can be of any type. If the `element` is found, the function returns `True` and the index of its first occurrence; if the `element` is not found, the function returns `False` and -1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list called `array` and an element of any type. It attempts to find the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `array`. If the `element` is found, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the `element` is not found, it raises a `ValueError` and subsequently returns a tuple containing `False` and -1. The function handles missing values by returning -1 for the index when the element does not exist in the array, indicating the search was unsuccessful. Additionally, it does not account for any modifications to the array after the search or any side effects resulting from finding or not finding the element.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
