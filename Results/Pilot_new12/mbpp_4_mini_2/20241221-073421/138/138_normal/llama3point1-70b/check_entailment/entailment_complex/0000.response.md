Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. It takes an array and an element as inputs, and successfully determines if the element is present in the array. Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Element Presence**: The program uses the `index()` method of the list to check for the presence of the element. If the element is found, it returns `True` alongside the index of the first occurrence, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Return Value**: If the element is not found, the program raises a `ValueError`, which is caught by the `except` block. It then returns `False` and `-1`, precisely as required in the problem description when the element is absent.

3. **Tuple Return Type**: The function consistently returns a tuple containing two values: a boolean indicating the presence of the element and the index (or -1 if not found), aligning with the expected output format.

4. **Handling Valid Inputs**: The program accurately assumes that it will receive valid inputs based on the problem description, which simplifies verification and obviates concerns about invalid types or empty arrays.

Overall, the function behaves as intended in all specified scenarios, confirming its correctness in adhering to the problem description.
