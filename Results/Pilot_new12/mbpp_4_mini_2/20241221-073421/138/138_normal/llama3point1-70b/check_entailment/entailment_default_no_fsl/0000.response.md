Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input, then searches for the element in the array. If the element is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the first occurrence of the element. If the element is not found, the program raises a `ValueError` which is appropriately handled by returning a tuple with `False` and `-1`. 

Since the problem description does not specify any edge cases involving empty lists or types of elements in the array and assumes valid input, the implementation meets the requirements for every potential case as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
