Correctness: **True**. 

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes in an array and an element, checks if the element is present in the array using the `index()` method, and returns a tuple containing a boolean value indicating presence and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns `(False, -1)`. 

This implementation correctly handles all potential cases, including:
- The element being in the array at various positions (first, middle, last).
- The element not being in the array at all.
- An empty array.
- Handling of duplicates by returning the index of the first occurrence.

Since the program appears to perform correctly across all these scenarios, it is accurate according to the requirements stated in the problem description.
