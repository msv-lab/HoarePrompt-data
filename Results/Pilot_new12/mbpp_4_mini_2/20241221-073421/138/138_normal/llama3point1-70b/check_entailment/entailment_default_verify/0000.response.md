Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality as specified in the problem description. It takes an array and an element, checks for the presence of the element using the `index()` method, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is found along with its index or -1 if it is not found. The output hints confirm that the function works as intended, including proper handling of the ValueError when the element is not present in the array. Since the function adheres to the requirements and covers all outlined scenarios effectively, the assessment of correctness as **True** stands justified.
