Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list called `array` and an element of any type. It attempts to find the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `array`. If the `element` is found, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the `element` is not found, it raises a `ValueError` and subsequently returns a tuple containing `False` and -1. The function handles missing values by returning -1 for the index when the element does not exist in the array, indicating the search was unsuccessful. Additionally, it does not account for any modifications to the array after the search or any side effects resulting from finding or not finding the element.**
