The program could raise a `ValueError` if the specified `element` is not found in the `array` when attempting to get its index with `array.index(element)`. If the `element` is present in `array`, the function returns `True` along with the index of its first occurrence. If the `element` is not found, the function handles this by returning `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the output state is: **`array` is a list of elements, `element` can be of any type. If the `element` is found, the function returns `True` and the index of its first occurrence; if the `element` is not found, the function returns `False` and -1.**
