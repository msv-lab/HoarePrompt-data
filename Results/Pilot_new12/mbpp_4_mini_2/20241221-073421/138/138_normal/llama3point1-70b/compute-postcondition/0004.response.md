The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `element`. The parameter `array` is a list of elements, and the parameter `element` can be of any type. After executing the function, if the `element` is found in the `array`, the function returns `True` along with the index of the first occurrence of the `element`. If the `element` is not found in the `array`, the function returns `False` and -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of elements and an element of any type, and to return whether the element is present in the list along with its index or indicate it is absent. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `array` and an `element` of any type; returns `True` and the index of the `element` if found, or returns `False` and -1 if not found.**
