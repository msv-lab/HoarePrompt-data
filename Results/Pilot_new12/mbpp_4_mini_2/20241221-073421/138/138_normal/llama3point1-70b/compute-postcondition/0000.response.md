The `index` variable is assigned the position of the `element` within the `array`. The `array` can contain elements of any type, and the `index` will be the first occurrence of `element` in `array`. Since the previous state of `index` is unknown and only `array` along with `element` is given, the result is that `index` will now hold the value corresponding to the first occurrence index of `element` in `array`, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`array` is a list of elements, and `index` is the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `array`.**
