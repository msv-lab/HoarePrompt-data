According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration (if the loop were to run), `index` would be the last index of the array and `value` would be the last element of the array. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the `arr` must have at least 1 element, and the `index` must start at 0 with `value` being the first element of the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element in the list**
