Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements of any type, and `element`, which can also be of any type. It iterates through `arr` to check for the presence of `element`. If `element` is found, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element`. If `element` is not found in the list after checking all elements, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and -1, indicating that the element does not exist in `arr`. The returned index is always either a valid index where the element is found or -1 if the element is not found. Edge cases such as an empty list are handled implicitly by returning `False` and -1, as the loop does not execute in that case. There is no potential issue with handling `None` values or any specific types of elements, as the equality check is done using `==`, which is defined for all types.**
