Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the specified functionality as described in the problem statement. It checks for the presence of an element in an array and returns a tuple with a boolean indicating whether the element is found, along with its index, or -1 if it is not present. 

The output hints reinforce this, stating that the function accommodates elements of any type and operates correctly for valid inputs, which we are assuming. The assertions provided are verified and consistently return expected results. Additionally, the program implicitly handles edge cases like an empty list by returning `(False, -1)`, which aligns with the expected behavior when no elements can be found.

Thus, after reviewing the code, problem description, output hints, and the original assessment, I conclude that the program's correctness remains validated.
