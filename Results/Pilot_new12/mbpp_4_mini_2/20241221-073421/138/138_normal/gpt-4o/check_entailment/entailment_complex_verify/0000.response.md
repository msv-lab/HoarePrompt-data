The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** because it does not explicitly handle the case of an empty input array. However, the annotated code explains that if the input list is empty, the loop does not execute, resulting in the function returning `(False, -1)` without any errors. This means the function behaves correctly for this edge case, as it implicitly handles the empty list.

Additionally, the function satisfies the problem description by returning a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the list and providing the correct index or -1 when the element is not found. 

Since the annotations clarify that the program does indeed handle an empty list correctly and confirms that it meets the requirements specified in the original problem description, I conclude that the original assessment is too harsh and inaccurate. 

Final: **True**
