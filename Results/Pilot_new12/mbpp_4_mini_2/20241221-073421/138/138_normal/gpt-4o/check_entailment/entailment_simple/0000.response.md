The given program does not meet the problem description's requirements entirely. Here's the analysis:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(arr, element)` is expected to return a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index of that element (or -1 if it is not found).

2. **Correct Behavior**:
   - The function correctly iterates through the provided list `arr` and checks if each `value` is equal to `element`.
   - If a match is found, it returns `(True, index)`, which aligns with the requirement.
   - If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns `(False, -1)`, which also meets the requirement.

3. **Issue**: The explanations in the comments are slightly misleading:
   - The comment, "if `element` is not found, the function returns `None` and `index` is equal to the length of `arr`," is incorrect. 
   - Thereâ€™s no scenario in the program where `None` is returned; the function always returns a tuple: `(False, -1)`. 

Despite the comment confusion, the program's logic correctly captures the intended behavior described. Thus, it meets the problem description requirements.

Correctness: **True**
