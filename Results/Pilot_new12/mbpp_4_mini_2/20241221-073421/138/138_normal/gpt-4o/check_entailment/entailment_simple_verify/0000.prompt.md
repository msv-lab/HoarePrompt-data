You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the input array is empty correctly. According to the problem description, the function must return a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). If the array is empty, the function should return `(False, -1)` because the element cannot possibly be found. However, the program does not explicitly check for this condition. 

For example, calling `func_1([], 5)` would return `(False, -1)`, but that scenario is not specifically handled and is specially critical for corner cases such as an empty list. Thus, it is important to explicitly check for that in addition to the general search logic. 

Since the program could fail if given an empty array as input, which is a valid edge case, the correctness is deemed false.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and element can be of any type.
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return True, index
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements, the function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr` if it exists; if `element` is not found, the function returns `None` and `index` is equal to the length of `arr`, which means the loop executed for all elements in `arr`.
    return False, -1
    #The program returns False, indicating that the element was not found in the list 'arr', and -1, which signifies that the index is not applicable since the element does not exist.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
