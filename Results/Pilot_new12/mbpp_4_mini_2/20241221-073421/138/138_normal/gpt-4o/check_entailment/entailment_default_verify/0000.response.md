The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it does not explicitly check for the case where the input array is empty. However, based on the provided output hints, it states that edge cases such as an empty list are handled implicitly because when the array is empty, the loop does not execute, resulting in the function returning `(False, -1)` as expected.

Therefore, the function behaves correctly by design in handling the case of an empty list, as it adheres to the problem's requirements. The output hints further clarify that the function's logic performs as intended without additional checks for specific edge cases, which are managed by the condition of the loop.

Given the analysis, it is clear that the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
