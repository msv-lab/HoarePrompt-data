Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element, checks for the existence of the element within the array, and returns a tuple indicating whether the element is present and its index, or -1 if it is not found.

The annotated code supports this assessment effectively. It clearly outlines the function's behavior before and after the loop, confirming that if the element is found, it returns the correct index. If not found, it returns `(False, -1)`, which aligns with the expected behavior from the problem description.

Moreover, edge cases, such as an empty list, are handled correctly since if the array is empty, the loop does not execute and it will directly return `(False, -1)`. The overall logic of the function, as reinforced by the annotations, demonstrates that it correctly adheres to the specified requirements.

Thus, the integrated evidence from the problem description, original assessment, and annotations leads to the conclusion that the program is indeed correct.
