Explanation: The code appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element, iterates through the array, and checks for the presence of the given element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element; if not, it returns `(False, -1)`. 

The output hints align with the functioning of the code, confirming that it handles the presence and absence of elements correctly. It also implicitly handles edge cases such as empty arrays, as the function would return `(False, -1)` if the list is empty. Given that the equality check is performed using `==`, it accommodates any type of elements.

Additionally, testing with examples confirms the functionality, such as for the cases:
- Searching for `31` in the first provided array yields `(True, 3)` which is correct.
- Searching for `61` in another array yields `(True, 7)` which is also correct.
- Searching for `48` yields `(True, 6)` which is accurate.

There are no identified edge cases or missing logic that would cause the code to fail under the established assumptions about valid input. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
