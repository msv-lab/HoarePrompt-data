Based on the provided program, problem description, original assessment, and the annotations, I will assess the correctness of the program.

1. **Problem Description**: The function is intended to take an array and an element, returning a tuple that indicates whether the element is in the array (as a boolean) and the index of the element, or -1 if the element is not found.

2. **Program Logic**: 
   - The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, checks if the current value matches the element, and returns a tuple with `(True, index)` if found, otherwise returns `(False, -1)` after finishing the loop.
   - The logic handles all specified cases correctly. 

3. **Assertions**: The assertions verify the expected outcomes of the function. All provided cases return the expected results as described:
   - `(True, 3)` for the input array where 31 exists at index 3.
   - `(True, 7)` for 61 at index 7.
   - `(True, 6)` for 48 at index 6.

4. **Annotations**: 
   - The annotations correctly describe the states of the program at different points. Specifically, they accurately mention that if the element is found, the function returns True and the appropriate index, and if not found, it returns False and -1.
   - However, there is an inconsistency in the second part of the annotation which suggests that the return statements are `None` and `index` is the length of `arr`, which is incorrect. The function actually returns `(False, -1)`.

5. **Final Assessment**: 
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and successfully passes all assertions. 
   - The error noted in the annotations does not impact the correctness of the function, as the intended behavior is still being achieved as per the problem statement.

Therefore, I conclude that the program meets the problem description requirements and the original assessment's correctness claim holds true despite the slight inaccuracy in the annotations.

Final: **True**
