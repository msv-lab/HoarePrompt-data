The provided Python program is a function intended to fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description. Letâ€™s analyze whether it meets these requirements:

1. **Function Definition and Parameters**: 
   - The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `arr`, which is expected to be a list, and `element`, which can be of any type. This matches the problem description that indicates the function should take in an array and an element.

2. **Iterating through the List**:
   - The `for` loop iterates through the list using `enumerate`, allowing us to get both the index and the value for each element in the list. This is appropriate for checking each item against the `element`.

3. **Checking for Element Presence**:
   - The condition `if value == element:` checks for equality. If the element is found, the function returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `index` is the position of the found element. This aligns perfectly with the requirement to indicate if the element exists and its index.

4. **Handling the Case Where Element is Not Found**:
   - If the loop completes without finding the `element`, the function returns the tuple `(False, -1)`. This satisfies the problem description's requirement to return `-1` when the element is not found. 

5. **Edge Case Consideration**:
   - As mentioned in the comments, if `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the function directly returns `(False, -1)`. This behavior is consistent with the specification in the problem description.

6. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function behaves as specified for at least some test cases.

Given all of the above points, the function behaves as intended by the problem description for all specified cases. It accurately identifies the presence of an element in the list and provides the correct index or indicates absence accordingly.

Therefore, the correctness of the program can be concluded as follows:

Correctness: **True**
