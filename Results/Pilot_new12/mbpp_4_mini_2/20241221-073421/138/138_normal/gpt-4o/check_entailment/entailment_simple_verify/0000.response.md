The original assessment indicates that the program's correctness is **False** due to its failure to explicitly check for an empty input array, despite returning the correct result `(False, -1)` when passed an empty array as input. The problem description requires that if the element is not found in the array or if the array is empty, the function should return `(False, -1)`. The function does return this outcome correctly, but the absence of an explicit check for the empty array was the basis of the original assessment.

However, upon reviewing the annotated version, it clarifies that the function does indeed handle the empty array scenario correctly by returning `(False, -1)` after completing the enumeration of an empty list without finding the target element. The code execution flow confirms that it would appropriately return `(False, -1)` when an empty list is provided because the loop simply doesnâ€™t execute and proceeds to the return statement.

Given that the assumptions state valid input conditions, this behavior is operationally correct and aligns with the problem's requirements.

Therefore, since the function behaves correctly even though it lacks an explicit empty check, I change the assessment to indicate that the program meets the requirements of the problem description.

Final: **True**
