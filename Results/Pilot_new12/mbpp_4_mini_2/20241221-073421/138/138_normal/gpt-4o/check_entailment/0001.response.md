Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element, checks if the element is in the array, and returns a tuple indicating whether the element is present and its index, or -1 if it is not found. 

The code uses a loop to enumerate over the array, comparing each value with the given element. If a match is found, it returns `(True, index)`, and if no match is found after checking all elements, it returns `(False, -1)`.

I reviewed the assertions provided and they all return the expected results:

1. For the input `([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31)`, it returns `(True, 3)`, which is correct since 31 is located at index 3.
2. For the input `([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61)`, it returns `(True, 7)`, correct as 61 is at index 7.
3. For the input `([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48)`, it returns `(True, 6)`, which is accurate with 48 at index 6.

Since I can't find any edge cases where this function would fail, and it meets all described requirements for the function, I conclude that the program is correct. The logic for returning -1 if the element is not present is adequately handled by the final return statement. All potential cases are accounted for.
