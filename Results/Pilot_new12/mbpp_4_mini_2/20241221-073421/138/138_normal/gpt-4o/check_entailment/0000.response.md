Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case where the input array is empty correctly. According to the problem description, the function must return a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). If the array is empty, the function should return `(False, -1)` because the element cannot possibly be found. However, the program does not explicitly check for this condition. 

For example, calling `func_1([], 5)` would return `(False, -1)`, but that scenario is not specifically handled and is specially critical for corner cases such as an empty list. Thus, it is important to explicitly check for that in addition to the general search logic. 

Since the program could fail if given an empty array as input, which is a valid edge case, the correctness is deemed false.
