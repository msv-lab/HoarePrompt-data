You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
assert func_1([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31) == (True, 3)
assert func_1([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61) == (True, 7)
assert func_1([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48) == (True, 6)

def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element, checks if the element is in the array, and returns a tuple indicating whether the element is present and its index, or -1 if it is not found. 

The code uses a loop to enumerate over the array, comparing each value with the given element. If a match is found, it returns `(True, index)`, and if no match is found after checking all elements, it returns `(False, -1)`.

I reviewed the assertions provided and they all return the expected results:

1. For the input `([11, 23, 58, 31, 56, 77, 43, 12, 65, 19], 31)`, it returns `(True, 3)`, which is correct since 31 is located at index 3.
2. For the input `([12, 32, 45, 62, 35, 47, 44, 61], 61)`, it returns `(True, 7)`, correct as 61 is at index 7.
3. For the input `([9, 10, 17, 19, 22, 39, 48, 56], 48)`, it returns `(True, 6)`, which is accurate with 48 at index 6.

Since I can't find any edge cases where this function would fail, and it meets all described requirements for the function, I conclude that the program is correct. The logic for returning -1 if the element is not present is adequately handled by the final return statement. All potential cases are accounted for.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements of any type, and `element`, which can also be of any type. It iterates through `arr` to check for the presence of `element`. If `element` is found, the function returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element`. If `element` is not found in the list after checking all elements, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and -1, indicating that the element does not exist in `arr`. The returned index is always either a valid index where the element is found or -1 if the element is not found. Edge cases such as an empty list are handled implicitly by returning `False` and -1, as the loop does not execute in that case. There is no potential issue with handling `None` values or any specific types of elements, as the equality check is done using `==`, which is defined for all types.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
