Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that correctly accepts an array and an element. Using a loop, it iterates through the array to check for the presence of the element. 

1. If the element is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the first occurrence of the element.
2. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`, which signifies that the element does not exist in the array.
3. The function handles an empty array implicitly, returning `(False, -1)` as expected since the loop does not execute for an empty list.

No edge cases are missed, such as checking different data types, including `None`, since the code uses the equality operator, which works for all data types in Python. 

Furthermore, the assertions in the code demonstrate that various test cases are handled correctly.

Therefore, the code is correct in all cases described, leading to the conclusion of correctness being `True`.
