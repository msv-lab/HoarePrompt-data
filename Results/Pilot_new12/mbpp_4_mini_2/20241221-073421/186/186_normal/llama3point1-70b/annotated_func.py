#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the bitwise 'and' of corresponding elements from tuples tup1 and tup2.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `tup1` and `tup2`, which are tuples. It returns a new tuple consisting of the bitwise 'and' of corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will only compute the bitwise 'and' for the elements up to the length of the shorter tuple, effectively discarding any excess elements. The function does not handle cases where non-integer elements are present in the tuples, which may result in a TypeError during the '&' operation.
