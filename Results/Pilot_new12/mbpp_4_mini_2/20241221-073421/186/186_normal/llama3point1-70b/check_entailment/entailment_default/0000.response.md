The provided function `func_1` operates on two tuples and performs a bitwise 'and' operation on their corresponding elements using the `zip` function. It constructs a new tuple from these operations.

According to the output hints, the function only computes the bitwise 'and' for indices up to the length of the shorter tuple, discarding excess elements from the longer tuple. This behavior is consistent with the implementation observed in the code. However, an important aspect pointed out in the hints is that the function does not handle cases where non-integer elements are present in the tuples, which can indeed lead to a TypeError when performing the '&' operation.

Given that the problem description and function implementation do not specify that the function should handle non-integer elements in the input tuples, we can assume the input will always be valid integers. The function does not state any requirements or constraints concerning the nature of tuple elements other than performing the operation as described.

However, since the presence of non-integer elements can cause the function to fail (e.g., `func_1((1, 2), (3, 'a'))` would raise a TypeError), the code does not work as intended in all potential cases. Therefore, it's essential to highlight this flaw based on the output hints that explicitly mention this limitation.

Thus, the function is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The function does not handle cases with non-integer elements in the tuples, which can lead to a TypeError during the '&' operation. For example, if one of the tuples includes a string (e.g., `func_1((1, 2), (3, 'a'))`), it will raise an exception, thereby failing to meet the problem description's requirements for all potential inputs.
