Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to extract the elementwise tuples from the given two tuples, but the provided implementation performs a bitwise 'and' operation on the corresponding elements of the input tuples.

The correct approach based on the description would involve simply returning a tuple of the corresponding elements as they are, or creating a new tuple that may contain the elements paired in tuples, such as `((tup1[i], tup2[i]) for i in range(len(tup1)))`. Instead, the current implementation returns the result of a bitwise operation instead of the 'elementwise' extraction specified in the problem description.

Thus, the program does not adhere to the requirements laid out in the problem description.
