To examine the provided program against the problem description, we look at the function `func_1` which is meant to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. 

The implementation is as follows:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```

This function uses the bitwise AND operator `&` to combine corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. However, the problem statement is vague about what "extract the elementwise and tuples" specifically means. 

1. **Correctness of the Operation**: 
    - The operation `x & y` assumes that both `x` and `y` are integers or have a defined bitwise AND operation. If either tuple contains non-integer types (e.g., strings, lists, etc.), the program would raise a TypeError.
  
2. **Handling Mismatched Lengths**:
    - The use of `zip` will compute the elementwise operation only for the length of the shorter tuple. If one tuple is longer than the other, the additional elements in the longer tuple will be ignored.
  
3. **Return Type**:
    - The function always returns a tuple, but itâ€™s unclear if the problem description allows only for tuples of integers or intends to manage other types.

### Example Cases:
- Correct input: `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4))` gives `(1 & 3, 2 & 4) = (1, 0)`, which works.
- Incorrect input due to type error: `func_1((1, 2), ('a', 4))` would raise `TypeError`.
- Length mismatch: `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))` gives `(1 & 4, 2 & 5) = (0, 0)`, ignoring `3`.

Given these observations, the program fails in the following cases:
- If the tuples contain any non-integer objects, it will raise an error rather than handle the input gracefully.
- If the tuples have different lengths, it doesn't handle what to do with the excess elements.

Hence, based on potential cases where the function does not work as expected, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
