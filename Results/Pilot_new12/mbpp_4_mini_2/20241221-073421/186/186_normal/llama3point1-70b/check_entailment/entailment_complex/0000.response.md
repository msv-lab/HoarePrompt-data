Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description states that the function should extract elementwise tuples from the given two tuples. However, the provided function calculates the bitwise 'and' of the corresponding elements of the two tuples instead of simply extracting the elements as tuples.

Moreover, the function does not return the tuples directly, but rather performs an operation (bitwise 'and'), which is not part of the problem's requirement. Therefore, it does not fulfill the purpose outlined in the problem description. 

In summary, the function's behavior does not align with the request to "extract the elementwise tuples"; it performs an operation on the elements instead. Thus, the program fails to meet the criteria set by the problem statement.
