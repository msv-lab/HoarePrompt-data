Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where non-integer elements are present in the tuples. For example, if `tup1` is `(1, 2, 3)` and `tup2` is `(4, 'a', 6)`, the program will raise a `TypeError` during the '&' operation when it tries to compute `2 & 'a'`. This behavior contradicts the assumption that it will work for all potential cases, as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is not correct for every possible input scenario.
