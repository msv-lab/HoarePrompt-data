To determine if the provided Python program correctly implements the specified functionality based on the problem description, we can analyze the code and evaluate its correctness against a few test cases.

### Problem Description:
We need to write a function to extract elementwise tuples from two provided tuples. 

### Program Analysis:
The provided function `func_1`:
```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))
```
This function takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and uses the `zip()` function to iterate over both tuples simultaneously. For each pair of elements `(x, y)` from the two tuples, it computes the bitwise AND operation `x & y` and constructs a new tuple with the results.

### Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Different Length Tuples:** If `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths, the `zip()` function will only process up to the length of the shorter tuple, which may lead to lost data.
   
   - Example:
     ```python
     tup1 = (1, 2, 3)
     tup2 = (4, 5)
     print(func_1(tup1, tup2))  # Expected: (1 & 4, 2 & 5) -> (0, 0)
     # Actual: (0, 0), Correct output, but data from tup1[2] is ignored.
     ```

2. **Empty Tuples:** If one or both tuples are empty, the output should correctly be an empty tuple.
   - Example:
     ```python
     print(func_1((), ()))      # Expected: ()
     print(func_1((), (1, 2)))  # Expected: ()
     print(func_1((1, 2), ()))  # Expected: ()
     ```

3. **Non-integer Values:** If the tuples contain non-integer values (like strings or lists), the program will raise a `TypeError` since the bitwise AND operation is not defined for such types.
   - Example:
     ```python
     print(func_1((1, 'a'), (2, 3)))  # Expected: TypeError
     ```

### Conclusion:
From the analysis, we noticed that the program does not handle tuples of differing lengths adequately, which could lead to an incomplete processing of elements (loss of data). It also does not handle non-integer types which would cause errors during execution. 

Correctness: **False**
