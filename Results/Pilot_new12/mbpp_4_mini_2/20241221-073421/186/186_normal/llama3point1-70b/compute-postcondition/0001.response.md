The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the bitwise 'and' of corresponding elements from tuples `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples and return a new tuple that contains the result of the bitwise 'and' operation on each pair of corresponding elements from the input tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters tup1 and tup2, which are tuples, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise 'and' of corresponding elements from tup1 and tup2.**
