#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, which are tuples of integers. It performs a bitwise AND operation on each pair of corresponding elements from the two tuples. The function returns a new tuple containing the results of these operations. If the tuples are of different lengths, only the pairs of elements up to the length of the shorter tuple are processed; the function does not raise an error or handle the potential mismatch in length. So if `tuple1` has more elements than `tuple2`, the extra elements in `tuple1` will be ignored, and if `tuple2` is longer, its extra elements will also be ignored. The final state of the program will be a tuple representing these bitwise AND operations.
