The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Both `tuple1` and `tuple2` are tuples. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple that contains the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples and return a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation performed on the corresponding elements from the input tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, tuple1 and tuple2, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2.**
