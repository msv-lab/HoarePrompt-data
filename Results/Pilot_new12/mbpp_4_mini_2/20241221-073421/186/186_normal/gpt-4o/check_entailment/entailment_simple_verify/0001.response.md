Based on the provided problem description, the function `func_1` is intended to perform an element-wise bitwise AND operation between two tuples. The original assessment identified that the program processes input tuples as expected by using the bitwise AND operation on pairs of elements and returning a new tuple.

However, the assertion checks provided in the original program do not completely match with the actual output from the function, especially in the case of the last assert statement: 

```python
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)
```
The computed output should be:
- 8 & 7 = 0
- 9 & 13 = 9
- 11 & 14 = 10
- 12 & 17 = 12

Thus, the actual result returned by the function for this assertion is `(0, 9, 10, 12)` which indicates that the expected output in the assertion is incorrect. 

While the overall design and function body of `func_1` are correct in achieving a bitwise AND operation, the mismatch between the expected result in the assertions and what actually results from the function means that the function as tested does not meet the expectations laid out in the assertions.

From the annotated code, it is also clear that the operation was executed correctly, but the results required by the assertions were incorrectly presumed.

Considering all the provided information and the contradiction in the expected result from the assertion, the original assessment ultimately concludes that the function is not correct based on its assertions and the expected outcomes.

Final: **False**
