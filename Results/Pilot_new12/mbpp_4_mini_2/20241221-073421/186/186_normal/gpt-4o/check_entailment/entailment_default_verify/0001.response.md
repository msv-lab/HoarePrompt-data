The original assessment concluded that the program is incorrect due to a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output from the function `func_1` for the input case `(8, 9, 11, 12)` and `(7, 13, 14, 17)`. After carefully reviewing the relevant sections of the problem description, the provided program, and the output hints, I agree with the original assessment.

The program's behavior, as described in the output hints, suggests that it performs element-wise bitwise AND operations on two tuples of integers and returns a new tuple with the results. However, the analysis of the assertions reveals that the expected output for the third case `(8, 9, 11, 12)` and `(7, 13, 14, 17)` does not match what the function actually producesâ€”specifically, the output should be `(0, 9, 10, 0)` but the program does not generate that.

Therefore, given that there is indeed an inconsistency with the third assertion in the provided code and the expected results, the program does not meet the overall criteria set out in the problem description. 

Final: **False**
