Based on the problem description, the program is tasked with extracting elementwise results from two given tuples. The provided function `func_1` indeed performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of these tuples and returns the results as a new tuple.

The assertions made in the original assessment correctly validate this functionality, showing that for the provided test cases, the function returns expected results in accordance with the bitwise AND operation.

### Detailed Analysis:
1. The function does operate correctly for the provided test cases:
   - First assertion:
     - Input: `(10, 4, 6, 9)` AND `(5, 2, 3, 3)` results in `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which matches expectation.
   - Second assertion:
     - Input: `(1, 2, 3, 4)` AND `(5, 6, 7, 8)` results in `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which again matches expectation.
   - Third assertion:
     - Input: `(8, 9, 11, 12)` AND `(7, 13, 14, 17)` results in `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, confirming the function behaves correctly.

2. The annotated version provides additional clarity on the function's behavior. It explicitly states that if the tuples have different lengths, the function will simply ignore the extra elements beyond the shorter tuple. This is a notable characteristic that affects the program's correctness in a specific contextâ€”this could be seen as meeting the problem description if we assume valid input.

3. The original assessment acknowledged that there may be edges or ambiguities regarding what "extract elementwise" includes. However, it ultimately supports the interpretation that the function achieves its goal by performing a defined operation (the bitwise AND).

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis and the provided annotations, the program successfully meets the problem description by performing an elementwise operation, specifically the bitwise AND, and returns results accurately for the supplied assertions. While there are notes about the handling of tuple lengths, the behavior aligns with how bitwise operations are typically managed in such contexts within the constraints provided.

Therefore, I maintain the original assessment's correctness.

Final: **True**
