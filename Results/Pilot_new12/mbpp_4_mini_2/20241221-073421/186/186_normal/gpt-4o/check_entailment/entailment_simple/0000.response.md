Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description states that the function must "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." However, the implementation of the function `func_1` is returning the result of a bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of the two tuples, which is not the same as extracting elementwise tuples.

An elementwise extraction of tuples should ideally return the tuples in their original form or as a result that indicates how the elements are aligned or combined rather than applying a bitwise operation. 

For example, if the input tuples are `(10, 4, 6, 9)` and `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, instead of computing a bitwise AND, the expected implementation could simply return a new tuple containing the original elements or a tuple representing some form of combination or comparison that follows the problem directive.

Thus, the function does not do what the problem description explicitly asks for, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
