After analyzing the problem description, the provided program, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the function `func_1` correctly performs elementwise bitwise AND operations on the two input tuples. 

The program passes all the test assertions given:

1. For the first test input `((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3))`, the expected output is indeed `(0, 0, 2, 1)`.
2. For the second input `((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8))`, the output `(1, 2, 3, 0)` is correct.
3. For the third test input `((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17))`, the output `(0, 9, 10, 0)` is valid as well.

The annotations indicate that the function is designed to return a new tuple containing the results of the bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements from the two input tuples. The assumption that the input will always be valid means we do not need to consider how the program behaves with invalid inputs, such as mismatched tuple lengths.

In the original assessment, the concern was raised regarding the broader interpretation of the term "extract" and whether the function was limited only to the bitwise AND operation. However, given that the test cases provided directly align with the expected output of the bitwise AND operation of the tuples, the function meets the requirements of the problem as stated.

Since the annotations corroborate that the function operates correctly as intended and matches the expected output for valid inputs, the original assessment is accurate in stating that the function's behavior aligns with the problem description.

Final: **True**
