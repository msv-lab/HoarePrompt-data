To verify the provided function against the problem description, we will analyze the function `func_1` and determine if it meets the requirement specified in the problem statement.

### Problem description:
The function is supposed to extract elementwise operations from two given tuples.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple((a & b for (a, b) in zip(tuple1, tuple2)))

# Test assertions
assert func_1((10, 4, 6, 9), (5, 2, 3, 3)) == (0, 0, 2, 1)
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4), (5, 6, 7, 8)) == (1, 2, 3, 0)
assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)
```

### Analysis:
- The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tuple1` and `tuple2`, and computes the bitwise AND for corresponding elements of these tuples. The result is a new tuple containing the results of the bitwise operations.

- The function performs as follows:
  - For the first test case `(10, 4, 6, 9)` AND `(5, 2, 3, 3)`, it results in `(0, 0, 2, 1)`, which is correct.
  - For the second test case `(1, 2, 3, 4)` AND `(5, 6, 7, 8)`, it gives `(1, 2, 3, 0)`, which is also correct.
  - The third test case `(8, 9, 11, 12)` AND `(7, 13, 14, 17)` evaluates to `(0, 9, 10, 0)`, which is correct as well.

### Potential Edge Cases:
However, the statement is ambiguous about what exactly is meant by "extract the elementwise". If "extract" implies simply returning the results of an operation like AND, then it is valid. 

But if we consider the meaning could include operations other than bitwise AND, such as summands or comparisons or any other operations done elementwise, then the current implementation is insufficient, as it only returns a result of the AND operation.

Furthermore, the function may not correctly handle:
- Tuple length mismatches (e.g., if one tuple is longer than the other).
- Empty tuples being inputted.

### Conclusion:
Since there are potential cases that the program doesn't handle (like tuple length equality) and may not align with the broader interpretation of "extract," I judge the correctness as False.

Correctness: **False**.
