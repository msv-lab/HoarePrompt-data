To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description, we can break down the task into a few steps. The goal is to analyze whether the function `func_1` correctly processes two input tuples according to the requirements we assume are described in the problem.

Given the assert statements in the code and typical usage of the bitwise AND operation, it seems the goal might be to perform an element-wise bitwise AND between the two tuples.

Let's analyze the function step-by-step:

1. **Understand the Logic**:
   - The function `func_1` uses the `zip` function to pair up elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`, then applies a bitwise AND operation (`&`) to each pair.
   - The final result is a tuple consisting of the results of these bitwise operations.

2. **Check the Provided Assertions**:
   - `(10, 4, 6, 9) & (5, 2, 3, 3)`: 
     - 10 & 5 = 0
     - 4 & 2 = 0
     - 6 & 3 = 2
     - 9 & 3 = 1
     - Result: (0, 0, 2, 1) - This matches.
   
   - `(1, 2, 3, 4) & (5, 6, 7, 8)`:
     - 1 & 5 = 1
     - 2 & 6 = 2
     - 3 & 7 = 3
     - 4 & 8 = 0
     - Result: (1, 2, 3, 0) - This matches.
   
   - `(8, 9, 11, 12) & (7, 13, 14, 17)`:
     - 8 & 7 = 0
     - 9 & 13 = 9
     - 11 & 14 = 10
     - 12 & 17 = 0
     - Result: (0, 9, 10, 0) - This does not match the expected result as per the assert statement, because the expected value was not provided, suggesting a potential mismatch.

3. **Issue with the Output**:
   - The last assertion is incorrect because it states `assert func_1((8, 9, 11, 12), (7, 13, 14, 17)) == (0, 9, 10, 0)` while the actual output from the function would be `(0, 9, 10, 12)`. This indicates an inconsistency between the expected and actual result.

Based on this analysis, we have found a specific case where the output does not match the expected output.

Correctness: **False**
