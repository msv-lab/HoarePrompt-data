The provided annotated program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem states that the function must "extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples." However, the function implemented performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of the two tuples.

To further clarify, here are the details:

1. **Function Behavior**: 
   - The implementation of `func_1` uses the bitwise AND operator (`&`) on pairs of elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
   - This operation is not extracting tuples; instead, it offers a specific mathematical operation (bitwise AND) on integers.

2. **Expected Output**: 
   - The expected function should have been simply producing tuples from the provided tuples in some form (like the elements themselves or the corresponding elements as tuples), rather than performing a bitwise operation.

3. **Misalignment with Problem Description**: 
   - The given assertions test for results of bitwise AND operations, which are unrelated to simply "extracting" elements or tuples as per the original problem description.

Hence, the function does not accurately respond to the task specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
