Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to perform elementwise bitwise AND operations on two tuples of integers. However, it does not handle the case where the tuples are of different lengths properly. While it does compute the bitwise AND for the corresponding elements only up to the length of the shorter tuple, the problem description does not specify how to treat excess elements in either tuple. 

For instance:

1. If `tuple1` has additional elements that are not in `tuple2`, the output may not reflect the intended behavior, as there is no specification for those extra elements.
2. Similarly, if `tuple2` has additional elements that are not in `tuple1`, they will also be ignored, but this is not clearly defined in the problem.

Given the ambiguity and lack of specified behavior for tuples of differing lengths, the program does not meet the requirement in the description for every potential case, leading to its incorrectness. 

An example case that demonstrates the issue:
- Input: `func_1((1, 2, 3), (1, 2))` should yield a tuple `(1, 0)` using only the elements that can be paired, but if there was an expected behavior for how to treat the unpaired elements in a specified manner, the program does not account for that. 

Thus, the program can only be considered incorrect given these conditions.
