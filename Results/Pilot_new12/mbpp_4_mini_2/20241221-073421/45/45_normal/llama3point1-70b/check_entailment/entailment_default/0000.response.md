Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function checks whether a given number is undulating or not by comparing its digits. However, it does not handle cases where there are repeated digits, which should cause the function to return `False`. For instance, if `n = 121`, according to the definition of undulating, this should return `False` since the sequence does not continuously alternate but instead has a repetition. 

Additionally, while the current implementation does correctly identify conditions for undulating sequences, it will incorrectly return `True` for single-digit numbers or sequences where only two digits are present (like `22`), as it does not check for the equal case properly nor does it specifically prevent sequences with repeated adjacent digits from being classified as undulating. The output hints also suggest that if the function receives input like `121`, it will incorrectly return `True`, confirming there's a flaw in the logic of the current implementation. 

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
