To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's first understand the concept of an undulating number. An undulating (or oscillating) sequence alternates between increasing and decreasing. For a number represented by its digits, it should not have two consecutive digits that are either both increasing or both decreasing.

Now, let's analyze the provided program against the problem description:

### Program Analysis:

1. The function `func_1(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input and converts it to a string.
2. It initializes a boolean variable `undulating` to `True`.
3. A loop iterates through each digit in the string representation of the number (except the first and last digits) and checks the relationship between three consecutive digits:
   - It checks if either of these conditions are met:
     - `n[i - 1] < n[i]` and `n[i] < n[i + 1]` (indicating a strictly increasing sequence),
     - `n[i - 1] > n[i]` and `n[i] > n[i + 1]` (indicating a strictly decreasing sequence).
   - If neither condition is satisfied, `undulating` is set to `False`, and the loop breaks.
4. Finally, it returns the value of `undulating`.

### Correctness Check:

The program correctly identifies whether the digits of the number oscillate between increasing and decreasing. 

- The checks performed in the for loop ensure that for any three consecutive digits, they do not all fall into either the category of increasing or decreasing. 
- The program correctly initializes the `undulating` variable and appropriately modifies it based on the checks conducted in the loop.
- Upon completion of the for loop, the program correctly returns the boolean value indicating whether the number is undulating.

### Edge Cases:

- The program does not have to explicitly handle edge cases like numbers with less than three digits since the loop condition ensures that it only processes numbers with more than two digits.

Given that the program checks the conditions described and operates correctly for all expected scenarios according to the problem description, we conclude that it meets all requirements.

Thus, the assessment is:

Correctness: **True**
