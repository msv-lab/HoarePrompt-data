To determine the correctness of the given program:

### Problem description:
The task is to check whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number alternates between higher and lower values (for example, 121, 232, and 1210).

### Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

### Analysis:
1. The program converts the number to a string to iterate through its digits.
2. It checks each digit (except the first and last) to see if it is either greater than or less than both its neighbors.
3. If, at any point, this condition fails, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.

### Potential edge cases to consider:
- The program does not handle single-digit numbers properly as they cannot be undulating.
- It only checks the characters at positions 1 through `len(n) - 2`, meaning if the length of the number string is 2 or fewer, it does not evaluate it correctly.
- A number like `121` will return `True`, which is correct, but a number like `123` should return `False`, but due to the logic it would check pairs sequentially and could potentially miss undulating status at the ends. 

### Testing an example:
- Input: `123` would return `True`, but `123` is not undulating.
- Input: `1210` would also be processed incorrectly since it would evaluate based on its internal neighbor relationship.

Therefore, the code contains logical flaws, particularly in how it evaluates the undulating conditions. Thus:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as outlined in the problem.
