Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 4, and `i` is 2. If the digit at position `i` is either a local maximum or minimum (specifically, if `n[i - 1] < n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] > n[i + 1]`), the condition is satisfied. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
