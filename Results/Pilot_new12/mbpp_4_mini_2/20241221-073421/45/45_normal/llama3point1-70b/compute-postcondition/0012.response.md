The `break` statement abruptly ends the most immediate loop or if statement that is currently being executed. In this case, `i`, `n`, and `undulating` retain their previous values as there are no assignments or modifications to them in the provided code. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged variables and indicates the action taken.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `i` is 2, `undulating` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
