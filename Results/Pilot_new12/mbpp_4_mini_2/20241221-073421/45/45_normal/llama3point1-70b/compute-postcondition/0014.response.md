According to the code, the loop continues based on the index `i` in relation to the length of the string `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `len(n) - 1`, which means it will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(n) - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and since the length of `n` is at least 3, `len(n)` must be at least 3. 

To execute another iteration, `i` must increment to 2. For the loop to run one more time, `i` must be less than `len(n) - 1`, which means the length of `n` must still be greater than or equal to 4 (since `i` must be 2). 

State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 4, `i` is 2**
