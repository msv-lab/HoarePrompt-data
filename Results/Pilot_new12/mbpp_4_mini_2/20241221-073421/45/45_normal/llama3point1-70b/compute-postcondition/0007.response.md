The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 2, and it is not the case that `n[i - 1] < n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] > n[i + 1]`; `i` is 1; `undulating` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
