`n` is converted to a string type, so its value will change from a positive integer to its string representation. The precondition about `n` being a positive integer still holds, but it has now changed type. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a string representation of the positive integer it was previously.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer.**
