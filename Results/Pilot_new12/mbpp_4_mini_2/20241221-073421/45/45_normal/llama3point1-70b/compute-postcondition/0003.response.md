Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer that has a length of at least 2, `i` is 1. The character at index `i-1` (i.e., `n[0]`) is less than the character at index `i` (i.e., `n[1]`) and `n[1]` is less than the character at index `i+1` (i.e., `n[2]`), or the character at index `i-1` is greater than the character at index `i` and `n[1]` is greater than the character at index `i+1`.***
