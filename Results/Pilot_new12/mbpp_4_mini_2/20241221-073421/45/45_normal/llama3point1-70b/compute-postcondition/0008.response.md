Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 2. If the character at index `i-1` is less than the character at index `i`, and `n[i]` is less than the character at index `i+1`, or if `n[i-1]` is greater than `n[i]` and `n[i]` is greater than `n[i+1]`, the program continues executing with these conditions met. Otherwise, `undulating` is set to `False`, indicating that the sequence does not fit the defined undulating conditions, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
