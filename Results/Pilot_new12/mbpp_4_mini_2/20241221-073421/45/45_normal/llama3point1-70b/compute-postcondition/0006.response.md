`undulating` is assigned the value of `False`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n` or `i`, which retain their previous states. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 2, and it is not the case that `n[i - 1] < n[i] < n[i + 1]` or `n[i - 1] > n[i] > n[i + 1]`, meaning `n[i]` is not a local extremum; `i` is 1; `undulating` is `False`.
