Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3. If the character at index `i` is either in an increasing or decreasing sequence with its neighboring characters, the program continues execution. If the character is not in such sequence, then `undulating` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
