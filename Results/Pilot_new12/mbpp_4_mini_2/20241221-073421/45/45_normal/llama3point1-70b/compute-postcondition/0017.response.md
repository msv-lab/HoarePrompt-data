The value of the variables do not change by the `break` statement since it simply exits the most internal loop or if statement in which it resides. Therefore, the Output State includes all the initial states without any updates to the variables. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 4, `i` is 2, `undulating` is False and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
