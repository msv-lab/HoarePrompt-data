The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n`, converts it into a string, and checks if the sequence of its digits forms an undulating pattern. An undulating pattern is defined as digits that continuously alternate in being greater than or less than their immediate neighbors. The function iterates through the digits, returning `True` if the entire sequence is undulating, and `False` otherwise. If the input is a single-digit number or an empty string (which technically isn't passed since `n` is always a positive integer), it would default to `True` since there are no neighboring digits to compare. However, if `n` contains leading zeros, they will be considered when assessing undulation. The function thus accurately evaluates undulating sequences for positive integers with multiple digits, returning the appropriate boolean result based on these checks.
