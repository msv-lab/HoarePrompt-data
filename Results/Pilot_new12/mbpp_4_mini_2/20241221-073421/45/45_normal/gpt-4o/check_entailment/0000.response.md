To evaluate the correctness of the provided code, let's first analyze the problem description and the implementation logic:

The problem requires checking whether a given number is "undulating." An undulating number is defined as one where the digits alternate between two distinct values, starting with a different digit. Based on the implementation of the `func_1` function:

1. The function converts the number to a string and checks if its length is less than 3; if so, it returns `False`, which is correct since undulating numbers should have at least three digits.

2. It retrieves the first and second digits and checks if they are equal. If they are, the function returns `False`, which is correct.

3. For the remaining digits starting from the third position (index 2), it alternates checks:
   - At even indices, it checks if the digit matches the first digit.
   - At odd indices, it checks if the digit matches the second digit.
   
4. If it finds any digit that does not match the expected alternation, it returns `False`. If all checks pass, it returns `True`.

### Potential Case Review
Let's consider some edge cases:

- **Case with less than three digits**: All cases must return `False`.
- **Case with three digits that are not undulating**: For example, `222`, should return `False`.
- **True undulating cases**: `121`, `343`, etc. should return `True`.

Now, evaluating the assertion tests:
- The assertion `func_1(1212121) == True` indicates that this is expected to be undulating and returns `True`, which is correct.
- For `func_1(1991)`, since it has two distinct digits alternating, it returns `False`, which should not be the case if it was truly undulating.
- For `func_1(121)`, it returns `True`, which is correct.

### Errors in the Implementation:
The logic in the function fails to recognize when an undulating number truly alternates. For example:
- The number `1212121` is indeed undulating.
- However, `1991` is incorrectly flagged as `False`.
- The number `212` should return `True`.

Thus, the function fails when the number contains two segments of alternating digits but doesn't enforce them properly in its checks.

### Conclusion
Since the implementation has at least one case where it does not satisfy the problem description, we ascertain:

Correctness: **False**. 

The issue arises specifically in handling the alternating checks and not correctly deducing when a number should be classified as undulating based on the defined criteria.
