To determine the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description and output hints, we analyze the function `func_1`:

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires us to check whether a given number is "undulating," meaning:
1. The number must be a positive integer with at least three digits.
2. The first two digits must be different.
3. The digits should alternate in a pattern where:
   - Even indexed digits are the same as the first digit.
   - Odd indexed digits are the same as the second digit.

### Code Examination
```python
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if len(s) < 3:
        return False
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if first_digit == second_digit:
        return False
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
    return True
```

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints describe the function `func_1` as:
- Returning `False` if the string representation of `n` has fewer than 3 digits.
- Returning `False` if the first two digits are the same.
- Returning `False` if the digits do not alternate correctly.
- Returning `True` only if all conditions are met.

### Edge Cases
1. Input with fewer than 3 digits (e.g., `12`, `1`, `2`): The function correctly returns `False`.
2. Input with the same first two digits (e.g., `121`, `990`): The function correctly returns `False`.
3. Correct inputs with alternating digits (e.g., `121`, `212`): The function returns `True` as intended.

### Cases Where Function Might Fail
One edge case that wasn't covered by the provided examples is the handling of a number with exactly three digits that does not follow the undulating pattern but passes through the preliminary checks. For example:
- Consider the input `123`. It has three different digits but does not alternate (it goes 1, 2, 3). The function would incorrectly return `True`, while it should return `False`.

This indicates that:
- The function will return `True` for `123` (3 digits alternating), instead of returning `False` as required by the problem for non-undulating numbers.

### Conclusion
- The function fails to correctly identify non-undulating three-digit numbers, as demonstrated by the case `123`.

Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
