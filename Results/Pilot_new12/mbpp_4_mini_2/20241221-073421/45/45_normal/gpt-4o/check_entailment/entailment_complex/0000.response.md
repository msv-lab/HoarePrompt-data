Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given positive integer `n` is undulating according to the problem description. 

Here's why the function meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation**: The function checks if the length of the string representation of `n` is less than 3. If it is, the function returns `False`, fulfilling the requirement that undulating numbers must have at least 3 digits.

2. **First Two Digits Check**: The function compares the first two digits of the number. If they are the same, it returns `False`. This is in accordance with the undulating requirement that the first two digits must be different to form a proper alternating pattern.

3. **Alternating Pattern**: The function uses a for-loop to check the alternating pattern:
    - For even indices in the string representation, it checks whether the digit matches the first digit.
    - For odd indices, it checks whether it matches the second digit.
   If any digit does not comply with these rules, it returns `False`.

4. **Return True for Valid Cases**: If the number passes all the checks, the function returns `True`, indicating it is undulating.

The assertions in the code (`assert func_1(1212121) == True`, `assert func_1(1991) == False`, and `assert func_1(121) == True`) demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for these cases. The function captures the essence of undulating numbers, which must alternate distinctly between two digits.

Thus, the function adheres strictly to the problem description provided, covering all necessary cases and correctly implementing the logic specified.
