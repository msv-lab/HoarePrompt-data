You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, as indicated by the return statement.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3.
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False given that the first_digit is equal to the second_digit
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `len(s) >= 3`, `first_digit` is the first character of string `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of string `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`.
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `len(s) >= 3`, `first_digit` is the first character of string `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of string `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is equal to `len(s) - 1`, the characters at even indices are all equal to `first_digit`, and the characters at odd indices are all equal to `second_digit` in string `s`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the given conditions about the string representation of the positive integer n, including its alternating character pattern, have been satisfied.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which must be a positive integer. It returns `False` if the string representation of `n` has fewer than 3 digits, if the first two digits are the same, or if the digits do not alternate as specified (i.e., digits at even indices are the same as the first digit and digits at odd indices are the same as the second digit). The function returns `True` only if the string representation of `n` has at least 3 digits, the first two digits are different, and the remaining digits in the string follow the alternating pattern. Edge cases include handling of the transition from a single-digit or two-digit input to a three-digit input, as well as ensuring that the function behaves appropriately when the alternative character pattern only partially holds.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
