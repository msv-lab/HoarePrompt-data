Final: **True**

Reasoning: The program successfully meets the requirements described in the problem statement. The original assessment accurately verified the correctness of the function `func_1` through various test cases, confirming its behavior for undulating numbers as per the given conditions. The annotated version of the code supports this assessment, emphasizing that the states at different points in the function reinforce the logic that leads to correct identification of undulating numbers. Thus, I maintain the conclusion that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct outputs for the provided inputs.
