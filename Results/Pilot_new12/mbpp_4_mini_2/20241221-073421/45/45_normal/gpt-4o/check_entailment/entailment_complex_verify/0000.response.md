Final: **False** 

The original assessment correctly identifies key issues with the implementation of the `func_1` function, particularly in its handling of the undulating number definition. The assertion tests provided do not fully capture the behavior expected from the function based on the problem description. Specifically, the function fails to recognize valid undulating numbers like `1991`, which should be classified as undulating according to the problem requirements, leading to an inaccurate return of `False`. 

The annotated version of the code supports this conclusion as it confirms that the implementation logic does not properly accommodate cases that should return `True` yet do not align with the established criteria for an undulating number. Thus, the original assessment's conclusion of **False** is validated, as the function does not meet the specifications of the problem description.
