Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the analysis of the function `func_1`. The function indeed checks whether a number is undulating by adhering to the rules defined in the problem description. 

The function correctly:

1. Returns `False` for inputs with fewer than three digits.
2. Checks if the first two digits are different before proceeding.
3. Validates that digits at even indices match the first digit and those at odd indices match the second digit.

The annotated version of the code supports this analysis, confirming that the function behaves correctly under the specified conditions. All test cases provided in the original assessment return the expected results, and the logical flow of the function matches the defined behavior of undulating numbers. Thus, the program is correctly implemented per the problem requirements.
