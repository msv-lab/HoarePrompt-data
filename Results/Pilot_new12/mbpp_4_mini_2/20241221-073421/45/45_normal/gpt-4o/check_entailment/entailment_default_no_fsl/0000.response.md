Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly identify undulating numbers for all potential cases. According to the description, an undulating number must alternate between two different digits, starting from the first digit. However, the assertion `assert func_1(121) == True` is misleading because the correct undulating sequence must have at least three digits and alternating characters. Here, `121` has the digits '1' and '2' but does not maintain a full alternating pattern because it only contains three digits and the last digit is a repetition of the first digit.

A more crucial issue arises with larger lengths. For example, `func_1(212)` would yield `True`, but the input `func_1(121212)` fails the alternating pattern check because it requires a strict alternation which the current logic potentially does not validate correctly.

Since the assertion `assert func_1(121) == True` is not correct as per the mandatory definition of undulating number and shows a fundamental flaw in the pattern identification logic, the program is deemed incorrect for such cases.
