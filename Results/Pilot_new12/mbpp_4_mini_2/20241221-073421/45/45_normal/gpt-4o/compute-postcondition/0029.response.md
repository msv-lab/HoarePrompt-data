Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a single parameter `n`, which must be a positive integer. It returns `False` if the string representation of `n` has fewer than 3 digits, if the first two digits are the same, or if the digits do not alternate as specified (i.e., digits at even indices are the same as the first digit and digits at odd indices are the same as the second digit). The function returns `True` only if the string representation of `n` has at least 3 digits, the first two digits are different, and the remaining digits in the string follow the alternating pattern. Edge cases include handling of the transition from a single-digit or two-digit input to a three-digit input, as well as ensuring that the function behaves appropriately when the alternative character pattern only partially holds.**
