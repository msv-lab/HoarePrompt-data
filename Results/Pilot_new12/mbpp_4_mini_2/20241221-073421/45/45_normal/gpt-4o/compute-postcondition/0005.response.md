The variable `second_digit` is assigned the value of the second character of the string `s`, which is the string representation of the positive integer `n`. Since `s` has a length of at least 3, we can conclude that `second_digit` will hold a valid character from `s` that corresponds to the integer position 1. The states of the other variables remain unaffected: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `len(s) >= 3`, and `first_digit` is still the first character of string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `len(s) >= 3, first_digit is the first character of string `s`, second_digit is the second character of string `s`.**
