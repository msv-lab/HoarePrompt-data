Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n` with a length of at least 4, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. If `i` is even and `s[i]` is not equal to `first_digit`, the function returns False. If `i` is odd or `s[i]` is equal to `first_digit` or `second_digit`, no action is taken.***
