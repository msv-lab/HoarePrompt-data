Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 5, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `i` is 4. If `i` is odd and the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return any value (None).***
