The variable `s` is assigned the value of `str(n)`, which converts the positive integer `n` into its string representation. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`**.
