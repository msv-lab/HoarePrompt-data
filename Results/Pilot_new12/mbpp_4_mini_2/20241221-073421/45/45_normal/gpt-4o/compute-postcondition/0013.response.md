Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `len(s) >= 3`, `first_digit` is the first character of string `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of string `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2, `i` is even, and `s[i]` is equal to `first_digit`. Additionally, `i` is currently 2, so `i % 2` is 0 (not 1), and thus the condition `i % 2 == 1` is false. Therefore, the if condition does not hold.***
