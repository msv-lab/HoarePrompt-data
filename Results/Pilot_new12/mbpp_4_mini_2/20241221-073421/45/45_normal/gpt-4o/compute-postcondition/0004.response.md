The variable `first_digit` is assigned the first character of the string representation of `n`, which is `s[0]`. Since `s` is the string representation of a positive integer `n` with a length of at least 3, the first digit will be the first character of the string `s`. The states of the other variables, `n` and `s`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `len(s) >= 3, first_digit is the first character of string `s`.**
