According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `len(s)`. The `range(2, len(s))` will produce a sequence starting from 2 up to (but not including) `len(s)`. For the loop to execute, `len(s)` must be greater than 2.

Given that the current state indicates `len(s) >= 3`, the loop is set to execute. Additionally, at the start of the loop, we need to consider the variable `i`. Since it starts at 2, we can directly state that.

In summary, the necessary adjusted states for the loop to execute include:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `s` is a string representation of `n`, where `len(s) >= 3`.
- `first_digit` is the first character of string `s`.
- `second_digit` is the second character of string `s`.
- `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`.
- `i` will start at 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `len(s) >= 3`, `first_digit` is the first character of string `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of string `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, `i` is 2**
