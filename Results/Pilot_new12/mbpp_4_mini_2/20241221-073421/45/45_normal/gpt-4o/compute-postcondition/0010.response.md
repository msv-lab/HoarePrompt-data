Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `s` is the string representation of `n`, and `len(s) >= 3`. The first character of `s` is `first_digit`, the second character of `s` is `second_digit`, where `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`. The value of `i` is 2, the current value of `i` is even, and the character at position `i` in string `s` is not equal to `first_digit`.***
