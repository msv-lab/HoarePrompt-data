To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the function:

**Problem description:** Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

**Program:**
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis

1. **Understanding the functionality**: The program uses a list comprehension to create sublists starting from each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` and then takes every `nth` element using slicing (`lst[i::n]`).

2. **Potential issues**: 
   - If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the "splitting" logic might not behave as intended because the slicing might lead to unexpected empty lists being created.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, this will cause an error because the range function will not generate any values.
   - If `lst` is empty, it should return a list of empty lists rather than a list originating from the divisions.

### Finding counterexamples:

1. **When `n` is greater than the length of `lst`**:
   - Example: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` should ideally yield empty lists since there are not enough elements, but instead it will return `[[], [], [], [], []]`.

2. **When `n` is 0 or negative**:
   - Example: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` causes an issue since `range(0)` is empty, which should raise a concern about behavior; ideally, this should return an error or informative message.

3. **When `lst` is empty**:
   - Example: `func_1([], 2)` correctly returns `[[], []]`. However, it can be argued whether this is a proper handling as typically an empty input should ideally not instantiate lists based on whatever divisions.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle cases where `n` is out of reasonable bounds (greater than the list length, 0 or negative). These cases represent situations where the output does not adhere to normal expectations from "splitting" a list.

Correctness: **False**.
