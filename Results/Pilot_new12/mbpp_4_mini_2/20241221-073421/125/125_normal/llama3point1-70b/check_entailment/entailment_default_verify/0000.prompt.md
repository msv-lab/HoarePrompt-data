You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the function:

**Problem description:** Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

**Program:**
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis

1. **Understanding the functionality**: The program uses a list comprehension to create sublists starting from each index `i` from `0` to `n-1` and then takes every `nth` element using slicing (`lst[i::n]`).

2. **Potential issues**: 
   - If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the "splitting" logic might not behave as intended because the slicing might lead to unexpected empty lists being created.
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 0, this will cause an error because the range function will not generate any values.
   - If `lst` is empty, it should return a list of empty lists rather than a list originating from the divisions.

### Finding counterexamples:

1. **When `n` is greater than the length of `lst`**:
   - Example: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` should ideally yield empty lists since there are not enough elements, but instead it will return `[[], [], [], [], []]`.

2. **When `n` is 0 or negative**:
   - Example: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` causes an issue since `range(0)` is empty, which should raise a concern about behavior; ideally, this should return an error or informative message.

3. **When `lst` is empty**:
   - Example: `func_1([], 2)` correctly returns `[[], []]`. However, it can be argued whether this is a proper handling as typically an empty input should ideally not instantiate lists based on whatever divisions.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle cases where `n` is out of reasonable bounds (greater than the list length, 0 or negative). These cases represent situations where the output does not adhere to normal expectations from "splitting" a list.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist consists of elements from `lst` at indices that are `n` steps apart, starting from each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. The function handles cases where `lst` contains fewer elements than `n`, resulting in some sublists that may be empty if there are not enough elements to fill them. The function does not perform any validation on the inputs, such as checking if `lst` is indeed a list or if `n` is a positive integer, which could lead to potential errors if incorrect types are provided. Additionally, if `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the sublists will mostly be empty since there will be no indices to extract from.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
