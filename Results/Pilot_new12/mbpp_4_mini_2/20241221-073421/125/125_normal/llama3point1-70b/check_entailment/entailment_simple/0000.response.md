The provided annotated program aims to split a list into sublists based on the provided integer `n`, which aligns with the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`, and it returns a list of sublists. Each sublist consists of elements from `lst`, positioned `n` indices apart, starting from each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`.

To verify the correctness against the problem description:

1. The function is specifically designed to handle a list input and split it based on every `nth` element.
2. The list comprehension used (`[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]`) effectively creates sublists where:
   - For `i = 0`, it collects elements starting from index 0, then 0 + n, 0 + 2n, and so on.
   - For `i = 1`, it collects elements starting from index 1, then 1 + n, 1 + 2n, etc.
   - This continues for all indices from 0 to `n-1`.

The function correctly returns a list of these sublists, which matches the requirement of splitting the list for every `nth` element.

Therefore, considering the functionality of the program and its accordance with the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

This conclusion is drawn because the program fulfills the criteria laid out in the problem description without any edge cases or inequalities that would render it incorrect under the assumption of valid input.
