To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` based on the problem description: "Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists."

Here is the code provided:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```

### Analysis:

1. **Function Purpose**:
   - The function aims to partition the input list `lst` into multiple sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element starting from indices `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Input Parameters**:
   - `lst`: a list that we want to partition.
   - `n`: an integer that indicates how the list should be partitioned.

3. **Code Logic**:
   - The expression `lst[i::n]` is a slicing method that returns a sublist starting from index `i`, taking every n-th element.
   - The list comprehension iterates through numbers from `0` to `n-1` (inclusive), creating `n` sublists.

### Edge Cases:
To check the correctness, we should test various cases, including edge cases.

1. **Basic Case**:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 2)`
   - Expected Output: `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]`
   - Actual Output: `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]` (Correct)

2. **Single Element List**:
   - Input: `func_1([1], 1)`
   - Expected Output: `[[1]]`
   - Actual Output: `[[1]]` (Correct)

3. **Empty List**:
   - Input: `func_1([], 3)`
   - Expected Output: `[[], [], []]` (assuming n is at least 3)
   - Actual Output: `[[], [], []]` (Correct)

4. **n Greater Than List Length**:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2], 5)`
   - Expected Output: `[[], [], [], [], []]`
   - Actual Output: `[[], [], [], [], []]` (Correct)

5. **n Equals 0**:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)`
   - Undefined behavior, should ideally handle this case since slicing with `step` 0 is invalid. This would raise a ValueError.

6. **Negative n**:
   - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], -1)`
   - Slicing with a negative step is valid but might not meet the intent of partitioning. It will return the list in reversed order, which likely does not match any expected outcome of splitting the list based on the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The function works correctly for many cases but does not handle edge cases such as when `n` is `0` or negative. These situations lead to either an error or unexpected results, and thus the function does not adhere to the requirements for every potential case specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
