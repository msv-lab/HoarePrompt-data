You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements and n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of sublists from 'lst', where each sublist contains elements at indices that are n steps apart, starting from each index i in the range from 0 to n-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`. It returns a list of sublists, where each sublist consists of elements from `lst` at indices that are `n` steps apart, starting from each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. The function handles cases where `lst` contains fewer elements than `n`, resulting in some sublists that may be empty if there are not enough elements to fill them. The function does not perform any validation on the inputs, such as checking if `lst` is indeed a list or if `n` is a positive integer, which could lead to potential errors if incorrect types are provided. Additionally, if `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the sublists will mostly be empty since there will be no indices to extract from.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
