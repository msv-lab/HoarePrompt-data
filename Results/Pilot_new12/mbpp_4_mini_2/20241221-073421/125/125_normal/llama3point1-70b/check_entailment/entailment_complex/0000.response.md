Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly fulfill the problem description. According to the problem statement, the requirement is to split the list for every nth element, which implies creating sublists that begin at the 0th index, the 1st index, and so on, taking every nth element from those starting points. 

However, the code uses a list comprehension that generates sublists in a way that includes every nth element starting from each index `i` in the range from `0` to `n-1`. The results of this approach will vary significantly based on the value of `n` and the length of `lst`. For example, if `lst` has fewer elements than `n`, the resulting lists may not split as expected by taking every nth element from the original list. 

Moreover, if `n` is larger than the length of `lst`, the intended behavior described in the problem (sublists containing elements at intervals of `n`) may not occur correctly, as many sublists will be empty or incorrectly formed.

To illustrate these failure cases more clearly:
- If `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `n = 2`, we would expect to obtain `[[1, 3], [2]]`, which would correctly reflect taking every second element starting from indices 0 and 1. 
- If `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `n = 4`, we would expect an output of `[[1], [], []]`, which does not occur properly under this implementation.

In conclusion, the implemented logic of the program does not correctly accomplish the task of splitting the list every nth element as stated in the problem description; hence it is deemed incorrect.
