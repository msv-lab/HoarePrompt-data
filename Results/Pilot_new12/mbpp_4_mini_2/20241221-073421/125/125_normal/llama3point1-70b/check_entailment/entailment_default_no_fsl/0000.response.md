Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements described in the problem description. The task is to return a list of sublists, each containing elements from the input list `lst` that are `n` steps apart, starting from each index from 0 to `n-1`. However, the implementation fails to account for potential edge cases.

1. The program uses the slicing technique `lst[i::n]`, which means it will create sublists starting from `i` and then take every `n`th element from that point onward. In cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, it will generate mostly empty sublists, which technically is expected behavior based on the output hints but doesn't adhere to the common expectation of splitting into usable sublists.

2. Furthermore, while the output hints mention that it does not perform input validation (which is assumed per your instruction), the lack of handling for unexpected types or empty lists could lead to confusing behavior. However, as per your assumption about valid input, I will adhere to pointing out the incorrect behavior strictly in terms of the output of the program based on the described requirements.

An example where the program does not work correctly is when `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `n = 5`. The expected behavior might be to see sublists like `[[1], [2], [3], [], []]`, but the output will be `[1, 2, 3, [], []]`, missing the expected structure for additional sublists (downgrading the clarity of what the sublists represent).

Hence, since it does not execute as expected in all cases, I conclude that the implementation is incorrect.
