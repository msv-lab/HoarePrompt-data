Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate in highlighting the limitations of the program regarding edge cases such as `n` being `0` or negative. The function does not handle these scenarios appropriately, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior. While the annotations confirm the function works correctly under the assumption that a valid positive integer `n` will always be provided, they do not address the broader requirement of handling all possible values of `n`. The program may work well for the specified input range, but its failure to manage potential improper inputs undermines the correctness claimed in the problem description. Therefore, the program is deemed incorrect as outlined in the original assessment.
