The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. `lst` is a list of elements, and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. The function returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains elements from `lst` at indices that are `n` steps apart, starting from each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of sublists where each sublist is formed from elements of `lst` at intervals of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, returns a list of sublists where each sublist contains elements from `lst` at indices that are n steps apart, starting from each index in the range 0 to n-1.**
