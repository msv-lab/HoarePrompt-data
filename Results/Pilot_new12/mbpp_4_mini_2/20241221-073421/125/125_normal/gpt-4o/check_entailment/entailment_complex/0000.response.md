Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Details**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `n`. The assumption is that `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, and `lst` is a list of elements.

2. **Output Specification**: The requirement is to split the `lst` into `n` sublists where each element is distributed among these `n` lists in a round-robin fashion.

3. **Function Logic**:
   - The function initializes `result` as a list of `n` empty lists.
   - It then iterates over the index and elements of `lst`, using the modulo operation (`i % n`) to determine which of the `n` lists each element should go into.
   - This ensures that the elements are distributed evenly across the `n` lists, adhering to the round-robin assignment as stated in the problem description.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function is correctly structured to handle cases where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, which leads to some of the lists in the `result` being empty.

5. **Tests and Assertions**: The assertions provided with various test cases confirm that `func_1` behaves as expected, yielding the correct output based on the problem description's requirements.

Therefore, since the function consistently follows the problem description's demands and produces the expected results for the tested inputs, the correctness of the program is validated.
