Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly split a list into `n` lists based on the described problem requirements. The function uses a round-robin approach, distributing elements evenly across the resulting lists and ensuring that if `n` exceeds the length of `lst`, the extra lists will be empty. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended, and examples have been provided that support the function's correctness.

I've checked for potential edge cases and valid inputs, and there are no flaws in the logic for the scenarios described. Each element in the input list is appropriately assigned to one of the `n` output lists. Thus, the implementation does adhere to the problem description for all expected cases.

Correctness: **True**.
