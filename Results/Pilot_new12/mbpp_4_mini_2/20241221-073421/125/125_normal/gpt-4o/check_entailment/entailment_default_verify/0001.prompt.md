You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list into `n` sublists, collecting every nth element in each sublist.

Here's how it works:

1. It initializes a result list containing `n` empty sublists.
2. It iterates over the given list with `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the element.
3. For each element, it appends it to the appropriate sublist based on its index using the modulus operator `i % n`. This ensures that the elements are distributed correctly.

The provided assertions ensure that it handles various types of lists (strings, integers) and correctly collects every nth element from the list into the corresponding sublists.

No edge cases or missing logic can be found in the examples checked, such as:
- An empty list would return a list of empty sublists.
- If `n` is greater than the length of the list, the function still returns a list of sublists with the first few elements distributed correctly, while the remaining sublists remain empty.

Since all inputs defined in the assertions pass successfully and the logic is as described, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of elements `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists that contain the elements from `lst` distributed evenly among them. Each element from `lst` is assigned to one of the `n` lists in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that no list within the result is larger than the others. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, some lists in the result will remain empty. The original list `lst` is unchanged by the function's execution. The implementation properly handles the case where `n` is larger than `lst`, leading to an unbalanced result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
