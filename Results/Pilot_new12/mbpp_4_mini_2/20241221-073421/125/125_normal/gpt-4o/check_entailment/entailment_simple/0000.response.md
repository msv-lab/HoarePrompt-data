Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1(lst, n)` is designed to take in a list (`lst`) and an integer (`n`), then split the list into `n` sublists, distributing the elements evenly across these sublists.

2. **Logic**:
   - The program initializes a list `result` containing `n` empty sublists.
   - It then iterates over the input list `lst` using `enumerate`, allowing access to both the index (`i`) and the element (`element`).
   - It appends each element to one of the `n` sublists based on the index of the element modulo `n` (`result[i % n]`). This effectively distributes the elements evenly into the `n` sublists.

3. **Assertions**: The assertions provided after the function definition serve as tests to validate the correctness of the function. Each assertion checks that the outputs match the expected results for different input scenarios. 
   - For example, the first assertion checks when `lst` contains letters and `n` is 3, and the expected result is correctly formed with each sublist containing the intended elements.

4. **Output**: The function returns the `result`, which contains the `n` lists that correspond to the splitting of `lst` as specified in the problem description. 

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: Given the assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list and a positive integer), the program will correctly execute for all valid inputs as described.

In summary, the implementation adheres to the stated requirements of the problem description, correctly splitting the input list into sublists based on the specified integer `n`. Hence, it is correct and fulfills the task as intended.
