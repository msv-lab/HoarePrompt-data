Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program. The function `func_1` behaves as expected according to the problem description, and the annotations confirm this behavior at various stages of execution.

1. **Input Handling**: The annotations specify that `lst` is a list and `n` is a positive integer greater than 0. This aligns with the assumption that valid inputs will be provided.
2. **Function Logic**: The program uses a list comprehension to initialize `result` with `n` empty sublists and uses the modulus operator during iteration to distribute elements correctly into these sublists, as described in the problem statement.
3. **Assertions**: The provided assertions cover various scenarios and correctly expect outputs that reflect the intended functionality of the program.

Overall, there are no discrepancies between the expected output from the problem description and the actual output produced by the function. The annotations bolster this conclusion by illustrating the intermediate states of the program, ensuring that it maintains its intended structure and behavior throughout execution. Thus, the assessment of correctness remains valid.
