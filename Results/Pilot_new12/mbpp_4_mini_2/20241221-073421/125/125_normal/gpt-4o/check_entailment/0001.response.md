Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list and an integer `n`, and splits the list into `n` sublists, collecting every nth element in each sublist.

Here's how it works:

1. It initializes a result list containing `n` empty sublists.
2. It iterates over the given list with `enumerate`, which provides both the index and the element.
3. For each element, it appends it to the appropriate sublist based on its index using the modulus operator `i % n`. This ensures that the elements are distributed correctly.

The provided assertions ensure that it handles various types of lists (strings, integers) and correctly collects every nth element from the list into the corresponding sublists.

No edge cases or missing logic can be found in the examples checked, such as:
- An empty list would return a list of empty sublists.
- If `n` is greater than the length of the list, the function still returns a list of sublists with the first few elements distributed correctly, while the remaining sublists remain empty.

Since all inputs defined in the assertions pass successfully and the logic is as described, the program is correct.
