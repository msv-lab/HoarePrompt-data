Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list and a positive integer `n`, and correctly splits the input list into `n` sublists by distributing the elements in a round-robin fashion. 

The assertions provided in the program serve as test cases and verify that the function behaves as expected for various inputs. The function also properly handles the case where `n` is greater than the length of the list, as indicated in the output hints. In this scenario, some of the resulting sublists will indeed remain empty, which aligns with the expected output.

Therefore, the function correctly implements the logic for the problem description in every potential case described, and no edge cases exist that the function fails to address. Thus, the program is correct as it always returns valid outputs for the described functionality.
