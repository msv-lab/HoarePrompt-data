To determine the correctness of the provided program given the problem description, let's analyze the provided function `func_1`:

## Problem Description:
The function should take a list and an integer `n`, splitting the list for every `nth` element and returning a list of the resulting lists.

## Program Code:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result
```

## Analysis of the Function:
- The function creates a result list with `n` empty sublists.
- It iterates over each element in the input list `lst`, using the index `i` to determine which sublist to append the element to by using the modulo operation (`i % n`).

### Test Cases Provided:
1. `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3)` should return `[['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]`
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3)` should return `[[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]`
3. `func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2)` should return `[['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]`

### Considerations:
- The function seems to correctly distribute elements into the sublists based on the value of `n`.
- However, there is a notable edge case when `n` is greater than the length of the list `lst`. 

### Edge Case:
If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, the program will still create `n` empty sublists, but only some of them may receive elements, which could lead to unexpected behavior. For example:
- If we call `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'], 5)`, the expected behavior based on the problem description is ambiguous because we only have 3 elements, but 5 sublists are created. The current implementation would return `[['a'], ['b'], ['c'], [], []]`, which is not an intuitive result when splitting for every nth element.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and finding an edge case that the function does not handle properly, the implementation does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
