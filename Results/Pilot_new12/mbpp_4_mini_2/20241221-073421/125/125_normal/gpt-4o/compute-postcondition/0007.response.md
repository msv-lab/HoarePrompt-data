The loop distributes the elements of `lst` into `n` sublists within `result`, cycling through the sublists based on the index of each element. If `lst` has `m` elements, the distribution will continue until all elements are processed. 

- If `lst` has at least `m` elements, the first `m` elements will be appended to `result`'s respective sublists such that:
    - `result[0]` contains elements from `lst` at indices 0, n, 2n, etc. 
    - `result[1]` contains elements from `lst` at indices 1, n+1, 2n+1, etc.
    - And this pattern continues for all `n` lists in `result`.

If `lst` is empty, no iterations of the loop will execute, resulting in `result` being unchanged with `n` empty lists.

Output State: **`result` contains `n` lists with all elements from `lst` evenly distributed among them, `lst` is the original list of elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.**
