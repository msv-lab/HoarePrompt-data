According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop executes again for the second element. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `element` is the first element in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 elements, `i` must be 1, and `element` must be the second element in the list.

State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `result` contains n lists, `i` is 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`**
