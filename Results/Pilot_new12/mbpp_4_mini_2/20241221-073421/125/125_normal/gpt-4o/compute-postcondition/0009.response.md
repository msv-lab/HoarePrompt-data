The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of elements, and a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer greater than 0. After executing the function body, it returns 'result', which consists of 'n' lists with all elements from 'lst' evenly distributed among them. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of elements `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return `n` lists containing the elements of `lst` distributed evenly. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of elements lst and a positive integer n, returning n lists with elements from lst evenly distributed among them.**
