The line `result[i % n].append(element)` appends the `element` to the list inside `result` at the index `i % n`. Given that `i` is 0 and `n` is the length of the `result` list (which contains `n` empty lists), the index will be `0 % n`, which equals 0. Therefore, `element` is appended to the first list in `result`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `result` contains n lists, `i` is 0, `element` is the first element in `lst`, and `result[0]` now contains `element`.**
