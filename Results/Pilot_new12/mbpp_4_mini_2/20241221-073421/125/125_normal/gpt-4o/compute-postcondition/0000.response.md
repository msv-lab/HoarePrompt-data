The variable `result` is assigned a list of `n` empty lists. Since `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `result` will be a list containing `n` sublists. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists.**
