The value of `element` is assigned as the second element in the list `lst`, and `i` has the value 1. The value of `n` indicates the number of lists contained in `result`. The expression `i % n` evaluates to 1 if `n` is greater than 1. The code appends `element` to the list at index `i % n` in `result`. The values of `lst`, `result`, and `i` are not changed, but `result` is modified as a new element is appended to one of its lists. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements that must have at least 2 elements, `result` contains n lists with `element` appended to `result[1]`, `i` is 1, `element` is the second element in `lst`**.
