The function accepts a list of elements `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists that contain the elements from `lst` distributed evenly among them. Each element from `lst` is assigned to one of the `n` lists in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that no list within the result is larger than the others. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, some lists in the result will remain empty. The original list `lst` is unchanged by the function's execution. The implementation properly handles the case where `n` is larger than `lst`, leading to an unbalanced result.
