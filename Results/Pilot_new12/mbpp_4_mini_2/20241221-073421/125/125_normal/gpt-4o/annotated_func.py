#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer greater than 0.
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` contains `n` lists with all elements from `lst` evenly distributed among them, `lst` is the original list of elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
    return result
    #The program returns 'result' which contains 'n' lists with all elements from 'lst' evenly distributed among them, where 'lst' is the original list of elements and 'n' is a positive integer greater than 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of elements `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of `n` lists that contain the elements from `lst` distributed evenly among them. Each element from `lst` is assigned to one of the `n` lists in a round-robin fashion, ensuring that no list within the result is larger than the others. If `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, some lists in the result will remain empty. The original list `lst` is unchanged by the function's execution. The implementation properly handles the case where `n` is larger than `lst`, leading to an unbalanced result.
