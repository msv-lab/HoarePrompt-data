Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists (referred to as `sublists`) as input and uses a list comprehension to extract the first element from each sublist. The provided code `return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]` effectively iterates through each sublist and retrieves the first element, compiling these elements into a new list which is then returned.

Given that we assume valid input (a list of non-empty lists), the function will consistently fulfill the requirement of returning the first element from each sublist. Therefore, the implementation aligns with the problem description, validating its correctness.
