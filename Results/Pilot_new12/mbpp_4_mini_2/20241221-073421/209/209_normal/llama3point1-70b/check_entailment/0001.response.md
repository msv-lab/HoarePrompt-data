To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem and the implementation.

**Problem Description:** Write a Python function to get the first element of each sublist.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` in `sublists` and attempts to access the first element of each sublist using `sublist[0]`.
2. However, this implementation assumes that every sublist contains at least one element. If any sublist is empty, this will raise an `IndexError` since there is no element at index 0.

**Potential Case:**
- If the input `sublists` is `[[], [1, 2], [3]]`, the program would attempt to access `sublist[0]` in the first sublist `[]`, leading to an `IndexError`.

Given this potential case, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not handle cases where sublists might be empty, which violates the requirement to "get the first element of each sublist."
