Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle the situation where any of the sublists are empty. As stated in the annotations, accessing `sublist[0]` for an empty sublist will raise an `IndexError`, which is indicative of an incorrect behavior in the context of the problem description that aims to safely obtain the first element from each sublist. Thus, the function fails to meet the requirement reliably when facing empty sublists, leading to its overall classification as incorrect.
