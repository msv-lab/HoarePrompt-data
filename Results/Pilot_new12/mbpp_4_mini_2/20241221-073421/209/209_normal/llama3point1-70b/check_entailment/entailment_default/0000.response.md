The program provided indicates a function `func_1` that returns the first element of each sublist from a list of lists called `sublists`. The output hints indicate that if any sublist is empty, accessing the first element would raise an `IndexError`. This implies that for any empty sublist, the program will fail, which contradicts the intent to retrieve the first element from each sublist safely.

The output hints also mention that the function does not handle the case where `sublists` itself is empty, which, while leading to an empty output without errors, is still a concern based on the problem description's expectation.

Even though the function works correctly if all sublists have at least one element, the function fundamentally fails in the presence of any empty sublist by raising an `IndexError`. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the situation where sublists contain empty lists, leading to an exception on execution, which does not align with the problem description's requirements.
