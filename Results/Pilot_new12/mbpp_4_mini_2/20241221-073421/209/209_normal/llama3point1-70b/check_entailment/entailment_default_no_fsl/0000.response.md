Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, if any sublist is empty, the program will raise an IndexError due to an attempt to access the first element of an empty list. Additionally, if the input 'sublists' itself is empty, it will simply return an empty list without raising an error, which aligns with the allowed input but doesn't adhere to providing clear outputs for edge cases. Therefore, the program fails to handle scenarios of empty sublists, which is a critical edge case based on the requirements.
