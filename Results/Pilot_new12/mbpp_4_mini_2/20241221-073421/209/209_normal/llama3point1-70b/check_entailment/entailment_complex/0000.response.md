Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases. According to the problem, the function should return the first element of each sublist from a list of lists. However, the program will raise an `IndexError` if any sublist is empty, because it attempts to access the first element without checking if the sublist has any elements. This means that in cases where there are empty sublists, the program will not fulfill the requirement, leading to an error instead of the intended output. 

While the program does return the first elements of non-empty sublists, it fails to account for the scenario where at least one of the sublists is empty, violating the expectation of robustness in terms of handling edge cases. Therefore, it does not meet the problem description requirements in every potential case.
