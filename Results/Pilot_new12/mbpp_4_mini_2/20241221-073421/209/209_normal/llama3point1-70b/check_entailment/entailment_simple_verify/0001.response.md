Given the problem description, the program, and the original assessment, let's analyze the situation.

**Problem Description:** Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

**Original Assessment:**
The assessment noted that the program could raise an `IndexError` if any of the sublists were empty, concluding that the program is not correct.

**Annotated Code:**
The annotation states that the program assumes that `sublists` is a list of lists and acknowledges that each sublist can have varying lengths. It explains that the code returns the first element of each sublist.

### Evaluation

1. The program does indeed aim to fulfill the requirement by returning the first element of each sublist.
2. The annotation correctly captures the essence of the function's behavior, indicating that it will access the first element of each sublist.
3. The original assessment correctly states that if any sublist is empty, an `IndexError` will occur, leading to an unrecoverable error during execution.

**Assumptions Clarification:**
The task specifies that the input to the program is valid and will not cause any errors. This means we are to assume that the function will only be called with a valid structure where each sublist indeed has at least one element.

### Conclusion
Taking into account the assumption provided, that the input will be valid, means that we expect only non-empty sublists. Therefore, the function can be considered correct in the context where the validity of input is guaranteed by the user calling the function, even though it lacks error handling for empty sublists.

**Final Assessment:** Since we are considering that the input will always be correct and that the function will return the desired output based on those conditions, the final assessment should be:

Final: **True**
