You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem and the implementation.

**Problem Description:** Write a Python function to get the first element of each sublist.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

**Analysis:**
1. The program uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` in `sublists` and attempts to access the first element of each sublist using `sublist[0]`.
2. However, this implementation assumes that every sublist contains at least one element. If any sublist is empty, this will raise an `IndexError` since there is no element at index 0.

**Potential Case:**
- If the input `sublists` is `[[], [1, 2], [3]]`, the program would attempt to access `sublist[0]` in the first sublist `[]`, leading to an `IndexError`.

Given this potential case, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False** 

The program does not handle cases where sublists might be empty, which violates the requirement to "get the first element of each sublist."

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists named 'sublists' and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. If any sublist is empty, the code will raise an IndexError since it attempts to access the first element without prior checks. Therefore, the final state of the program will be a list of the first elements from each non-empty sublist or an error if any sublist does not contain elements. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where 'sublists' itself is empty, which would also lead to an empty output without errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
