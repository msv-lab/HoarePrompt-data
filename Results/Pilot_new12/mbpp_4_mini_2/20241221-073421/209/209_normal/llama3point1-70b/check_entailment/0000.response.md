Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case when any of the sublists are empty. In such a situation, attempting to access `sublist[0]` for an empty sublist will raise an `IndexError`. For example, given the input `sublists = [[], [1, 2], [3, 4]]`, the program will produce an error instead of returning a list of first elements.
