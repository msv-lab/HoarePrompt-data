Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists named 'sublists' and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. If any sublist is empty, the code will raise an IndexError since it attempts to access the first element without prior checks. Therefore, the final state of the program will be a list of the first elements from each non-empty sublist or an error if any sublist does not contain elements. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where 'sublists' itself is empty, which would also lead to an empty output without errors.**
