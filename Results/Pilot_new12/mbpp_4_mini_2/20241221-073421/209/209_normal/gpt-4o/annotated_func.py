#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists, where each sublist is non-empty.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist from the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of non-empty lists. It returns a new list that contains the first element of each sublist from `lst`. However, there is an implicit assumption that all sublists are non-empty; if any sublist were to be empty, this could raise an IndexError, as the code does not check the sublist's length before accessing the first element. The final state of the program after execution is a list containing the first elements of non-empty sublists, but additional error handling should be incorporated to ensure all sublists are indeed non-empty.
