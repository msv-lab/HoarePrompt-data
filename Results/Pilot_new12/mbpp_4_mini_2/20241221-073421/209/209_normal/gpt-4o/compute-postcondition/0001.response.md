The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of lists, where each sublist is non-empty. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist from the list `lst`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of non-empty lists and return a new list comprising the first elements of each of those sublists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst (a list of non-empty lists) and returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist from lst.**
