To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code.

The program is supposed to return the first element of each sublist in a list of lists. Here are the critical points to consider:

1. **Assumption of non-empty sublists**: The function `func_1(lst)` does not check if any of the sublists are empty. If a sublist is empty, an `IndexError` will occur when attempting to access `sublist[0]`.

2. **Validating the problem description against the implementation**: 
   - The provided test cases assume no sublists are empty:
     - `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]` → `[1, 3, 6]`
     - `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]` → `[1, 4]`
     - `[[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]` → `[9, 1]`
   - However, the function does not handle cases like:
     - `[[], [1, 2]]` → This would raise an error because the first sublist is empty.
     - `[[], []]` → This would also raise an error since both sublists are empty.

Since the function does not account for empty sublists and can cause exceptions in such cases, the implementation does not correctly fulfill the problem description for all potential inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

The presence of an unhandled empty sublist case directly results in an exception, confirming that the program is not correct.
