Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately highlights that the function `func_1` does not account for empty sublists, which can lead to an `IndexError`. The presence of unhandled inputs, such as empty sublists, means that the program does not meet the requirements described in the problem statement. The output hints reinforce this reasoning by confirming that the function assumes all sublists are non-empty. Therefore, no change to the original assessment is warranted, as it correctly identifies the issue with the program's implementation.
