The provided function `func_1` is designed to return the first element of each sublist from a provided list of lists. According to the original assessment, there are a few edge cases that lead to the conclusion of incorrectness. These include the handling of empty sublists, an empty input list, and non-list elements within the input.

Upon reviewing the annotated version, it emphasizes that the function is expected to be called with valid input, wherein the pre-condition asserts that all sublists are non-empty. This assumption is critical in evaluating the correctness of the code.

Given the problem description outlines that the function should retrieve the first element of each sublist and the annotated code clearly states that valid inputs will consist of a list of non-empty lists, the original assessment's conclusion of `False` no longer holds under these assumptions.

By recognizing that the function operates under the stated pre-conditions and assuming that inputs will always conform to these expectations (i.e., being a list of non-empty lists), the function performs as required without raising errors under such conditions.

As such, the assessment should be adjusted to reflect that the conditions provided for testing are indeed sufficient to claim the program's correctness, despite the potential edge cases that would arise under different circumstances.

Final: **True**
