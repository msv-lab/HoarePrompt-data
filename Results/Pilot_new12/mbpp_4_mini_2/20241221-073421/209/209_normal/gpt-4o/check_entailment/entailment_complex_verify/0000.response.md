Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately reflects the program's behavior as it highlights an essential limitation in the implementation: the assumption that all sublists provided are non-empty. The program would fail and raise an `IndexError` if it encounters any empty sublist, which contradicts the robust handling expected based on the problem description. 

Despite the annotations specifying that `lst` is assumed to contain only non-empty sublists, this assumption is not enforced within the function. Thus, under varying circumstances where the input could include empty sublists, the function would not operate correctly. Given that the problem description does not restrict the input to always contain non-empty sublists, the program's implementation is incomplete. 

Therefore, the conclusion of the original assessment stands firm â€” the program does not comprehensively satisfy the requirements of the problem description.
