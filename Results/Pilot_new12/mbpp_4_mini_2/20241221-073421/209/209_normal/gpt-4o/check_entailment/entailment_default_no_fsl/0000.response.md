Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for the possibility of an empty sublist. According to the output hints, the assumption is that all sublists are non-empty, but if there were to be an empty sublist, accessing the first element (`sublist[0]`) would raise an `IndexError`. 

For example, consider the input `func_1([[1, 2], [], [6, 7]])`. This would lead to an error because of the empty sublist. Thus, the program fails for cases where sublists are empty, which means it does not operate correctly for every potential case outlined in the problem description.
