You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists, where each sublist is non-empty.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a new list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist from the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of non-empty lists. It returns a new list that contains the first element of each sublist from `lst`. However, there is an implicit assumption that all sublists are non-empty; if any sublist were to be empty, this could raise an IndexError, as the code does not check the sublist's length before accessing the first element. The final state of the program after execution is a list containing the first elements of non-empty sublists, but additional error handling should be incorporated to ensure all sublists are indeed non-empty.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
