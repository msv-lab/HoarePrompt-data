The original assessment states that the program is incorrect due to its inability to handle empty sublists and non-list elements. However, the annotated version of the program specifies that the input `lst` will be a list of lists where each sublist is non-empty. Given this assumption, we can focus solely on the designated functionality of the program.

In the case presented by the annotations and the problem description:
- The function `func_1` correctly retrieves the first element from each non-empty sublist of the provided list.
- The provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected under valid input conditions that align with the problem description.

Since we are assuming valid input will always be provided, the original assessment's concerns regarding edge cases (such as empty sublists or mixed types) do not apply here as per the assumptions clarified in the task.

Thus, based on the evidence from the annotations indicating the function operates correctly given non-empty sublists and valid inputs, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
