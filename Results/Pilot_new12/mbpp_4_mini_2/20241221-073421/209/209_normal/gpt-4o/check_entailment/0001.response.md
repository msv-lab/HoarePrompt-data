To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we can analyze the function `func_1`.

The problem states that we need to write a function that retrieves the first element of each sublist. The current implementation of `func_1` iterates over each `sublist` in the provided list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each `sublist`.

However, letâ€™s consider some edge cases:

1. **Empty Sublists**: If any of the sublists are empty, attempting to access `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. For example:
   ```python
   func_1([[], [1, 2], [3, 4]])  # This will raise an IndexError.
   ```

2. **Empty Input List**: If the input list itself is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is acceptable, but it should be explicitly defined in the problem description if that's the intended behavior.

3. **Non-sublist Scenarios**: If the input list contains non-list elements, like integers or strings, the current implementation will also fail. For example:
   ```python
   func_1([1, [2, 3], [4, 5]])  # This will raise a TypeError.
   ```

Given these potential edge cases, the current implementation does not sufficiently handle all scenarios as described in the task.

Therefore, since we found cases where the function does not work as expected:

Correctness: **False**
