Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which asks for a Python function that retrieves the first element of each sublist from a given list of lists. 

Here's the breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Structure**: The function `func_1` expects a list of lists (sublists), and the problem states that each sublist is non-empty. The function comprehensively processes the input format as intended.

2. **Logic**: The logic used in the function is a list comprehension that iterates over each `sublist` in `lst`, specifically extracting the first element (`sublist[0]`). This directly aligns with the requirement to get the first element of each sublist. 

3. **Examples**:
   - For the input `[[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]`, the function returns `[1, 3, 6]`, which matches the expected output.
   - For `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]`, it returns `[1, 4]`, also as expected.
   - For `[[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]`, it returns `[9, 1]`, which again is correct.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: As stated, we assume valid input where all sublists are non-empty, so the program does not include checks for empty sublists, and this is acceptable given the problem description.

Overall, the function adheres strictly to the problem requirements and systematically extracts the needed first elements from non-empty sublists, satisfying the problem statement entirely.
