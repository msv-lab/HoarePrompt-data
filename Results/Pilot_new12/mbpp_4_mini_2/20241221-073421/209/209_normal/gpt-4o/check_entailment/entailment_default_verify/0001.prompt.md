You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we can analyze the function `func_1`.

The problem states that we need to write a function that retrieves the first element of each sublist. The current implementation of `func_1` iterates over each `sublist` in the provided list `lst` and returns a new list containing the first element of each `sublist`.

However, letâ€™s consider some edge cases:

1. **Empty Sublists**: If any of the sublists are empty, attempting to access `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError`. For example:
   ```python
   func_1([[], [1, 2], [3, 4]])  # This will raise an IndexError.
   ```

2. **Empty Input List**: If the input list itself is empty, the function will return an empty list, which is acceptable, but it should be explicitly defined in the problem description if that's the intended behavior.

3. **Non-sublist Scenarios**: If the input list contains non-list elements, like integers or strings, the current implementation will also fail. For example:
   ```python
   func_1([1, [2, 3], [4, 5]])  # This will raise a TypeError.
   ```

Given these potential edge cases, the current implementation does not sufficiently handle all scenarios as described in the task.

Therefore, since we found cases where the function does not work as expected:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of non-empty lists. It returns a new list that contains the first element of each sublist from `lst`. However, there is an implicit assumption that all sublists are non-empty; if any sublist were to be empty, this could raise an IndexError, as the code does not check the sublist's length before accessing the first element. The final state of the program after execution is a list containing the first elements of non-empty sublists, but additional error handling should be incorporated to ensure all sublists are indeed non-empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
