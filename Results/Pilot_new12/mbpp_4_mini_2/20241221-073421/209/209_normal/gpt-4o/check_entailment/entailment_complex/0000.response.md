Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description, which is to return the first element of each sublist from a list of lists. 

Here's a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Structure**: The function is designed to accept a parameter `lst`, which is explicitly stated to be a list of non-empty lists. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **List Comprehension**: The function uses a list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in lst]`, which efficiently iterates over each sublist in `lst` and accesses the first element (`sublist[0]`). 

3. **Output Structure**: The resulting list from the list comprehension contains the first elements of each sublist, which matches the expected output defined in the problem description.

Although the function assumes that all sublists are non-empty (which is a reasonable assumption per the problem statement), it operates correctly under the assumption that valid input will always be provided. Given this context and the explicit declaration of the input conditions, the function performs as intended without introducing errors or unexpected behavior based on the described requirements.

Therefore, since it satisfies the requirements set forth in the problem description, the correctness of the program is affirmed.
