The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` does not adequately meet the problem description due to potential errors when given empty sublists or invalid inputs. It specifically noted that these scenarios could lead to `IndexError` and `TypeError`, thereby concluding that the correctness of the program is **False**.

However, the provided output hints clarify that the function is expected to handle cases where the input is guaranteed to be a list of non-empty lists, implicitly disregarding edge cases such as empty sublists or invalid input types. The final behavior, as described, meets the original requirement of the function, which is to return a list of the first elements of non-empty sublists.

Given that we are operating under the assumption that inputs will be valid (as noted in the hints), it allows us to refine our perspective. Since the required functionality is indeed met under specified conditions, the original assessment of **False** seems to be overly cautious given the constraints.

Thus, based on the reassessment and the provided hints that clarify the expectations about input validation, I conclude:

Final: **True**
