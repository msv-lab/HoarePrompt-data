The program, `func_1`, is designed to return the first element of each sublist in a list of non-empty lists. The code utilizes a list comprehension, iterating through each sublist and taking the first element using `sublist[0]`.

The output hints specify that the function assumes all sublists are non-empty. If any sublist is empty, accessing `sublist[0]` would raise an `IndexError`, which means the code does not handle this scenario appropriately.

Given that the function can potentially fail with an empty sublist, it does not meet the problem description's requirements for every potential input case. Thus, we can conclude that the program does not fully adhere to the problem specification.

Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: While the function works properly for the provided examples, it does not account for cases where any of the sublists may be empty, leading to an exception being raised in such cases.
