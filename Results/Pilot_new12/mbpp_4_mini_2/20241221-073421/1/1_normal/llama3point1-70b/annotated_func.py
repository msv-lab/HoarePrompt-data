#State of the program right berfore the function call: test_tup1 and test_tup2 are lists.
def func_1(test_tup1, test_tup2):
    return tuple(set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the common elements in both lists 'test_tup1' and 'test_tup2'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are expected to be lists. It computes and returns a tuple containing the unique common elements found in both lists. If there are no common elements, it will return an empty tuple. The function does not check for the types of the inputs; if the inputs are not lists or contain non-hashable elements, it may raise an error. Additionally, since it converts the lists to sets, the order of elements in the resulting tuple is arbitrary.
