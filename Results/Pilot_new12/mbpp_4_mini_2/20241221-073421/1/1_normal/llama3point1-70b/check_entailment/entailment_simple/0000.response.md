Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should find the "shared elements from the given two lists." However, the program returns a tuple containing the common elements, which is technically a valid feature but does not directly fulfill the requirement that the output must be a list. The specification requires the output to be in the same type as the inputs (lists) rather than a tuple.

Thus, while the underlying logic of finding shared elements is correct in the function (`set(test_tup1) & set(test_tup2)`), the result being returned as a tuple does not adhere to the problem requirement that shared elements should be returned in a list format. 

Therefore, the final evaluation of correctness is **False**.
