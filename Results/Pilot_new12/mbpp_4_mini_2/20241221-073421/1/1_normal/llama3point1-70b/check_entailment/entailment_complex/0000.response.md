Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here’s why it meets the criteria:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and finds the shared elements between them. It does this by converting the lists to sets and using the intersection operator (`&`), which is a valid approach to find common elements.

2. **Return Type**: The function returns a tuple, which is consistent with the problem requirement to identify shared elements. If there are no shared elements, it correctly returns an empty tuple, satisfying the expectations laid out in the problem description.

3. **Handling of Uniqueness**: By converting the lists to sets, the function automatically handles duplicates in the original lists, ensuring that only unique common elements are returned.

4. **Assumption of Valid Input**: The annotations make it clear that the function assumes the inputs will be valid lists. Therefore, it is acceptable that the function doesn’t perform explicit type checking, as stated in the correctness criteria.

In summary, the program adheres strictly to the problem description by correctly identifying and returning the common elements in the specified format (as a tuple). Thus, it is correct.
