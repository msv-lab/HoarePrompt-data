To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` which is designed to find shared elements between two lists.

The function works as follows:
1. It takes two arguments `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are expected to be lists (or tuples) of elements.
2. It converts both lists/tuples to sets, computes the intersection using the `&` operator, and then converts the result back to a tuple before returning it.

Let's examine the requirements based on the problem description and see if the code meets those requirements.

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:
1. **Empty Lists**: If both input lists are empty, the output should also be an empty tuple.
   - Example: `func_1([], [])` should return `()`, and it does.
   
2. **No Common Elements**: If the input lists contain completely distinct elements, the output should be an empty tuple.
   - Example: `func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])` should return `()`, and it does.
   
3. **Lists with Duplicates**: The program converts the lists to sets, so any duplicates in the input lists should not affect the output.
   - Example: `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3], [2, 2, 4])` should return `(2,)`, and it does.

4. **Order of Elements**: The order of elements in the return tuple does not matter, as sets are unordered. The program returns a tuple, which is fine.
   - Example: `func_1([1, 2], [2, 1])` returns `(2,)`, which is valid.

5. **Different Data Types**: The function may not account for mixed data types properly unless it is explicitly stated. 
   - Example: If `func_1([1, 'a'], [1, 2])` is given, it should return `(1,)`, and it does.

Given all of these considerations, the function correctly handles the requirements specified in the problem description. 

### Conclusion:
The function is capable of accurately finding the shared elements from two lists under various scenarios, including edge cases. There seem to be no inputs in the problem statement for which the function fails to meet the expected outcome.

Correctness: **True**
