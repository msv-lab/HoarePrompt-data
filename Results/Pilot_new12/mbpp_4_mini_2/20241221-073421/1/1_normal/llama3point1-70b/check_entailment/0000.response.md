Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly finds and returns the shared elements between the two given lists by converting them into sets and performing an intersection operation. The use of `set` ensures that any duplicates in the input lists are removed, and the intersection operation (`&`) correctly identifies common elements. The final result is returned as a tuple, which meets the requirements stated in the problem description. There are no identified edge cases where the function would fail to meet the description.
