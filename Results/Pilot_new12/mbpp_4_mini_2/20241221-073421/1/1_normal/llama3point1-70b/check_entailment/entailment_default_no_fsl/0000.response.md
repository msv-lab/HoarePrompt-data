Correctness: **False**

The function does not handle cases where the inputs are not lists, or if they contain non-hashable elements. While it's assumed that the user will provide valid input, this assumption could lead to unexpected runtime errors if, for instance, the inputs included mutable types like lists or dictionaries. For example, if `test_tup1` is `[1, 2, [3]]` and `test_tup2` is `[1, 2, 3]`, the code will raise a TypeError due to the presence of a list (non-hashable element) in `test_tup1`. Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirement of handling all potential cases correctly.
