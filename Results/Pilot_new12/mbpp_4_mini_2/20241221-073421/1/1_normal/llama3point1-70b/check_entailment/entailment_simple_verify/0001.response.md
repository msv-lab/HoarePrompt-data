Final: **True**

The original assessment provides a thorough analysis of the function `func_1`, confirming its ability to accurately identify shared elements between two lists as specified in the problem description. The functionâ€™s design, which uses sets to compute the intersection, effectively handles various edge cases, including empty lists, lists without common elements, lists with duplicates, and mixed data types. The annotated version confirms that the inputs are expected to be valid lists, and the output format (a tuple of common elements) aligns with the requirements. There are no discrepancies between the assessment, the annotations, and the problem description. Therefore, the conclusion of correctness remains valid.
