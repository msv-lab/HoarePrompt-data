Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, which are expected to be lists. It computes and returns a tuple containing the unique common elements found in both lists. If there are no common elements, it will return an empty tuple. The function does not check for the types of the inputs; if the inputs are not lists or contain non-hashable elements, it may raise an error. Additionally, since it converts the lists to sets, the order of elements in the resulting tuple is arbitrary.**
