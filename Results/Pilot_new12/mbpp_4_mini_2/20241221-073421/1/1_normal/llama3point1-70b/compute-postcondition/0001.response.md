The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Both `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are lists. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the common elements found in both lists `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two lists and return a tuple of their common elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, test_tup1 and test_tup2, which are lists, and returns a tuple containing the common elements in both lists.**
