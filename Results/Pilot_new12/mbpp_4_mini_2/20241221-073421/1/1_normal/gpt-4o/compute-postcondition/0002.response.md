The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists containing elements that can be of any data type. The function returns a tuple containing the sorted elements that are present in both lists, represented by the set `common_elements`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a tuple of the sorted common elements found in both lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a tuple containing the sorted elements that are present in both lists.**
