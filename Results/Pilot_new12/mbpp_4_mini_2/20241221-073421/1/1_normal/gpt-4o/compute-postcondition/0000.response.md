The variable `common_elements` is assigned the value of the intersection of `list1` and `list2`. This means it will contain only the elements that are present in both lists. The values of `list1` and `list2` are unchanged, but the new variable `common_elements` will hold the result of the intersection operation as a set, which will include only the common elements between the two lists.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists containing elements, `common_elements` is a set of elements present in both `list1` and `list2`.**
