Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the common elements between the two input lists by converting them into sets and finding their intersection. The code then sorts these common elements and returns them as a tuple. The behavior described in the output hints matches the functionality of the code. The assertions provided also confirm that the function produces correct outputs for the specified cases. There are no indications of any edge cases or missing logic in the description or hints that the function does not handle correctly. Therefore, it appears that the function meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
