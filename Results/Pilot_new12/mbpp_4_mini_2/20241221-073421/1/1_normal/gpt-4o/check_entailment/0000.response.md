Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies shared elements from two given lists. It converts both input lists into sets, finds their intersection (shared elements), and returns the result as a sorted tuple. The provided test cases confirm that the function works as intended for the inputs shown, and because it handles the intersection of any two lists accurately, no potential edge cases negate its correctness. Furthermore, it will handle lists of varying lengths, including empty lists, without issues. Hence, the program adheres to the problem description.
