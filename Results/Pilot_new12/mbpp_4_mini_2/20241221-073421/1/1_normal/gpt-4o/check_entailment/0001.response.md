Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists. It converts both lists into sets and uses the intersection operator (`&`) to find common elements. The resulting common elements are converted back into a tuple and sorted, which satisfies the requirement to return shared elements in a specific order (sorted). 

The provided assertions cover several cases, including:
1. Common elements present in both lists.
2. No common elements.
3. Duplicate elements within lists.

The program handles exceptional cases such as empty lists and differing data types (as long as they can be compared), because sets inherently manage these scenarios.

Since I could not think of any input or potential case where the code would not work as expected according to the problem description, the code is deemed correct.
