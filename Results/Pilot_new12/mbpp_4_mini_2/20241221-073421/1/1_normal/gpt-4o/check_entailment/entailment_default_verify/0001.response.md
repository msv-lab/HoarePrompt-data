Final: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement by identifying shared elements between the two input lists. The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` successfully computes the intersection of the input lists using sets, ensuring that all returned items are unique and sorted, which is consistent with the output hints provided. The function also handles the cases where there are no common elements by returning an empty tuple, which aligns with the expected behavior. Thus, all aspects of the problem description and output hints support the correctness of the program.
