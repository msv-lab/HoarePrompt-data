Final: **True**

The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The program meets the problem description by correctly identifying shared elements from the two input lists. The annotations support this correctness by clearly outlining the behavior of the function `func_1`, which converts the lists into sets to find their intersection. Here are the key points that reinforce the originality assessment:

1. The function correctly identifies common elements using set intersection, which ensures that duplicates within the lists are not counted multiple times.
2. The resulting common elements are sorted and returned as a tuple, which aligns with the requirement to have the output in a specific order (sorted).
3. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including cases with common elements and with none, which demonstrate the function's effectiveness comprehensively.
4. The overall functionality adheres to the assumptions that valid inputs will be provided, and edge cases are managed by the nature of sets.

Based on this evidence from the annotated code and the original assessment, the program is deemed correct.
