Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program meets the problem description requirement to find shared elements from two given lists. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the intersection of the two input lists by converting them to sets, ensuring that duplicate values are filtered out. The common elements are then returned as a sorted tuple, which aligns with the specified behavior.

The output hints reinforce the correctness of the program, indicating that it handles elements of any data type, computes the intersection correctly, and returns an empty tuple when there are no common elements, thus functioning as intended. The test cases provided in the assertions validate the function's performance in various scenarios, confirming that it produces correct results consistently.

Since the function operates correctly under the assumptions stated (i.e., valid inputs), the original assessment holds, and therefore, the conclusion about the program's correctness is reaffirmed.
