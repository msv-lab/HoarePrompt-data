Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality specified in the problem description, which is finding the shared elements from two given lists. Hereâ€™s an explanation of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes two arguments (`list1` and `list2`), which are assumed to be valid lists as per the problem description.

2. **Finding Common Elements**: The program converts both lists into sets and computes the intersection using the `&` operator. This effectively identifies the elements that are present in both lists.

3. **Output Format**: The common elements are then sorted and returned as a tuple, which aligns with the requirement to represent the shared elements in a specific format.

4. **Assertions**: The provided assertions test various cases, verifying that the function produces the correct output for different input lists. Each assertion checks whether the returned tuple matches the expected tuple of shared elements.

Thus, the program performs all the necessary steps to fulfill the task of finding and returning the shared elements from two lists as specified in the problem description.
