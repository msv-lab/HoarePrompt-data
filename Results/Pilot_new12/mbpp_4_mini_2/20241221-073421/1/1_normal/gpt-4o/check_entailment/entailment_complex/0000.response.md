Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description by finding shared elements from the two given lists. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both lists containing elements. This fits with the problem definition that requires the function to operate on two lists.

2. **Finding Common Elements**: Within the function, the line `common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)` successfully computes the intersection of the two lists by converting them to sets. This operation identifies all elements that are present in both lists without duplication.

3. **Sorting and Returning**: The function then sorts these common elements and converts them to a tuple using `tuple(sorted(common_elements))`. This meets the requirement to return a tuple of the common elements.

4. **Handling of Duplicates**: The use of sets ensures that only unique common elements are returned. If there are no shared elements, an empty tuple is returned, which is consistent with typical expectations for such functions.

Overall, the function correctly implements the task outlined in the problem description, thus justifying a verdict of correctness.
