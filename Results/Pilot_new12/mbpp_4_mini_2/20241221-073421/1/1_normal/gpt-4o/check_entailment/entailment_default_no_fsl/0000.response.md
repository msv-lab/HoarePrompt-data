Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input and finds the shared elements by computing the intersection. It effectively uses sets to ensure that only unique elements are considered, and returns them in a sorted tuple format.

The provided assertions validate that the function works for the given test cases, demonstrating its correct behavior. The output hints align with the implementation, confirming its ability to handle common cases, including scenarios where there are no shared elements (returning an empty tuple). Since no edge cases or examples contradict the correctness confirmed by the provided hints and assertions, the function can be considered correct for every expected input as per the problem description.
