Final: **True**

The final assessment of the program is that it is correct. The original assessment accurately highlights that the function `func_1` perfectly identifies and returns the shared elements from the two provided lists. The program converts the input lists into sets to find their intersection, then returns the sorted results as a tuple. 

The annotated version also confirms that before the function executes, the elements in `list1` and `list2` are validated to be lists, and the operations being performed (set intersection and sorting) align with the expected behavior described in the problem statement. The assertions provided in the code verify the functionality against specific test cases, all of which align with the expected output.

Therefore, considering both the original assessment and the supporting annotations, the conclusion is reinforced: the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description.
