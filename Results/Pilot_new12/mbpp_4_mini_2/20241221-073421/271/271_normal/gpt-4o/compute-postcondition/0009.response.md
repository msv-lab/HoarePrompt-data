The code `averages.append(avg)` appends the value of `avg` to the list `averages`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Given that `avg` is calculated as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)` and thus is a numerical value based on the second elements of each tuple within `tuples`, the `averages` list will now contain an additional value, which is `avg`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `averages` now contains the previous values plus `avg`, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `averages` now contains the previous values plus `avg`, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is now a list containing the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.**
