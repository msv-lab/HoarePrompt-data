According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `num_elements`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `num_elements`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `num_elements` must be greater than 1. This means that for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` would be incremented to 2. Therefore, `num_elements` must be greater than 2 to allow the loop to run again with the new value of `i`.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` must be greater than 2, `averages` now contains the previous values plus `avg`, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is now a list containing the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
