According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_elements`. For the loop to execute, `num_elements` must be at least 1, indicating that the first tuple in `tuples` contains at least one numerical value. Additionally, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting value in the range. 

State: **`tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
