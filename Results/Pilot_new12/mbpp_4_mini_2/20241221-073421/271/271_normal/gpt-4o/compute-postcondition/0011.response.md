The variable `elements_at_position` is assigned a new value which is a list comprehension that extracts the second element (index `i`, which is 2) from each tuple in `tuples`. The contents of `elements_at_position` will change accordingly to contain only the second elements from the tuples. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` must be greater than 2, `averages` now contains the previous values plus `avg`, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`.**
