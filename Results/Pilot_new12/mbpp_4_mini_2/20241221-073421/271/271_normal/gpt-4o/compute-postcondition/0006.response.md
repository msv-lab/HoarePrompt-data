According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `num_elements`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `num_elements` must be greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, `num_elements` must be greater than 1 for the loop to proceed. 

State: **`tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `averages` is a list containing the appended value of `avg`, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
