The statement `averages.append(avg)` adds the value of `avg` to the list `averages`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the state of `averages` changes to include the new value.

Given that `averages` now contains the previous values plus `avg`, the output state is:

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` must be greater than 2, `averages` now contains the previous values plus the new `avg`, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list of the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` is the average of `elements_at_position`.**
