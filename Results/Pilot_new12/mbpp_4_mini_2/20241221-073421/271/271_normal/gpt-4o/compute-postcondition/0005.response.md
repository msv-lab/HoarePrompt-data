The code `averages.append(avg)` appends the value of `avg` to the `averages` list. Since `avg` is calculated as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)` and `len(tuples)` is greater than 0 (as stated that `num_elements` must be greater than 0), we can say that the value of `avg` will be valid.

The lists and tuple structures are affected as `averages` will now contain an additional element, which is the value of `avg`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `averages` is a list containing the appended value of `avg`, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.**
