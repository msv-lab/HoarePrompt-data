The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values. After executing the function body, it calculates the averages of elements from each position across all tuples in `tuples`, resulting in a list called 'averages'. The number of elements in 'averages' corresponds to the length of the first tuple in `tuples`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of tuples containing numerical values and return a list of averages for each position across all tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tuples, which is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, and returns a list of averages of elements from each position across all tuples.**
