The code initializes an empty list `averages`, but does not modify the values of any existing variables from the initial state. Therefore, the states of the precondition remain intact without any changes to `tuples` or `num_elements`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` is the length of the first tuple in `tuples`, `averages` is an empty list**.
