The statement `elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]` creates a new list by extracting the `i`-th element from each tuple in `tuples`. Given that `i` is initialized as `1`, this means we are taking the second element from each tuple (as indexing starts at 0). The variable `elements_at_position` will now hold these extracted values from the tuples.

Since `num_elements` must be greater than 1, we are guaranteed that `tuples` contains at least two tuples, so `len(tuples)` will also be greater than 1, meaning `elements_at_position` will be a list of values corresponding to the second elements of each tuple.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` must be greater than 1, `averages` is a list containing the appended value of `avg`, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is now a list containing the second elements from each tuple in `tuples`, and `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples).**
