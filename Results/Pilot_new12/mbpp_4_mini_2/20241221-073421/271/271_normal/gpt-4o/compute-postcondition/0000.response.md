The variable `num_elements` is assigned the value of `len(tuples[0])`, which calculates the number of elements in the first tuple of the `tuples` variable. The state of other variables is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` is the length of the first tuple in `tuples`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` is the length of the first tuple in `tuples`.**
