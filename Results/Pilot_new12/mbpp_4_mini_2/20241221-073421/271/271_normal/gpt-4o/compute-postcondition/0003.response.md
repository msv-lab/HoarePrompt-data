The variable `elements_at_position` is assigned a list comprehension that extracts the `i`-th element from each tuple in `tuples`. Here, `i` is 0, so `elements_at_position` will contain the first element from each tuple in `tuples`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple containing tuples of numerical values, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements from each tuple in `tuples`.**
