To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, let's analyze the program and its behavior step by step.

### Problem Description:
The function must take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.

### Annotated Program Analysis:
1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of tuples, as required by the problem description.
  
2. **Length of Elements**: The program calculates the number of elements at each position using `len(tuples[0])`, which is appropriate provided that the input is a non-empty tuple of tuples.

3. **Looping Through Positions**: The function iterates through each position of the tuples using a for loop (`for i in range(num_elements):`), which allows it to access the corresponding elements in each tuple.

4. **Gathering Elements at Current Position**: The program collects elements at the current position `i` from all tuples in a list comprehension: `elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]`. This method effectively gathers the respective elements at position `i` from each tuple.

5. **Calculating the Average**: It correctly calculates the average of these gathered elements by summing them and dividing by the count of tuples: `avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

6. **Storing the Average**: The computed average is appended to the `averages` list: `averages.append(avg)`.

7. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns the list of averages.

### Test Cases:
The assert statements provided check the function against expected outputs. These cases confirm that the function behaves as needed for various input scenarios.

### Conclusion:
The program strictly adheres to the requirements laid out in the problem description:
- It aggregates the elements at corresponding positions from each tuple.
- It calculates the average for those positions correctly.
- It returns the correct format, which is a list of averages.

Considering this breakdown and the fact that all operations are valid given the conditions stated (i.e., valid input will always be provided), we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
