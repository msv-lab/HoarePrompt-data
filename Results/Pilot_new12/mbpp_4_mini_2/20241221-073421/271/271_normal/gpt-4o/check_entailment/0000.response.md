Correctness: **False**.

The program does not account for the case where the input tuple of tuples can be empty. If `tuples` is empty, trying to access `tuples[0]` will throw an `IndexError`, thus failing to properly handle this edge case. This oversight means that the program doesn't meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
