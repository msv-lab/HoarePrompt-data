To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze what the program does.

### Problem Description
The function should take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. It should compute the average for the values at each position across all tuples.

### Program Examination
Here's the breakdown of the function `func_1`:

1. **Initialization**: The number of elements in the tuples is determined by `num_elements = len(tuples[0])`. This assumes that all inner tuples have the same number of elements.
   
2. **Averaging Logic**: It then iterates over each index (from 0 to `num_elements - 1`):
   - It constructs a list `elements_at_position` which contains the elements at the current index `i` from all tuples.
   - It computes the average of that list and appends it to the result list `averages`.

3. **Return Value**: Finally, it returns the `averages` list.

### Testing for Edge Cases
1. **Variable Length Tuples**: The program assumes all inner tuples are of equal length. If we provide an input like `((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`, this will lead to an `IndexError` when it tries to access an index that doesn't exist in the shorter tuple.
   
2. **Empty Input**: The program does not handle the case of an empty tuple or a tuple containing empty tuples. For instance, an input like `()`, or `((1, 2),)` would lead to an error if accessed improperly.

3. **Negative or Non-numeric values**: While the program technically will handle positive, negative, and non-integer values (due to Python's handling of floats), it is important to ascertain whether the program should handle only numeric inputs.

### Conclusion
Since the function does not handle the edge case of tuples with different lengths and does not handle empty input correctly, we can conclude that it does not meet the requirements for all potential inputs as described in the problem.

Therefore, the correctness evaluation is:

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails when the tuples provided are of different lengths, for example:
```python
func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))  # This will raise an IndexError
```
