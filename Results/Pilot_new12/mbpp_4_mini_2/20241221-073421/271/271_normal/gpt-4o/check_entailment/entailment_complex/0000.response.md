Correctness: **True** 

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Structure**: The function `func_1` is designed to accept a tuple of tuples, which matches the input structure specified in the problem description.

2. **Calculating Averages**: The logic inside the function correctly calculates the average of the values at each index across the provided tuples. It accomplishes this by:
   - Iterating through the indices of the inner tuples.
   - Collecting the values from each tuple at the current index into a list (`elements_at_position`).
   - Calculating the average by summing these values and dividing by the total number of tuples.

3. **Returning the Average List**: The function returns a list of averages, which is precisely what is required according to the problem statement.

4. **Correctness of Code**: The assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves as intended for multiple test cases. Each assertion verifies that the output matches the expected average list derived from the input tuples.

5. **Assuming Valid Input**: As stated, the program assumes that the input will always be valid. It does not need to handle cases where the input might lead to errors, as this is outside the scope defined in the problem description.

Overall, the implementation fulfills the requirements laid out, providing the correct averages in the specified format, hence the function is considered correct.
