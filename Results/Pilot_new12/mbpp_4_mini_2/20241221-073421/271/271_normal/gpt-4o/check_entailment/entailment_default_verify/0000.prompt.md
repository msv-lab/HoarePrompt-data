You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
assert func_1(((10, 10, 10, 12), (30, 45, 56, 45), (81, 80, 39, 32), (1, 2, 3, 4))) == [30.5, 34.25, 27.0, 23.25]
assert func_1(((1, 1, -5), (30, -15, 56), (81, -60, -39), (-10, 2, 3))) == [25.5, -18.0, 3.75]
assert func_1(((100, 100, 100, 120), (300, 450, 560, 450), (810, 800, 390, 320), (10, 20, 30, 40))) == [305.0, 342.5, 270.0, 232.5]

def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        averages.append(avg)
    return averages


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not account for the case where the input tuple of tuples can be empty. If `tuples` is empty, trying to access `tuples[0]` will throw an `IndexError`, thus failing to properly handle this edge case. This oversight means that the program doesn't meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple containing tuples of numerical values. It calculates the average of values at each index across all the inner tuples and returns a list of these averages. Each index's average is computed by summing the corresponding values from all tuples and dividing by the number of tuples. However, the function does not contain error handling for edge cases such as when `tuples` is empty or when inner tuples have different lengths, which could lead to an IndexError or misleading averages. In its final state, the program returns a list `averages` that holds the average values for each position across the tuples provided.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
