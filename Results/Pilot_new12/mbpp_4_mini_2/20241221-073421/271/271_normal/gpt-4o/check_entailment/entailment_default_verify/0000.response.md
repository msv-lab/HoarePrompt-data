The provided program `func_1` is designed to compute the average of corresponding values from a tuple of tuples. While the implementation appears to work for the given examples, the original assessment correctly identified a critical issue: the lack of error handling for empty input. When the input tuple is empty, attempting to access `tuples[0]` results in an `IndexError`, which demonstrates that the program does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases, as it should handle and gracefully respond to empty input.

Additionally, the output hints clarify that the function does not account for cases where inner tuples may have different lengths, which could also lead to erroneous behavior. These limitations further validate the original assessment that the program is not entirely correct.

Thus, I have to maintain the original assessment due to these identified shortcomings.

Final: **False**
