Based on the problem description, the function `func_1` is supposed to take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. The annotations provided confirm that the function constructs a list of averages correctly when it is given valid inputs.

Analyzing the annotations:

1. The statements preceding the function call indicate that the input is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values, which aligns with the expected input format as described in the problem.
2. The function calculates the averages at each position correctly by summing the respective values from all tuples and dividing by the number of tuples, which also aligns with the problem description.
3. The final state of the program shows that the function successfully returns a list of averages, confirming that it operates as intended given valid input.

The original assessment, however, noted that the function does not handle cases where the inner tuples may have different lengths or if the input is empty. It asserted this was a case for concern. While it's true that the function currently lacks error handling for these cases, the re-evaluation indicates that the correctness of the function when given valid input is maintained. 

Considering that the problem description assumes valid input, and the program operates correctly on such input, the original assessment that claimed the function as incorrect seems to be too harsh and does not accurately reflect the function's behavior under assumed conditions.

Thus, I revise the final assessment as follows:

Final: **True**
