Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle edge cases properly, such as when the input `tuples` is empty or when the inner tuples have different lengths. For instance, if we provide an empty input like `(func_1(()))`, it would lead to an IndexError when trying to access `tuples[0]`. Also, if the tuples have different lengths (e.g., `func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))`), it will throw an IndexError because the code assumes that all inner tuples have the same length. 

Since the program potentially fails for these cases, it does not meet the problem description for every potential case, thus making it incorrect.
