The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a tuple containing tuples of numerical values. It calculates the average of values at each index across all the inner tuples and returns a list of these averages. Each index's average is computed by summing the corresponding values from all tuples and dividing by the number of tuples. However, the function does not contain error handling for edge cases such as when `tuples` is empty or when inner tuples have different lengths, which could lead to an IndexError or misleading averages. In its final state, the program returns a list `averages` that holds the average values for each position across the tuples provided.
