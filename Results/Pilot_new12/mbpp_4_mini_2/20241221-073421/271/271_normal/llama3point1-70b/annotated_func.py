#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numerical values.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages for each position of numerical values in the inner tuples of 'tuples'. Each average is calculated as the sum of the corresponding values divided by the number of inner tuples.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values. It returns a list of averages computed for each position of the numerical values contained within the inner tuples. Each average is calculated by summing the corresponding values from all the inner tuples and dividing by the total number of inner tuples. If `tuples` is empty, the function will result in a division by zero error because the code does not handle this edge case. As such, the function's intended operation assumes that at least one inner tuple is present in the input.
