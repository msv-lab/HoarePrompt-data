Functionality: ** The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values. It returns a list of averages computed for each position of the numerical values contained within the inner tuples. Each average is calculated by summing the corresponding values from all the inner tuples and dividing by the total number of inner tuples. If `tuples` is empty, the function will result in a division by zero error because the code does not handle this edge case. As such, the function's intended operation assumes that at least one inner tuple is present in the input. **
