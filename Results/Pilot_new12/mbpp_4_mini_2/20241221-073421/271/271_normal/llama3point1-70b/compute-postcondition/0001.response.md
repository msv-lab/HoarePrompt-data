The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numerical values. After executing the function body, it calculates the average for each position of numerical values in the inner tuples of `tuples`. Each average is computed by summing the corresponding values from all inner tuples and dividing by the number of inner tuples. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of tuples containing numerical values and return a list of averages for each position in the inner tuples. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tuples, which is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values, and returns a list of averages for each position of the numerical values in the inner tuples.**
