Based on the provided problem description, the function `func_1` is intended to compute the average of values from a tuple of tuples. The original assessment states that the program is incorrect due to the possibility of a `ZeroDivisionError` when the input is an empty tuple. 

The annotated version of the code also maintains that the program aims to return a list of averages. While it correctly explains that the program computes the averages for valid input, it does not explicitly address empty input cases. 

Given the assumption that the input to the program will be valid (as per the task instructions), we interpret "valid" input in this context as meaning that the input will not be empty. Hence, despite the original assessment pointing out potential failure for empty input, the overall behavior of the function for the expected valid inputs aligns with the problem description.

Thus, I find that the original assessment does not hold true under the assumption of valid input:

Final: **True**
