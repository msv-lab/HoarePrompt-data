Correctness: **True**

The program implements the problem description as required. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple of tuples as input. The program uses the `zip(*tuples)` function to transpose the tuples, effectively grouping values by their corresponding positions across all the inner tuples.

In the list comprehension, it calculates the average for each group of values by summing them (`sum(val)`) and dividing by the number of inner tuples (`len(tuples)`). This correctly computes the average of the corresponding values at each position across the tuples as specified in the problem description.

The structure of the input is assumed to be valid (a tuple of tuples with numerical values), and the program correctly follows through with the required calculations without any errors or edge cases that would affect its correctness given the specified assumptions. Thus, it meets all the requirements of the problem description.
