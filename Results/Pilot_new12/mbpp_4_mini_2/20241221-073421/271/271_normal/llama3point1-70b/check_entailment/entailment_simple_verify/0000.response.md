Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies the program's limitation regarding edge cases, specifically the lack of error handling for empty inputs and tuples of varying lengths. Although the annotations affirm that the function behaves correctly under the assumption of valid input, they fail to negate the fact that the program will raise exceptions under specific conditions, which means that it does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios. Thus, the final correctness of the program remains **False**.
