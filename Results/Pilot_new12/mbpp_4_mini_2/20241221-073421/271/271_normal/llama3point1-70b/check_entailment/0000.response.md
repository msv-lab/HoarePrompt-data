To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and see if it fulfills the requirements.

### Problem Description:
The function is supposed to take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. Specifically, for each position, it needs to compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.

### Program Code:
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

### Analysis:
1. **Functionality of zip(*tuples)**: This will correctly group elements from the tuples in the input. If `tuples` is `((1, 2), (3, 4))`, `zip(*tuples)` would produce `[(1, 3), (2, 4)]`.

2. **Averaging Logic**: For each group of values returned by `zip`, the code evaluates `sum(val) / len(tuples)`. This operation correctly calculates the average for that group. For the previously mentioned example, the averages would be `(1+3)/2 = 2.0` and `(2+4)/2 = 3.0`, resulting in `[2.0, 3.0]`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - **Empty Tuple**: If the input tuple of tuples is empty `()`, this will lead to a division by zero error (`len(tuples)` will be `0`).
   - **Single Tuple**: If there is only one tuple like `((1, 2, 3),)`, the averages ought to be `[1.0, 2.0, 3.0]`, which it correctly calculates.
   - **Variable Length Tuples**: If the tuples within the input have different lengths, it will also raise a `ValueError` upon trying to average them, since `zip` will only aggregate up to the length of the shortest tuple.

### Conclusion:
While the program correctly computes averages given a valid input structure, it lacks error handling for the edge cases mentioned (empty tuple and uneven tuple lengths). Hence, in these conditions, it would raise exceptions instead of giving a meaningful output.

Therefore:

Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for every potential case, specifically when it encounters empty input or tuples of varying lengths.
