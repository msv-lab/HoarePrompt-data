You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. For each position, compute the average of values from all tuples at that position.
Program:
```
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input tuple is empty. If `tuples` is an empty tuple, `len(tuples)` will be 0, and attempting to compute `sum(val) / len(tuples)` would result in a `ZeroDivisionError`. Therefore, the function will fail for this case:

```python
func_1(())  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
```

Since the program does not account for the possibility of an empty input, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, where each inner tuple contains numerical values.
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
    #The program returns a list of averages for each position of numerical values in the inner tuples of 'tuples'. Each average is calculated as the sum of the corresponding values divided by the number of inner tuples.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values. It returns a list of averages computed for each position of the numerical values contained within the inner tuples. Each average is calculated by summing the corresponding values from all the inner tuples and dividing by the total number of inner tuples. If `tuples` is empty, the function will result in a division by zero error because the code does not handle this edge case. As such, the function's intended operation assumes that at least one inner tuple is present in the input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
