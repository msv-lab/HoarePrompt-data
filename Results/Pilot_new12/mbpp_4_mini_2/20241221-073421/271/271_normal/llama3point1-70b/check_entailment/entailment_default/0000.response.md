The provided Python program attempts to compute the average of corresponding values from a tuple of tuples. 

Program:
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values. It returns a list of averages computed for each position of the numerical values contained within the inner tuples. Each average is calculated by summing the corresponding values from all the inner tuples and dividing by the total number of inner tuples. If `tuples` is empty, the function will result in a division by zero error because the code does not handle this edge case. As such, the function's intended operation assumes that at least one inner tuple is present in the input.

**Analysis**: 
- The code uses `zip(*tuples)` to group corresponding elements from the inner tuples, which is a correct approach for this type of problem.
- It computes averages using list comprehension: `[sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]`.
- However, if `tuples` is empty, `len(tuples)` will be 0, leading to a division by zero error, which is not handled in the code.

The requirement from the problem description is that the function should work for every potential case. Since the function fails when provided with an empty tuple of tuples, it does not meet this requirement. 

Correctness: **False**.
