Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input `tuples` is empty. As stated in the output hints, if `tuples` is empty, the code attempts to calculate the average, which results in a division by zero error. This failure to account for an empty input means that the function does not meet the requirements for all potential cases, specifically when no inner tuples are provided.
