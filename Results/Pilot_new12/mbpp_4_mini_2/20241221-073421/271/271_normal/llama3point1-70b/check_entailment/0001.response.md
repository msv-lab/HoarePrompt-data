Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input tuple is empty. If `tuples` is an empty tuple, `len(tuples)` will be 0, and attempting to compute `sum(val) / len(tuples)` would result in a `ZeroDivisionError`. Therefore, the function will fail for this case:

```python
func_1(())  # This will raise a ZeroDivisionError
```

Since the program does not account for the possibility of an empty input, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
