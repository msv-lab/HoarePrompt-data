#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `lst`. If `i` is odd, `lst[i-1]` must be odd or `lst[i]` must be odd; otherwise, the function would return False. If `i` is even, there are no specific conditions to satisfy post-loop execution.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the conditions for the length of the list 'lst' have been satisfied, as 'i' is even and therefore does not impose any specific conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It checks each element in `lst` based on their index. If the index is odd and the corresponding element in `lst` is even, the function returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any such condition that triggers a `False` return, it returns `True`. Thus, the function ensures that all elements at odd indices in the list are not even. The final state of the program indicates whether the list meets this condition.
