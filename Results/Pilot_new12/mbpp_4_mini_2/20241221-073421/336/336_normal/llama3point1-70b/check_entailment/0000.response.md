Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1(lst)` is supposed to check that every element at an odd index in the list contains an odd number. However, there are a couple of issues:

1. The loop iterates over the entire list, which means it checks even indices in addition to odd indices, but the logic is only valid for odd indices.
2. The program fails to handle cases where the list may have odd numbers at even indices or where the list has fewer than two elements.

For example, consider the input `lst = [1, 2, 3]`. Here:
- Index `1` (which is odd) contains the value `2`, which is even. The function will correctly return `False`.

Now consider `lst = [2, 4]`. For this case:
- Index `1` (which is odd) contains the value `4`, which is also even. The function will return `False`, which is correct.

However, for an empty list `lst = []`, the function will return `True`, but since there are no odd indices to check, the function does not correctly validate the problem description that every odd index should contain odd numbers.

In summary, the function does not handle all edge cases properly, thus making it incorrect.
