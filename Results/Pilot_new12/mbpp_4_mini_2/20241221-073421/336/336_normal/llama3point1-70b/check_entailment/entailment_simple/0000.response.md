Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly implement the requirement specified in the problem description. The problem description states that "every odd index contains odd numbers," meaning that for an index `i` that is odd, the value at that index `lst[i]` must be an odd number.

Let's analyze the code:

1. The loop iterates through all the indices of the list `lst`.
2. It checks if the index `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`).
3. If `i` is odd, it checks if the value at that index (`lst[i]`) is even (i.e., `lst[i] % 2 == 0`). If it is even, the function returns `False`.
4. If `i` is even, it does nothing.

The issue here is that the function does not explicitly check if odd indexed values (not just the even ones) are odd, because it only considers returning `False` when an odd index holds an even number. However, it does not verify whether all odd indices indeed contain odd numbers. 

Moreover, there is no explicit check for the positions themselves. For example, if the list were `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the function would correctly return `False` since index 1 holds the number 2 (even), but it could also return `True` for other combinations of odd and even indexed values.

To satisfy the problem requirements, the logic to confirm that every odd index indeed contains odd numbers is not fully implemented, which is evident in this code snippet. Therefore, the function can return `True` when the odd indices might not contain odd numbers, thereby failing to meet the requirement.

In conclusion, because the program does not comprehensively check all odd indexed values to ensure they are odd, it does not fully adhere to the problem description's requirements.
