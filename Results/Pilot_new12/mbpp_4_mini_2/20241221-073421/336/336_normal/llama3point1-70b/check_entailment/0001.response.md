To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to consider the problem description: the program should check whether every odd index in the list contains odd numbers.

Let's analyze the provided function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis:

1. The function iterates through all indices of the list using a range based on the length of the list.
2. For each index, it checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and if the corresponding value in the list at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
3. If it finds an odd index with an even number, it returns `False`.
4. If it completes the loop without returning `False`, it returns `True`.

However, let's consider edge cases:

- **Case with an empty list**: 
  - Input: `[]` 
  - Expected Output: `True` (there are no odd indices to check).
  - Actual Output: `True` (the function would return True correctly since the loop doesn't execute).

- **Case with a single element**:
  - Input: `[1]` 
  - Expected Output: `True` (the only index is 0, which is not odd).
  - Actual Output: `True` (as the loop doesn't check any odd indices).

- **Case with two elements**:
  - Input: `[1, 2]` 
  - Expected Output: `False` (index 1 is odd and the number at that index is even).
  - Actual Output: `False` (correct).

- **Case with an odd-indexed even number**:
  - Input: `[3, 4, 5]` 
  - Expected Output: `False` (index 1 is odd and has an even number).
  - Actual Output: `False` (correct).

- **Case with all odd numbers**:
  - Input: `[1, 3, 5, 7]` 
  - Expected Output: `True` (all odd numbers, odd indices are fine).
  - Actual Output: `True` (correct).

- **Case with mixed even and odd on odd indices**:
  - Input: `[2, 3, 4, 5]` 
  - Expected Output: `False` (index 1 has odd number).
  - Actual Output: `False` (this one is incorrectly handled since it incorrectly counts the odd number on the odd index).

### Conclusion:
The function fails on the key aspect of the problem statement: it is only checking for even numbers at odd indices, and does not define the behavior for odd numbers at those indices. Since the function returns True for odd numbers at odd indices but the problem doesn't specify that those are acceptable, it fails the requirement of being strictly in accordance with the description.

Thus, based on our exploration of input cases, we find:
Correctness: **False**
