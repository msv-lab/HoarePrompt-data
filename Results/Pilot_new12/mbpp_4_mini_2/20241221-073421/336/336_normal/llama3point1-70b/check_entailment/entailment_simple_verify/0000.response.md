The original assessment states that the function `func_1(lst)` is incorrect, and after evaluating the annotated version of the program along with the problem description, I agree with the original assessment.

1. The function is designed to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers. However, the logic within the function checks all indices but only applies its condition to odd indices (`i % 2 != 0`). This means that it unnecessarily iterates over even indices, which does not contribute to solving the problem.

2. The statement in the annotations about the state of the program after the loop execution is misleading. While it correctly articulates that if `i` is odd, `lst[i-1]` must be odd for a valid case (as `lst[i]` is not present in the valid range), it fails to consider that for an empty list or a list with only even indices, the function would still return `True`. This does not align with the problem's description that emphasizes the need for odd numbers at each odd index.

3. The function might return `True` incorrectly in cases like an empty list or a list where all odd indices are not holding odd values. For example, for the inputs `lst = []` or `lst = [2, 4]`, it will not properly validate the conditions since there are no odd indexed elements to check.

Thus, the iterating logic could lead to misleading conclusions about whether the original conditions were satisfied.

Given this thorough evaluation, considering both the annotations and the issues with how odd indices are being evaluated, I conclude that the original assessment holds true.

Final: **False**
