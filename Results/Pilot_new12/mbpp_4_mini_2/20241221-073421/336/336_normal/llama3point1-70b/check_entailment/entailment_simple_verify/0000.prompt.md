You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1(lst)` is supposed to check that every element at an odd index in the list contains an odd number. However, there are a couple of issues:

1. The loop iterates over the entire list, which means it checks even indices in addition to odd indices, but the logic is only valid for odd indices.
2. The program fails to handle cases where the list may have odd numbers at even indices or where the list has fewer than two elements.

For example, consider the input `lst = [1, 2, 3]`. Here:
- Index `1` (which is odd) contains the value `2`, which is even. The function will correctly return `False`.

Now consider `lst = [2, 4]`. For this case:
- Index `1` (which is odd) contains the value `4`, which is also even. The function will return `False`, which is correct.

However, for an empty list `lst = []`, the function will return `True`, but since there are no odd indices to check, the function does not correctly validate the problem description that every odd index should contain odd numbers.

In summary, the function does not handle all edge cases properly, thus making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `lst`. If `i` is odd, `lst[i-1]` must be odd or `lst[i]` must be odd; otherwise, the function would return False. If `i` is even, there are no specific conditions to satisfy post-loop execution.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the conditions for the length of the list 'lst' have been satisfied, as 'i' is even and therefore does not impose any specific conditions.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
