The original assessment states that the correctness of the program `func_1(lst)` is **False**. This makes sense based on the problem description, which requires the program to check whether every odd index contains an odd number. 

The output hints further elaborate that the function checks each element in the list based on the index, returning `False` when an odd indexed element is even. This aspect aligns with what is described in the problem statement. However, they also imply that the function's behavior for specific edge cases and the handling of all odd indices might not be correctly implemented. 

The original assessment provides multiple valid points:

1. **Iterating over all indices**: The loop checks all indices rather than focusing solely on odd indices. However, the logic only applies to odd indices, which is a crucial part of the specification.

2. **Behavior on empty lists**: Although the specification doesn't explicitly state how to handle empty lists, the assessment argues that the function should still determine a condition for odd indices. 

3. **Handling edge cases**: The failure to explicitly state conditions around odd versus even indexed values could lead to incorrect conclusions based on the context provided.

Considering the output hints do nothing to clarify or rectify these flaws and primarily summarize what the function does without correcting or addressing its logical issues, the original assessment remains accurate. Therefore, the conclusion is that the program does not meet the problem description as required.

Final: **False**
