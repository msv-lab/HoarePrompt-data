You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1(lst)` is supposed to check that every element at an odd index in the list contains an odd number. However, there are a couple of issues:

1. The loop iterates over the entire list, which means it checks even indices in addition to odd indices, but the logic is only valid for odd indices.
2. The program fails to handle cases where the list may have odd numbers at even indices or where the list has fewer than two elements.

For example, consider the input `lst = [1, 2, 3]`. Here:
- Index `1` (which is odd) contains the value `2`, which is even. The function will correctly return `False`.

Now consider `lst = [2, 4]`. For this case:
- Index `1` (which is odd) contains the value `4`, which is also even. The function will return `False`, which is correct.

However, for an empty list `lst = []`, the function will return `True`, but since there are no odd indices to check, the function does not correctly validate the problem description that every odd index should contain odd numbers.

In summary, the function does not handle all edge cases properly, thus making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It checks each element in `lst` based on their index. If the index is odd and the corresponding element in `lst` is even, the function returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any such condition that triggers a `False` return, it returns `True`. Thus, the function ensures that all elements at odd indices in the list are not even. The final state of the program indicates whether the list meets this condition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
