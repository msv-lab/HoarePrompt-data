To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, letâ€™s analyze the annotated function `func_1(lst)` against the requirement: to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list.

1. **Understanding the Requirement**: 
   - The function should ensure that for every odd index (1, 3, 5, ...) in the list, the number at that index must be an odd number.

2. **Analyzing the Code**: 
   - The code iterates through each index of the list.
   - It checks if the index `i` is odd (`i % 2 != 0`).
   - If the index is odd, it then checks if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it returns `False`, indicating that not all odd indices contain odd numbers.
   - If the loop completes without returning `False`, it returns `True`, implying all odd indices passed the condition.

3. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The annotated program correctly identifies that if an index is odd and the corresponding element is even, it should return `False`.
   - However, it does not check if an odd index contains an odd number; it only checks for even numbers.
   - According to the problem description, every odd index should contain an odd number. The program's logic does not explicitly require odd numbers at odd indices; it only ensures that no even numbers are at those indices.
   - This leads to a logical gap: an odd number can be at an even index or the odd index can have an odd number, which is not properly checked by the current code.

4. **Example Cases**:
   - For a list like `[1, 2, 3]`, index `1` has the value `2` (even), hence it returns `False`, which is correct as it violates the requirement.
   - For a list like `[1, 1, 3, 5]`, it returns `True` since index `1` has `1` (odd), which is correct.
   - However, if we had a list like `[1, 1, 3, 2, 5]`, index `3` contains an even number `2`, which also results in `False`, accurately reflecting conditions. But it doesn't check or validate the odd indexed requirements correctly.

The program fails to successfully validate all the requirements laid out in the problem description because it incorrectly identifies conditions by checking for even values instead of ensuring that odd indices contain odd numbers.

Based on this analysis, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**
