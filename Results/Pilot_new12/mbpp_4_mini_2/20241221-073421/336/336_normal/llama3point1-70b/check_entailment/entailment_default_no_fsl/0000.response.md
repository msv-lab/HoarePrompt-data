Correctness: **False**

The provided program checks whether every element at odd indices of the list is an odd number. While it correctly returns `False` when it finds an even number at an odd index, it does not handle cases where the list could potentially have elements that are negative or zero, even though the prompt assumes valid input. 

However, the program also incorrectly determines that the conditions are met when it returns `True`; this is true only when it encounters no even number at an odd index, but it does not account for the cases where the odd-index positions might not contain odd numbers. Thus, there could be cases, for example with an input list like `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, where `lst[1]` is even, which would make the result `False`, but no even number in odd indices means the output might not reflect the intended requirement defined in the problem statement where it states every odd index must contain an odd number.

Therefore, there are cases where the code does not align with the problem requirements, leading to its incorrectness.
