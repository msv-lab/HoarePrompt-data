You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the given program, we need to consider the problem description: the program should check whether every odd index in the list contains odd numbers.

Let's analyze the provided function:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True
```

### Analysis:

1. The function iterates through all indices of the list using a range based on the length of the list.
2. For each index, it checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and if the corresponding value in the list at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
3. If it finds an odd index with an even number, it returns `False`.
4. If it completes the loop without returning `False`, it returns `True`.

However, let's consider edge cases:

- **Case with an empty list**: 
  - Input: `[]` 
  - Expected Output: `True` (there are no odd indices to check).
  - Actual Output: `True` (the function would return True correctly since the loop doesn't execute).

- **Case with a single element**:
  - Input: `[1]` 
  - Expected Output: `True` (the only index is 0, which is not odd).
  - Actual Output: `True` (as the loop doesn't check any odd indices).

- **Case with two elements**:
  - Input: `[1, 2]` 
  - Expected Output: `False` (index 1 is odd and the number at that index is even).
  - Actual Output: `False` (correct).

- **Case with an odd-indexed even number**:
  - Input: `[3, 4, 5]` 
  - Expected Output: `False` (index 1 is odd and has an even number).
  - Actual Output: `False` (correct).

- **Case with all odd numbers**:
  - Input: `[1, 3, 5, 7]` 
  - Expected Output: `True` (all odd numbers, odd indices are fine).
  - Actual Output: `True` (correct).

- **Case with mixed even and odd on odd indices**:
  - Input: `[2, 3, 4, 5]` 
  - Expected Output: `False` (index 1 has odd number).
  - Actual Output: `False` (this one is incorrectly handled since it incorrectly counts the odd number on the odd index).

### Conclusion:
The function fails on the key aspect of the problem statement: it is only checking for even numbers at odd indices, and does not define the behavior for odd numbers at those indices. Since the function returns True for odd numbers at odd indices but the problem doesn't specify that those are acceptable, it fails the requirement of being strictly in accordance with the description.

Thus, based on our exploration of input cases, we find:
Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to the length of `lst`. If `i` is odd, `lst[i-1]` must be odd or `lst[i]` must be odd; otherwise, the function would return False. If `i` is even, there are no specific conditions to satisfy post-loop execution.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the conditions for the length of the list 'lst' have been satisfied, as 'i' is even and therefore does not impose any specific conditions.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It checks each element in `lst` based on their index. If the index is odd and the corresponding element in `lst` is even, the function returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any such condition that triggers a `False` return, it returns `True`. Thus, the function ensures that all elements at odd indices in the list are not even. The final state of the program indicates whether the list meets this condition.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
