The original assessment of the program's correctness stated that it is **False**. Let's analyze the program, the problem description, and the annotations to validate this assessment.

1. **Problem Description**: The function is supposed to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers in a given list.

2. **Program Functionality**: The given function `func_1(lst)` iterates over the indices of the list. For any odd index, if the element at that index is even, it returns `False`. If no such condition is met, it returns `True`. 

3. **Analysis of the Code Logic**:
   - The loop does check every index, but it only applies relevant logic for odd indices. 
   - According to the problem statement, the function should determine if all elements at odd indices of the list are odd, which means if the element at an odd index is even, it should return `False`.
   - The return value of `True` is reached if all checks pass, indicating that no even numbers were found at odd indices.

4. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations describe the state of the program and clarify that if `i` is odd and `lst[i]` is even, it will return `False`, which aligns with the function's intended behavior.
   - The annotations suggest that once the function completes, if there were no violations (i.e., even numbers at odd indices), it will return `True`. This matches the requirement to return `True` when all odd indices contain odd numbers.

5. **Consideration of Edge Cases**:
   - The original assessment mentions the handling of lists with less than two elements or empty lists. The edge case of an empty list `[]` returns `True`, which is correct since there are technically no odd indices to violate the requirement.
   - The function also correctly identifies odd and even numbers according to the index.

Given this analysis, it is clear that the function meets the problem description of checking odd indices for odd numbers adequately. The original assessment was incorrect because it overlooked the function handling of cases appropriately as per the provided problem statement.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct based on the logic described and the annotations clarify the behavior.

Final: **True**
