Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It checks each element in `lst` based on their index. If the index is odd and the corresponding element in `lst` is even, the function returns `False`. If the function completes the iteration without finding any such condition that triggers a `False` return, it returns `True`. Thus, the function ensures that all elements at odd indices in the list are not even. The final state of the program indicates whether the list meets this condition.**
