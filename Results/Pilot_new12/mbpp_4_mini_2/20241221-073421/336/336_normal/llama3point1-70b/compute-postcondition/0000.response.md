According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. The loop will iterate for each element in `lst`. If `lst` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, for the loop to be executed successfully, `lst` must contain at least one integer, `i` will start at 0, and will increment until it is equal to the length of `lst`. 

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0**
