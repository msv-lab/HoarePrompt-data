The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. The function has multiple return cases: 

- In Case_1, the function returns `False`.
- In Case_2, the function again returns `False`.
- In Case_3, the function continues to return `False`.
- In Case_4, the function returns `True`, indicating that the conditions for the length of the list `lst` have been satisfied, as `i` is even and does not impose any specific conditions.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and evaluate certain conditions to return either `False` in multiple scenarios or `True` when specific conditions are met regarding the evenness of `i`.  

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst (a list of integers) and returns False in several cases, or True if specific conditions regarding the length of lst have been satisfied.**
