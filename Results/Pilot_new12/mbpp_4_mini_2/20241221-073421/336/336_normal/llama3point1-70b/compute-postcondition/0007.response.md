According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the length of `lst`. Since `lst` has at least 2 elements, the loop can potentially execute until `i` is equal to `len(lst) - 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1. Therefore, the next value for `i` will be 2. 

Consequently, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 2 and it should still hold that `lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
