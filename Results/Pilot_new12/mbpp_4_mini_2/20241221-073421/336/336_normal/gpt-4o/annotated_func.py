#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers where all elements at odd indices are odd, and if `lst` has at least 2 elements, otherwise the loop does not execute at all.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the condition is satisfied since `lst` is a list of integers where all elements at odd indices are odd, and it has at least 2 elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It checks all elements at odd indices in the list. If any of these elements is even, the function returns `False`. If no even elements are found at the odd indices and the list contains at least 2 elements, it returns `True`. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, the for loop does not execute, and the function will return `True` as well, which could be misleading since the segment to check for odd-indexed elements will never run. Thus, the final state might indicate that the condition of odd-indexed elements being odd is satisfied if the list is too short, despite any actual even elements at those indices not being checked.
