To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic within the `func_1` function according to the problem description: "Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list."

1. The function iterates through the list, starting at index 1 (the first odd index), and checks if the number at that index is even.
2. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`.
3. If it completes the loop without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

Now we should evaluate if `func_1` satisfies all potential cases:

### Test Cases to Consider:

- **Case 1:** Input list is empty `[]`
  - Odd indices: none. Thus, it should return `True` based on the description.
- **Case 2:** Input list with one item `[2]`
  - Odd index: none. Should return `True`.
- **Case 3:** Input list with two items `[1, 2]`
  - Odd index (1): `2` (even). Should return `False`.
- **Case 4:** Input list with three items `[1, 3, 2]`
  - Odd index (1): `3` (odd). Should return `True`.
- **Case 5:** Input list with four items `[2, 4, 1, 3]`
  - Odd index (1): `4` (even). Should return `False`.
- **Case 6:** Input list with more items `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Odd indices: `1 (1)`, `3 (4)`, `5 (6)`. The presence of `4` (even) at index `3` should yield `False`.
  
### Conclusion:

The program does not handle the case where a single item even at an odd index (i.e., list with even numbers at odd indices) correctly when odd indices conditions apply. Specifically, as seen in the additional test cases above, the implementation also returns `True` for cases where it should not, based on the presence of an even number.

Thus, I can identify that there are indeed cases where the implementation will fail to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**
