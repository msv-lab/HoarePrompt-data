Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in how the function `func_1` handles lists with fewer than 2 elements.

According to the problem description, the function needs to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers. The program's logic correctly checks odd indices for even numbers and returns `False` if it finds one. However, if the list has less than 2 elements, the loop that checks the odd indices will not execute, and the function will return `True` by default. This is misleading because the function does not actually verify the condition at all if there are not enough elements to check; therefore, it incorrectly implies that the condition is satisfied.

For example:
- For a list like `[2]`, which has no odd indices to check, the function returns `True`, yet it does not satisfy the requirement to check if odd indices contain odd numbers (since there are no odd indices in this case).

Thus, the function fails to meet the problem's requirements in cases where the list has fewer than 2 elements, leading to incorrect conclusions about the contents of odd indices.
