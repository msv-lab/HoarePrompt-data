You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic within the `func_1` function according to the problem description: "Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list."

1. The function iterates through the list, starting at index 1 (the first odd index), and checks if the number at that index is even.
2. If it finds any even number at an odd index, it returns `False`.
3. If it completes the loop without finding any even numbers at odd indices, it returns `True`.

Now we should evaluate if `func_1` satisfies all potential cases:

### Test Cases to Consider:

- **Case 1:** Input list is empty `[]`
  - Odd indices: none. Thus, it should return `True` based on the description.
- **Case 2:** Input list with one item `[2]`
  - Odd index: none. Should return `True`.
- **Case 3:** Input list with two items `[1, 2]`
  - Odd index (1): `2` (even). Should return `False`.
- **Case 4:** Input list with three items `[1, 3, 2]`
  - Odd index (1): `3` (odd). Should return `True`.
- **Case 5:** Input list with four items `[2, 4, 1, 3]`
  - Odd index (1): `4` (even). Should return `False`.
- **Case 6:** Input list with more items `[2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`
  - Odd indices: `1 (1)`, `3 (4)`, `5 (6)`. The presence of `4` (even) at index `3` should yield `False`.
  
### Conclusion:

The program does not handle the case where a single item even at an odd index (i.e., list with even numbers at odd indices) correctly when odd indices conditions apply. Specifically, as seen in the additional test cases above, the implementation also returns `True` for cases where it should not, based on the presence of an even number.

Thus, I can identify that there are indeed cases where the implementation will fail to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It checks all elements at odd indices in the list. If any of these elements is even, the function returns `False`. If no even elements are found at the odd indices and the list contains at least 2 elements, it returns `True`. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, the for loop does not execute, and the function will return `True` as well, which could be misleading since the segment to check for odd-indexed elements will never run. Thus, the final state might indicate that the condition of odd-indexed elements being odd is satisfied if the list is too short, despite any actual even elements at those indices not being checked.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
