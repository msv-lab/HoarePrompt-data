The original assessment of the program's correctness is **False**, and this is justified for several reasons based on the problem description and analysis of the program's behavior.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem description requires a function that checks if every odd index of a list contains an odd number. This means that indices like 1, 3, 5, etc., should hold odd values while indices like 0, 2, 4, etc., are not relevant to this specific verification.

2. **Program Logic**: The function `func_1` iterates through all odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) of the provided list to check if any of those indices contain even numbers. If any even number is found, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.

3. **Issue with Implementation**: 
   - With the example `[4, 1, 2]`, it checks index 1 where the value is `1` (which is odd) and concludes the list passes the check since it does not find an even number at odd indices. However, the number `4` at index `0` does not matter to the condition being checked, which is misleading.
   - An empty list does not contain any odd indexed elements to check, and the function returns `True`. This return value could lead to the incorrect assumption that the condition is satisfied, while technically there were no odd-indexed elements to validate.

4. **Output Hints Validation**: The output hints correctly summarize the intended function's functionality but highlight that the function does not cover the case when the list length is less than 2, which is essential in the context of checking conditions for odd indices.

Based on this comprehensive analysis, the original assessment that the program is incorrect aligns with the problem description and the output hints highlighting significant flaws in the implementation.

Final: **False**
