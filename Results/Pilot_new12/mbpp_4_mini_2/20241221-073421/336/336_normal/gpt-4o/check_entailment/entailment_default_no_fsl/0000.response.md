Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input list has fewer than 2 elements. As per the problem description, the requirement is to check whether every odd index contains an odd number. However, if the list has only one element or is empty, the function returns `True`, which is misleading since there are no odd indices to check. For instance, in the case of an empty list `[]`, the function erroneously returns `True`, while it should be expected that there are odd indexed elements to evaluate. Thus, this indicates that the program does not follow the problem description in every potential case.
