To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the implementation of the function `func_1` in relation to the problem description.

### Problem description:
The function must check whether every element at an odd index in a list contains odd numbers.

### Analysis of the provided program:
1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst)` iterates through the elements of the list starting from index 1 (the first odd index) and checks if each of those elements is even.

2. **Logic of the Loop**:
   - The loop `for i in range(1, len(lst), 2)` correctly targets the odd indices of the list.
   - Inside the loop, the condition `if lst[i] % 2 == 0` checks if the current element (at an odd index) is even. If it finds an even number, it returns `False`.

3. **Return Value**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

### Verification against the problem description:
- The function accurately checks that all elements at the odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) of the list are odd.
- It returns `True` only if all odd indices contain odd numbers and returns `False` as soon as it finds an even number.

### Example Cases:
- **Case 1**: For the input `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`, the odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) correspond to elements `[1, 3, 7, 3]`, all of which are odd, so it returns `True`.
- **Case 2**: For `[4, 1, 2]`, the odd index (1) corresponds to `1`, which is odd, so it returns `True`.
- **Case 3**: For `[1, 2, 3]`, the odd index (1) corresponds to `2`, which is even, hence it returns `False`.

The function behaves exactly as expected based on the problem description given. It correctly identifies whether all elements at odd indices are odd.

### Conclusion:
Since the implementation of the function correctly verifies that all elements at odd indices are indeed odd and handles the specified cases as outlined in the problem description, we conclude that the function meets the requirements.

Correctness: **True**
