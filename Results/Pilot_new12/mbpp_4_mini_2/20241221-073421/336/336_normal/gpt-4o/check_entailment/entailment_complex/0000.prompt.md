You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers where all elements at odd indices are odd, and if `lst` has at least 2 elements, otherwise the loop does not execute at all.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the condition is satisfied since `lst` is a list of integers where all elements at odd indices are odd, and it has at least 2 elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It checks all elements at odd indices in the list. If any of these elements is even, the function returns `False`. If no even elements are found at the odd indices and the list contains at least 2 elements, it returns `True`. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, the for loop does not execute, and the function will return `True` as well, which could be misleading since the segment to check for odd-indexed elements will never run. Thus, the final state might indicate that the condition of odd-indexed elements being odd is satisfied if the list is too short, despite any actual even elements at those indices not being checked.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
