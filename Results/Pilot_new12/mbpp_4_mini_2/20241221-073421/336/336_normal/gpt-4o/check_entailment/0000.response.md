Correctness: **False**.

The problem description requires checking whether every odd index contains odd numbers. However, the following case reveals a problem with the current implementation:

Consider the input list `[4, 1, 2]`. The function returns `True`, which is incorrect. The odd index `1` has the value `1`, which is odd; however, the odd index `0` (which is technically not being checked since the condition specifies odd indices) has the even number `4`.

Another problem occurs when the input list is empty. The function currently treats the empty input as valid, returning `True`, which doesn't satisfy the intent to check odd indices. Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the logic based on the problem description in all potential cases.
