According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the list `lst`. The loop will execute if the length of `lst` is at least 2, since the range starts at 1 and increments by 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list must contain at least 2 integers. After the last iteration, `i` will indicate the last position accessed within the valid range. 

To summarize, for the loop to execute:

1. The length of `lst` must be at least 2.
2. `i` will start at 1, which is the first index to be accessed in the loop.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**
