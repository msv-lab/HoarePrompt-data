According to the code, the for loop is iterating over the indices of `lst` starting from 1 and incrementing by 2 in each iteration, effectively accessing the odd indices. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and the list `lst` has at least 4 elements. Therefore, `len(lst) >= 4`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 2, resulting in `i` becoming 5.

Now we must also ensure that `i` (which will now be 5) is still a valid index for `lst`. Given at least 4 elements in `lst`, and since we started from index 1 and are stepping by 2s, we conclude that for the loop to execute again, `len(lst)` must be greater than or equal to 6 (the next valid index for `i` after 5).

State: **`lst` is a list of integers with at least 6 elements, `i` is 5**.
