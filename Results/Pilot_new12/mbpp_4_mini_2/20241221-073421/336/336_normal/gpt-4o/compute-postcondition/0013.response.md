Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is expected to be a list of integers. It checks all elements at odd indices in the list. If any of these elements is even, the function returns `False`. If no even elements are found at the odd indices and the list contains at least 2 elements, it returns `True`. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, the for loop does not execute, and the function will return `True` as well, which could be misleading since the segment to check for odd-indexed elements will never run. Thus, the final state might indicate that the condition of odd-indexed elements being odd is satisfied if the list is too short, despite any actual even elements at those indices not being checked.**
