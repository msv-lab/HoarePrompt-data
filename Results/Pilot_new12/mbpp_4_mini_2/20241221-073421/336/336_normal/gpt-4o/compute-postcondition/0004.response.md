According to the code, the loop iterates over `lst` starting from index 1 and increments `i` by 2 in each iteration. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the length of `lst`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and given that `lst` has at least 2 integers, it can have a minimum length of 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to become 3, and for that to happen, `lst` must have at least 4 integers (so that the index 3 exists).

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that has at least 4 integers, `i` is 3, and the element at index `i` of `lst` is odd.**
