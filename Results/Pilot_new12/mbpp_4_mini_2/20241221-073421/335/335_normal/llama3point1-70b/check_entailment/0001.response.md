To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the description, let's first break down the requirements:

1. **Function Purpose:** The function is meant to find the occurrence and position of a given substring within a larger string.
2. **Return Value:** If there is a match, it should return a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position (inclusive). If there is no match, it should return `None`.

Now, let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)
```

### Analysis of the Code:

- The `find` method will return the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`. If `substring` isn't found, it returns `-1`, which the code correctly checks for and returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, it calculates the end index correctly as `start + len(substring)` and returns a tuple with the substring and its starting and ending positions (`end - 1`).

### Edge Cases:

1. **Empty Strings:**
   - If `string` is empty and `substring` is also empty, is it correct? Ideally, returning `(substring, 0, 0)` would make sense because the empty substring is found at position 0.
   - If `string` is empty and `substring` is non-empty, it correctly returns `None`, which is correct.
   
2. **Substring Not Found:**
   - When the substring does not exist in the string, returning `None` is correct.

3. **Multiple Occurrences:**
   - The function only finds the first occurrence and does not consider subsequent matches. If there are multiple occurrences, the requirement for returning details about all occurrences isn't accommodated. The prompt is vague about this, but if we take "occurrence" in terms of all occurrences, then the function fails.

### Test Cases:

- If we consider the function with:
  1. `func_1("hello", "lo")` returns `('lo', 3, 4)` - correct.
  2. `func_1("hello", "world")` returns `None` - correct.
  3. `func_1("", "")` would return `None`, which might be incorrect if an empty substring is considered valid (needs clarification).
  4. `func_1("banana", "na")` returns `('na', 2, 3)` which is the first occurrence, but there's also a second occurrence starting at index 4.

### Conclusion:

The program does not work correctly if we consider the potential need to handle multiple occurrences or the empty substring case.

Correctness: **False** 

### Reason:
The program does not account for multiple occurrences of the substring, which could be interpreted as a requirement depending on the problem statement's vague wording. If multiple matches are expected, the function fails to address this, thus making it incorrect.
