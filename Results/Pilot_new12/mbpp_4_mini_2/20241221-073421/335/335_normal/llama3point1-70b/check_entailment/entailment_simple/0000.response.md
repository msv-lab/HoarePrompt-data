Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should find "the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string," which implies that the function must return all occurrences and their respective positions, not just the first one.

The provided function only identifies and returns information about the first occurrence of the substring, and does not account for multiple occurrences throughout the string. If the substring appears multiple times, the program fails to return details about those additional occurrences. Additionally, the problem description states that it should return "None" if there are no matches, which the program correctly implements, but it does not specify what to return in cases of multiple occurrences.

Therefore, the program does not satisfy all aspects of the problem description, as it lacks functionality for handling multiple occurrences of the substring.
