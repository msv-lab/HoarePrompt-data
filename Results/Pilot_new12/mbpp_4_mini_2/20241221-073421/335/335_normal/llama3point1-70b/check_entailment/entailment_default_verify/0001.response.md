Final: **False**

Reason: The program does not account for multiple occurrences of the substring within the string, which could be a significant oversight depending on the interpretation of the problem statement. The original assessment correctly identifies this issue, emphasizing the function's limitation in only returning the first occurrence of the substring rather than all occurrences. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function does not handle edge cases involving empty strings or multiple occurrences well. Therefore, the original assessment holds true, as the program does not meet the complete requirements outlined in the problem description.
