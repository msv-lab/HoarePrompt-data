Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to handle cases where a substring occurs multiple times within the main string. The problem description implies that the function should find all occurrences and positions of a substring, but the current implementation only finds the first occurrence and returns that. For instance, if the input string is "abcabc" and the substring is "abc", the expected behavior would be to return the positions of both occurrences, but the function will only return the first one. This demonstrates that the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
