Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem explicitly states that the function should find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string and implies that all occurrences should be accounted for. However, the current implementation only returns the first occurrence of the substring, failing to address the requirement to capture multiple occurrences. The output hints further confirm this limitation by stating that the function "does not handle multiple occurrences of `substring`," which aligns with the original assessment of the program's correctness as **False**.
