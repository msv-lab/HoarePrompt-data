Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. Although it successfully finds the occurrence and position of the first substring within a string and returns None when the substring is not found, it fails to handle multiple occurrences of the substring.

The problem description mentions "the occurrence and position of the substrings," which implicitly suggests that it should account for all occurrences of the substring within the string. However, the annotated program only returns the first occurrence and does not list any additional occurrences or convey that there may be more. Therefore, it does not satisfy the broader interpretation of the problem statement to find all occurrences.

In summary, the program's restriction to the first occurrence alone does not fulfill the requirement of finding all occurrences of the substring, resulting in an incorrect implementation based on the problem description.
