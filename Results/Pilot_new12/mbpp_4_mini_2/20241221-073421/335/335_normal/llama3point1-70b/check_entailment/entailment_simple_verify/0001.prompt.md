You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the description, let's first break down the requirements:

1. **Function Purpose:** The function is meant to find the occurrence and position of a given substring within a larger string.
2. **Return Value:** If there is a match, it should return a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position (inclusive). If there is no match, it should return `None`.

Now, let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if start == -1:
        return None
    end = start + len(substring)
    return (substring, start, end - 1)
```

### Analysis of the Code:

- The `find` method will return the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`. If `substring` isn't found, it returns `-1`, which the code correctly checks for and returns `None`.
- If the substring is found, it calculates the end index correctly as `start + len(substring)` and returns a tuple with the substring and its starting and ending positions (`end - 1`).

### Edge Cases:

1. **Empty Strings:**
   - If `string` is empty and `substring` is also empty, is it correct? Ideally, returning `(substring, 0, 0)` would make sense because the empty substring is found at position 0.
   - If `string` is empty and `substring` is non-empty, it correctly returns `None`, which is correct.
   
2. **Substring Not Found:**
   - When the substring does not exist in the string, returning `None` is correct.

3. **Multiple Occurrences:**
   - The function only finds the first occurrence and does not consider subsequent matches. If there are multiple occurrences, the requirement for returning details about all occurrences isn't accommodated. The prompt is vague about this, but if we take "occurrence" in terms of all occurrences, then the function fails.

### Test Cases:

- If we consider the function with:
  1. `func_1("hello", "lo")` returns `('lo', 3, 4)` - correct.
  2. `func_1("hello", "world")` returns `None` - correct.
  3. `func_1("", "")` would return `None`, which might be incorrect if an empty substring is considered valid (needs clarification).
  4. `func_1("banana", "na")` returns `('na', 2, 3)` which is the first occurrence, but there's also a second occurrence starting at index 4.

### Conclusion:

The program does not work correctly if we consider the potential need to handle multiple occurrences or the empty substring case.

Correctness: **False** 

### Reason:
The program does not account for multiple occurrences of the substring, which could be interpreted as a requirement depending on the problem statement's vague wording. If multiple matches are expected, the function fails to address this, thus making it incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a non-empty string, and substring is a non-empty string.
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if (start == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that the operation does not produce a result.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, and `start` is greater than or equal to 0.
    end = start + len(substring)
    return substring, start, end - 1
    #The program returns the substring along with the start index of its first occurrence and the end index (which is end - 1) where the substring appears in the string. The start index is greater than or equal to 0, and end is equal to start + len(substring).


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
