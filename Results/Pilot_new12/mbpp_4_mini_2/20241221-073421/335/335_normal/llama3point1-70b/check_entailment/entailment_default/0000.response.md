Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The provided function correctly identifies the first occurrence of a substring within a string and returns its starting and ending indices as specified. However, the problem description is broader, as it asks to find the occurrence and position of all substrings within the string, not just the first one. The function only returns information for the first found occurrence and ignores any subsequent occurrences. Additionally, it does not address the scenario where the input string or substring could be empty. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement of covering "every potential case" for the problem description.
