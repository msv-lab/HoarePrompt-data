The original assessment stated that the program's correctness is **False** because it fails to handle cases where the substring occurs multiple times within the main string. The problem description requires the function to find all occurrences and positions of the substring, but the current implementation only finds and returns the first occurrence.

This reasoning is supported by the annotated version of the code, which further clarifies that while the function does correctly identify the first occurrence of the substring and return its position, it does not account for subsequent occurrences at all. It will return `None` if the substring is not found, but if it is found, it only retrieves the first instance, thus not fulfilling the requirement to find all occurrences.

The following points emphasize the correctness of the original assessment:
- The program only searches for the first occurrence of the substring without any mechanism to find or return additional occurrences.
- The explanation in the annotations confirms that the function is limited by only returning the first found occurrence, thus failing to meet the main requirement in the problem description.

Thus, the original assessment of correctness being **False** is justified and consistent based on both the problem description and the behavior of the program as outlined in the annotations.

Final: **False**
