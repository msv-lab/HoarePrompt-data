Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Although it correctly identifies the first occurrence of a non-empty substring within a given non-empty string and returns the appropriate tuple, it fails to handle two specific cases:

1. It does not return an appropriate response when the input strings are empty. According to the problem description, the function should return `None` if there is no match, but it doesn't specify how to handle empty strings. An empty string for either the `string` or `substring` can cause ambiguity.

2. The function only returns the first occurrence of `substring`, while the problem description requires finding all occurrences. If there are multiple occurrences of the substring in the string, the code fails to return any information beyond the first match.

Due to these shortcomings, particularly the lack of handling for edge cases and multiple occurrences, the program is incorrect.
