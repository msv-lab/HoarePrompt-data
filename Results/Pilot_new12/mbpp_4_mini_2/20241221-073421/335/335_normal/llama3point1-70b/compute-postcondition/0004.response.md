The value of `end` is assigned the result of `start + len(substring)`. Since `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, this means `end` will be the index where the occurrence of `substring` ends in `string`. The information about `string`, `substring`, and `start` remains valid after execution, but now `end` has a specific value based on the length of `substring`. 

Thus, the Output State is: `string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `start` is greater than or equal to 0, and `end` is equal to `start + len(substring)`.

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, `start` is greater than or equal to 0, and `end` is equal to `start + len(substring)`.**
