The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string` and `substring`. Both `string` and `substring` are non-empty strings. The function has two possible outcomes: 

Case 1: The function returns `None`, indicating that the operation does not produce a result. 

Case 2: The function returns the `substring` along with the start index of its first occurrence and the end index (which is end - 1) where the `substring` appears in the `string`. The start index is greater than or equal to 0, and the end index is equal to the start index plus the length of the `substring`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-empty strings, `string` and `substring`, and either not produce a result or provide the indices of the first occurrence of the `substring` within the `string`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-empty strings, `string` and `substring`. It returns `None` if there is no occurrence of `substring`. If `substring` exists in `string`, it returns `substring`, the start index of its first occurrence, and the end index.**
