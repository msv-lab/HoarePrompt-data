The function accepts two non-empty strings, `string` and `substring`. It first searches for the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`. If `substring` is not found, the function returns `None`. If `substring` is found, the function returns a tuple consisting of `substring`, the start index of its first occurrence, and the end index (exclusive) calculated as the start index plus the length of `substring`. The start index is guaranteed to be zero or greater if `substring` exists in `string`. However, the function does not handle cases where `string` or `substring` are empty, nor does it handle multiple occurrences of `substring`, as it always returns the first occurrence found, if any.
