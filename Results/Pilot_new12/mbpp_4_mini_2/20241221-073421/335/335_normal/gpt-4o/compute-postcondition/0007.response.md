Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters: `main_string` and `sub_string` (where `sub_string` is guaranteed to be non-empty). It searches for the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, it returns None. If it is found, the function returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, the start index of its first occurrence (`start_pos`), and the end index of that occurrence (`end_pos`, which is calculated as `start_pos` plus the length of `sub_string`). The function does not handle cases where `main_string` or `sub_string` may be None, nor does it address scenarios where either parameter is not a string. Overall, it provides information about the location of `sub_string` within `main_string`, or indicates its absence.**
