`end_pos` is assigned the value of `start_pos` plus the length of `sub_string`. Since `start_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string` and `sub_string` is not an empty string, `len(sub_string)` is a positive integer. Therefore, `end_pos` will be equal to `start_pos` plus a positive integer, which results in a value greater than `start_pos`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a string, `sub_string` is not an empty string, `start_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`, `start_pos` is greater than or equal to 0, and `end_pos` is `start_pos + len(sub_string)`.**
