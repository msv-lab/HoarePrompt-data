The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `main_string` and `sub_string`. Both parameters are strings, and `sub_string` is guaranteed to be non-empty. If `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, the function returns `None`, indicating that there is no relevant value to return. If `sub_string` is found, the function returns `sub_string`, the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string` (referred to as `start_pos`), and the calculated ending position (`end_pos`), which is `start_pos` plus the length of `sub_string`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `main_string` and a non-empty string `sub_string`, and return either `None` if `sub_string` is not found or the `sub_string` along with its starting and ending positions in `main_string` if it is found.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters: `main_string` and `sub_string` (which is non-empty). It returns None if `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, or returns `sub_string`, the index of its first occurrence, and its ending position if it is found.**
