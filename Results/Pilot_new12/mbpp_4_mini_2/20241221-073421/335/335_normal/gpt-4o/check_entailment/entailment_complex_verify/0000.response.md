The original assessment stated the correctness of the program is **False** because it claimed the function does not handle the case where the substring appears multiple times in the main string. While it's true that the function only returns the first occurrence of the substring, the problem description clearly does not specify that all occurrences must be returned, only that it should find the occurrence and position of the substrings within the string and return None if there is no match. Given this clarification, the focus of the implementation is aligned with the problem description, as it successfully retrieves the start and end positions of the first occurrence of the substring if it exists, or returns None if it does not.

Based on the annotated version of the code and its explanation, the function behaves as intended according to the problem description. The provided annotations confirm that the function correctly identifies the first occurrence of the substring and returns the appropriate values.

Therefore, the original assessment does not accurately reflect the definition of the problem. 

Final: **True**
