Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case where the substring occurs multiple times in the main string. For example, if the input is `func_1('python python programming, python language', 'python')`, the expected behavior would be to return the first occurrence, but it only returns the first occurrence of 'python', which is correct. However, if the problem description implies that all occurrences and their positions should be identified and returned, then the code is incomplete. 

Furthermore, the examples assume that there is only one match or that the main string does not contain any additional information beyond that, indicating a limitation in functionality. Thus, there are potential cases where the substring occurrence and its positions are not fully handled.
