Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input parameters, `main_string` or `sub_string`, may be `None` or non-string types. While the problem description implies that `sub_string` is guaranteed to be non-empty, it does not specify the types of `main_string` and `sub_string` beyond them being strings.

A potential case where the function would fail is if either parameter is `None`. For example, calling `func_1(None, 'python')` would raise an error. Additionally, there's no validation to ensure both parameters are strings, which could lead to unexpected behavior if users provide types that are not strings.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
