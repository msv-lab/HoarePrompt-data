Based on the problem description, the task is to find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string and return None if there is no match. 

The provided program, `func_1`, correctly handles finding a single occurrence of a substring and returning its starting and ending positions. This is confirmed by the given assertions which match the expected output for various inputs. 

However, the original assessment states that the program is "incomplete" because it only accounts for first occurrences instead of all occurrences of the substring, which might imply that the function should provide comprehensive results rather than just handling a single case. The original assessment indicates a concern that there are potential cases where the substring occurrence and its positions are not fully handled, which could lead to misunderstanding the functional requirements of the problem description.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function, as implemented, does return correct results for the given inputs it has been assessed against, and I note that no additional requirements for handling multiple occurrences were provided in the problem description itself. Given that the program meets the specific examples provided and handles the cases where the substring is not found appropriately, I have to conclude that the implementation, although limited in scope to the first occurrence of a substring, correctly implements what was asked in the problem description.

Thus, given that the function indeed behaves as specified in the problem description and the annotations reflect expected outcomes for the provided scenarios, I would revise the original assessment.

Final: **True**
