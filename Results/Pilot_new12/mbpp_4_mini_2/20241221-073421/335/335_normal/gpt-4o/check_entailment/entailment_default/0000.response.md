Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` is intended to find the occurrence and position of a substring within the main string. However, it does not handle cases where `main_string` or `sub_string` may be None, nor does it address scenarios where either parameter is not a string type. While the function works correctly for the given examples, it could break or return unexpected results if the inputs were invalid, even though it is assumed the inputs will be valid. Furthermore, if `sub_string` were an empty string, it would not meet the expectations outlined in the problem description. Hence, since the function does not account for these potential cases of invalid input, it does not fulfill the problem requirements in every potential scenario.
