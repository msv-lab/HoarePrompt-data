Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that finds the occurrence and position of a substring within a given string, and returns a tuple containing the substring, its start index, and its end index, or `None` if the substring is not found.

Here's how the function meets the problem description:

1. It accepts two parameters: `main_string` (the string in which to search) and `sub_string` (the substring to find).
2. It uses the `find()` method to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string`. If it is not found, it correctly returns `None`, meeting the requirement to do so when there is no match.
3. If `sub_string` is found, the function calculates the start index (`start_pos`) and the end index (`end_pos`) based on the position returned by `find()`, as well as the length of `sub_string`. It then returns these values in the specified tuple format.

The assertions provided in the annotated program validate the function against various cases, demonstrating that it behaves correctly for both found and not found scenarios. Each test case confirms that the function implementation correctly identifies both the substring position and occurrence, as required by the problem description.

Since the program performs as expected and handles the specified requirements correctly, it is deemed accurate and complete in its functionality according to the problem statement.
