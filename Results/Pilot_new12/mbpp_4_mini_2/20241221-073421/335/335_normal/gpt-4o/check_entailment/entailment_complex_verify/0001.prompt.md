You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the given program, we need to consider the problem description and the implementation provided.

The problem description requires us to find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string and return `None` if there is no match. 

Let's analyze the provided `func_1` function:

1. The function uses `main_string.find(sub_string)` to find the starting position of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If the substring is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function correctly returns `None` in such cases.
2. If the substring is found, it calculates the ending position using `start_pos + len(sub_string)` and returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position.

Now, we need to identify any potential edge cases or missing logic from the description:

- The function currently only finds the first occurrence of the substring. If there are multiple occurrences, it does not handle that.
- The requirement to find "the occurrence and position" could imply that we might need to return information about all occurrences, but the implementation only returns the first one.
- There's no check for case sensitivity; for example, `func_1('Python Programming', 'python')` would return `None`, but it could be argued that it should find the substring in a case-insensitive manner depending on the exact wording of the problem.

Given these considerations, the implementation does not satisfy the requirement of finding all occurrences or potentially consider case insensitivity. 

Therefore, we conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
- The program only returns the first occurrence of the substring instead of all occurrences, which does not align with the potential interpretation of the problem description. For instance, calling `func_1('python python python', 'python')` would not produce correct behavior since it would only return the first occurrence.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

#State of the program right berfore the function call: main_string is a string, sub_string is a string, and sub_string is not an empty string.
def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if (start_pos == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that there is no relevant value to return as 'sub_string' was not found in 'main_string'
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`main_string` is a string, `sub_string` is a string, `sub_string` is not an empty string, `start_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`, and `start_pos` is greater than or equal to 0.
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return sub_string, start_pos, end_pos
    #The program returns sub_string, start_pos (the index of the first occurrence of sub_string in main_string), and end_pos (which is start_pos plus the length of sub_string)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters: `main_string` and `sub_string` (where `sub_string` is guaranteed to be non-empty). It searches for the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, it returns None. If it is found, the function returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, the start index of its first occurrence (`start_pos`), and the end index of that occurrence (`end_pos`, which is calculated as `start_pos` plus the length of `sub_string`). The function does not handle cases where `main_string` or `sub_string` may be None, nor does it address scenarios where either parameter is not a string. Overall, it provides information about the location of `sub_string` within `main_string`, or indicates its absence.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
