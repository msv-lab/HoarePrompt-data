The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** due to the fact that it does not handle cases where the substring occurs more than once within the main string, as well as the assumption that the problem description requires finding all occurrences of the substring.

Upon analyzing the problem description, the requirement is simply to find the occurrence and position of the substring within a string and return `None` if there is no match. The output hints clarify that the function `func_1` is designed to find the first occurrence only, which aligns with the behavior outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment suggesting that additional functionality is required (such as tracking multiple occurrences) does not actually reflect the problem as stated.

The program correctly implements the search for the first occurrence of the substring using the `find` method, and accurately returns the expected tuple with the substring and its start and end positions when found. The program also correctly returns `None` when the substring is not found.

Given this analysis, the original assessment is based on a misunderstanding of the problem requirements. The function does meet the expectations set by the problem description and provides outputs in line with the confirmed output hints.

Thus, I will change the assessment based on the details above.

Final: **True**
