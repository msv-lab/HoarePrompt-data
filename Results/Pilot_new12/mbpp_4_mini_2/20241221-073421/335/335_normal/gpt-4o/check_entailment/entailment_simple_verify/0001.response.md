Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` is limited to finding only the first occurrence of the substring within the main string and returns `None` for cases where the substring is not found. The problem description implies that there may be a need to find all occurrences, as indicated by phrases such as "the occurrence and position." 

The annotations support this assessment by explicitly outlining the return behavior when the substring is found or not found. The limits of the program in handling multiple occurrences of the substring lead to the conclusion that it does not fully meet the problem's requirements. Additionally, there is no mention of case insensitivity, further reinforcing that the implementation may not adhere to a reasonable interpretation of the problem description.

Thus, the conclusion that the program is incorrect remains valid, confirming the original assessment's accuracy.
