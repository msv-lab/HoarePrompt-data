You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python programming, python language', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'programming') == ('programming', 7, 18)
assert func_1('python programming,programming language', 'language') == ('language', 31, 39)
assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None

def func_1(main_string, sub_string):
    start_pos = main_string.find(sub_string)
    if start_pos == -1:
        return None
    end_pos = start_pos + len(sub_string)
    return (sub_string, start_pos, end_pos)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle the case where the substring occurs multiple times in the main string. For example, if the input is `func_1('python python programming, python language', 'python')`, the expected behavior would be to return the first occurrence, but it only returns the first occurrence of 'python', which is correct. However, if the problem description implies that all occurrences and their positions should be identified and returned, then the code is incomplete. 

Furthermore, the examples assume that there is only one match or that the main string does not contain any additional information beyond that, indicating a limitation in functionality. Thus, there are potential cases where the substring occurrence and its positions are not fully handled.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters: `main_string` and `sub_string` (where `sub_string` is guaranteed to be non-empty). It searches for the first occurrence of `sub_string` within `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, it returns None. If it is found, the function returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, the start index of its first occurrence (`start_pos`), and the end index of that occurrence (`end_pos`, which is calculated as `start_pos` plus the length of `sub_string`). The function does not handle cases where `main_string` or `sub_string` may be None, nor does it address scenarios where either parameter is not a string. Overall, it provides information about the location of `sub_string` within `main_string`, or indicates its absence.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
