To assess the correctness of the given program, we need to consider the problem description and the implementation provided.

The problem description requires us to find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string and return `None` if there is no match. 

Let's analyze the provided `func_1` function:

1. The function uses `main_string.find(sub_string)` to find the starting position of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If the substring is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function correctly returns `None` in such cases.
2. If the substring is found, it calculates the ending position using `start_pos + len(sub_string)` and returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting position, and its ending position.

Now, we need to identify any potential edge cases or missing logic from the description:

- The function currently only finds the first occurrence of the substring. If there are multiple occurrences, it does not handle that.
- The requirement to find "the occurrence and position" could imply that we might need to return information about all occurrences, but the implementation only returns the first one.
- There's no check for case sensitivity; for example, `func_1('Python Programming', 'python')` would return `None`, but it could be argued that it should find the substring in a case-insensitive manner depending on the exact wording of the problem.

Given these considerations, the implementation does not satisfy the requirement of finding all occurrences or potentially consider case insensitivity. 

Therefore, we conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
- The program only returns the first occurrence of the substring instead of all occurrences, which does not align with the potential interpretation of the problem description. For instance, calling `func_1('python python python', 'python')` would not produce correct behavior since it would only return the first occurrence.
