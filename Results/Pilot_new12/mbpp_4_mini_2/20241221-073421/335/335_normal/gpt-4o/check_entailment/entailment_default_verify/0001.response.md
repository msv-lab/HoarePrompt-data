Final: **False** 

The original assessment accurately identifies that the program only captures the first occurrence of a substring, which contradicts the implicit requirements suggested by the problem description. The output hints clarify that the function returns a tuple for the first occurrence only, and they don't indicate any handling for multiple occurrences or case insensitivity. Therefore, the limitations discussed in the original assessment remain valid, confirming that the program does not fully meet the problem description's expectations.
