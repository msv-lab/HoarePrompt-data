Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description by finding the occurrence and position of a substring within a given string. 

Hereâ€™s why the program meets the requirements from the problem description:

1. **Finding Substring**: The program uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If the substring is found, it provides the correct starting index (`start_pos`) and calculates the ending index (`end_pos`).

2. **Return Format**: When `sub_string` is found, the program correctly returns a tuple consisting of the `sub_string`, its starting position, and its ending position:
   - For example, in the first assertion, `func_1('python programming, python language', 'python')` correctly returns `('python', 0, 6)` because 'python' starts at index 0 and ends at index 6.

3. **Handling Non-existent Substring**: The program properly returns `None` when the substring is not found in the string, as demonstrated in the fourth assertion where `func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python')` correctly returns `None`.

4. **Valid Input Assumptions**: The function expects valid string inputs, which aligns with the assumption made in the problem description that inputs will not cause any errors. 

Overall, the implementation adheres to the problem's requirements by correctly identifying and returning the occurrence and position of a substring. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
