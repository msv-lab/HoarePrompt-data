The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `n`, which is expected to represent a month number within the range of 1 to 12. It checks if `n` corresponds to a month that has 31 days by determining whether `n` is included in the predefined list of such months `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`. The function returns `True` if `n` is one of these months and `False` otherwise. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the expected range (1 to 12), which could potentially lead to misleading results or exceptions if the input is invalid. Overall, the function focuses on identifying whether a given month number has 31 days.
