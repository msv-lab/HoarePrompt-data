You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly defines a function `func_1` which checks if the given month number (represented as an integer `n`) contains 31 days. The months that contain 31 days are correctly identified as January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

The function uses a list to store the month numbers that have 31 days and checks if the input `n` is present in that list. Since the problem description explicitly asks to check for the presence of the month number in those months, the function correctly fulfills the requirements.

All valid month numbers (1 to 12) are accounted for, and for any input outside this range, it will implicitly return `False`, which is consistent with the problem if it assumes valid month numbers only. Therefore, there are no edge cases that would cause the program to fail based on the provided problem description.

Overall, the function handles the task as requested, validating correctly for each relevant scenario.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer representing a month number such that 1 <= n <= 12.
def func_1(n):
    months_31_days = [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
    return n in months_31_days
    #The program returns whether n is in the list of months with 31 days, which is [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts an integer parameter `n`, which is expected to represent a month number within the range of 1 to 12. It checks if `n` corresponds to a month that has 31 days by determining whether `n` is included in the predefined list of such months `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`. The function returns `True` if `n` is one of these months and `False` otherwise. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the expected range (1 to 12), which could potentially lead to misleading results or exceptions if the input is invalid. Overall, the function focuses on identifying whether a given month number has 31 days.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
