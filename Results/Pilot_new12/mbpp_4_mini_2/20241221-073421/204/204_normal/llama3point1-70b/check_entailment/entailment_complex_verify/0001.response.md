Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(n)` is designed to determine whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 31 days. The annotations clearly state that `n` is an integer representing a month number such that `1 <= n <= 12`, which aligns with the function's intention.

The code checks for membership of `n` in the list of months with 31 days (`[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`), returning `True` if `n` is in that list and `False` otherwise. This functionality fulfills the requirements of the problem as claimed.

While the annotated version mentions that the function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the expected range (1 to 12), the assessment presumes valid input as specified in the problem description. Therefore, incoming values of `n` are implicitly expected to be within that range, making the function correct in the context given.

Overall, the function behaves as desired according to the problem requirements, and thus, the original assessment of correctness stands.
