Correctness: **False**

The program correctly identifies whether a given month number has 31 days for valid inputs from 1 to 12. However, it does not handle the case where the input `n` is outside of the expected range (1 to 12). If an invalid month number (e.g., 0, 13, or a negative number) is provided, the function will incorrectly return `False`, even though technically, those values cannot be considered valid month numbers.

For example:
- If `n = 0`, the program returns `False` (incorrect, because 0 is not a month).
- If `n = 13`, the program also returns `False` (incorrect, because 13 is not a month).

Since the problem statement implies that the function should only operate within the range of valid month numbers, the lack of handling for out-of-range values leads to misleading results. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
