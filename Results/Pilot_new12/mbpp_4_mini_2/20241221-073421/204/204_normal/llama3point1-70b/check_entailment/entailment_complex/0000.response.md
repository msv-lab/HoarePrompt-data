Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that accepts an integer `n` representing a month number within the valid range of 1 to 12. The function checks whether `n` corresponds to a month with 31 days by determining if `n` is included in the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`.

The key points are as follows:
- The function accurately identifies the months that contain 31 days.
- The problem statement queries whether a given month number has 31 days, which the function addresses directly by checking membership in the defined list.
- Although the function does not explicitly handle inputs outside the range of 1 to 12, it is stated that we assume valid input. Therefore, under the given assumptions, the function operates correctly for all valid month numbers.

Thus, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and is deemed to function correctly.
