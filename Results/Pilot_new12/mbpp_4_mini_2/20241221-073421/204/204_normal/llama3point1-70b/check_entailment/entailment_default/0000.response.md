Explanation: The program is designed to check whether the month number corresponds to a month that has 31 days, which is correctly represented by the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`. The function `func_1` returns `True` if the month number `n` is in this list, indicating that the month has 31 days; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

However, the output hints confirm that the function does not handle cases where `n` is outside the expected range of 1 to 12. For instance, if `n` is 13 or 0, the function will still return `False`, which is misleading since these values do not correspond to valid month numbers. This can be considered incorrect behavior for the program requirements as articulated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
