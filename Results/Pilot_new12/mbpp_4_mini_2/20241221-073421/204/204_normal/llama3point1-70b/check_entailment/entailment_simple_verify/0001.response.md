Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately identifies that the function `func_1` checks whether the provided month number (integer `n`) corresponds to a month that contains 31 days. The annotations confirm that prior to the function call, `n` is guaranteed to be a valid month number between 1 and 12. 

The function compares `n` against the predefined list of months with 31 days `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`. It correctly uses the `in` operator to determine if `n` is an element of that list, thus returning the correct boolean result.

Since the problem description explicitly requires checking whether a specified month has 31 days, and the annotated behavior of the function confirms it operates correctly under the assumptions provided (i.e., valid month numbers), the assessment of the program's correctness remains valid. 

Overall, the program implementation is consistent with both the problem requirements and the provided annotations, reinforcing the conclusion that the function is correctly implemented.

Thus, I conclude that the program meets the problem description and is correctly assessed as such.
