Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate as the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a month number is one that contains 31 days, as specified in the problem description. The implementation correctly identifies the months with 31 days by checking if the input `n` is in the list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`. It therefore returns `True` for valid inputs corresponding to these months and `False` otherwise. 

While the output hints point out that the function does not handle invalid month numbers (outside the range of 1 to 12), the problem description does not require such handling, and it is assumed that the input will be valid. Thus, the function adheres to the specified requirements and performs correctly within the expected confines of valid month numbers, maintaining its classification as correct.
