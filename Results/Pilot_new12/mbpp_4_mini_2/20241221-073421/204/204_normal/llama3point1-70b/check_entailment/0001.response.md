Correctness: **True**

The program correctly defines a function `func_1` which checks if the given month number (represented as an integer `n`) contains 31 days. The months that contain 31 days are correctly identified as January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

The function uses a list to store the month numbers that have 31 days and checks if the input `n` is present in that list. Since the problem description explicitly asks to check for the presence of the month number in those months, the function correctly fulfills the requirements.

All valid month numbers (1 to 12) are accounted for, and for any input outside this range, it will implicitly return `False`, which is consistent with the problem if it assumes valid month numbers only. Therefore, there are no edge cases that would cause the program to fail based on the provided problem description.

Overall, the function handles the task as requested, validating correctly for each relevant scenario.
