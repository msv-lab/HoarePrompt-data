Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` accurately checks if a given month number is among those that have 31 days. The annotations confirm that the function is designed to handle valid input month numbers (1 to 12) and correctly returns `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for others. While it is noted that the function does not account for invalid month numbers (0, 13, or negative values), the problem description does not require the function to handle such cases, as it specifies checking only for valid month numbers. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description and the annotations substantiate this conclusion.
