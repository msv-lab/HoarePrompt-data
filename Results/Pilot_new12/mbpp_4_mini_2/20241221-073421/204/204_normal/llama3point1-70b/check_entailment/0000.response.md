Correctness: **True**. 

The provided function checks if a month number (1 through 12) is among those that have 31 days. The months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) are correctly represented in the list `months_31_days`. The function simply checks if the input month number `n` is in this list. 

The function will return `True` for input values 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, and 12, which are all valid months with 31 days, and `False` for all other month numbers (2 for February, 4 for April, 6 for June, 9 for September, and 11 for November) which correctly reflects that those months do not contain 31 days. Additionally, it does not account for invalid month numbers (e.g., 0, 13 or negative values), but since the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases, the function can be considered correct as it meets the requirements for valid month numbers explicitly stated in the problem description.
