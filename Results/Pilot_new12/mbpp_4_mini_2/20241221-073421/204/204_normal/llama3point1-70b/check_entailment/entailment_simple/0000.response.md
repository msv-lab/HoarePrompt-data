Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that checks whether the given month number (represented by the integer `n`) corresponds to a month that contains 31 days.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. **Input Specification**: The function is expected to receive an integer `n` representing a month number, where `1 <= n <= 12`. The program assumes valid input, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Logic for Months with 31 Days**: The function contains a predefined list of months that have 31 days, specifically `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]` which corresponds to January, March, May, July, August, October, and December.

3. **Membership Test**: The program checks if the month number `n` is in the list of months with 31 days using the `in` operator. If `n` is found in the list, it returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days. If not, it returns `False`.

4. **Comprehensiveness**: The function accurately covers all valid months (1 to 12), so it can determine whether any given month has 31 days, thus fulfilling the requirement expressed in the problem statement.

Therefore, since the function performs the required checks and produces the expected outputs for valid inputs, we conclude that it adheres to the problem's requirements.
