The variable `months_31_days` is assigned a list containing the month numbers representing months with 31 days: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`. The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is just represented by the initial condition that it is an integer between 1 and 12. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer representing a month number such that 1 <= `n` <= 12; `months_31_days` is [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12].

Output State: **`n` is an integer representing a month number such that 1 <= `n` <= 12; `months_31_days` is [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]**.
