The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer representing a month number such that 1 <= n <= 12. After executing the function body, it checks if `n` is in the list of months with 31 days, which is [1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` representing a month and return whether `n` is a month with 31 days. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns True if n is a month with 31 days, otherwise returns False.**
