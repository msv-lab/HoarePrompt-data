The function accepts an integer parameter `month`, which must be between 1 and 12 (inclusive), representing the month number. It checks if the provided month has 31 days by determining if it is one of the months defined in the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}. The function concludes by returning `True` if the month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise. However, it does not handle cases where the `month` is outside the expected range (1-12), which may lead to misleading results or runtime errors.
