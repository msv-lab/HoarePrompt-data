Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the input `month` is outside the expected range of 1 to 12. While the function checks for months that have 31 days correctly based on the defined set, it lacks error handling or validation for invalid month numbers. For instance, if the function is called with `func_1(13)` or `func_1(0)`, it would incorrectly return `False` since 13 and 0 are not part of the set and would misleadingly suggest that these inputs represent months that do not have 31 days. Thus, it does not meet the requirements for all potential inputs as specified in the problem description.
