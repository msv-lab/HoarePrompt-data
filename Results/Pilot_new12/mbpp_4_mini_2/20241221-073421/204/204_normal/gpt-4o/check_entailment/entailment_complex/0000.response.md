Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully adhere to the problem description. While it correctly identifies which months have 31 days, it fails to handle the case where the input `month` may be outside the valid range of 1 to 12. 

According to the problem description, the function should check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. However, the absence of explicit handling for out-of-range values (e.g., if `month` were 0 or 13) could yield misleading results or potentially unexpected behavior. The function may erroneously return `False` for values outside the range without raising any error or warning, which is misleading as it does not accurately fulfill the intent of checking whether a valid month has 31 days.

In summary, while the function correctly identifies the months that have 31 days when valid data is provided (1 to 12), it lacks robustness and completeness for the defined problem, as it does not appropriately manage the boundaries or invalid values.
