The program description requires a function to check whether a given month number (from 1 to 12) contains 31 days. The provided function uses a set to determine this and asserts the correctness of specific month checks. 

Hereâ€™s the breakdown of the program:

1. The function `func_1(month)` creates a set containing the months that have 31 days: `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`.
2. It then checks if the supplied month number is in this set, returning `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

Output hints indicate that while the function does check for the months with 31 days correctly, it does not account for months outside the range of 1 to 12. This could lead to misleading results if the input month is invalid (for example, if the input is 0 or 13, the function would return `False`, which is incorrect behavior since such month values are not expected).

**Potential failures include:**
- Calling `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` would yield `False`, which does not accurately reflect valid month boundaries as defined in the problem description.

Thus, the code does not handle all potential cases as stipulated, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.

Correctness: **False**.
