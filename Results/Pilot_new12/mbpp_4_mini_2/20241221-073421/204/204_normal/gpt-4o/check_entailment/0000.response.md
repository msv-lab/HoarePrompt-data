Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is supposed to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. However, it does not handle invalid inputs, such as month numbers outside the range of 1 to 12 (e.g., month 0, month 13, or month -1). For such cases, it will return `False`, which is incorrect because invalid month numbers should ideally raise an error or return a specific response indicating the input is invalid. 

For example:
- `func_1(0)` returns `False`, but it could be considered invalid as there is no 0th month.
- `func_1(13)` returns `False`, which is incorrect since there is no 13th month.

Thus, since the program fails to account for invalid month inputs, the answer is **False**.
