To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both carefully.

**Problem Description:** 
The function must check whether a given month number (1-12) contains 31 days.

**Annotated Program:**
```python
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
```

**Analysis:**
1. The function `func_1` correctly initializes a set named `months_with_31_days` that contains the months with 31 days: 1 (January), 3 (March), 5 (May), 7 (July), 8 (August), 10 (October), and 12 (December).
   
2. The line `return month in months_with_31_days` checks if the input month is in the set of months that have 31 days. If it is, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. The assertion tests provided before the function definition also cover various month inputs:
   - `func_1(5) == True` checks for May (31 days).
   - `func_1(2) == False` checks for February (not 31 days).
   - `func_1(6) == False` checks for June (not 31 days).
   - `func_1(1) == True` checks for January (31 days).
   - `func_1(12) == True` checks for December (31 days).
   - `func_1(11) == False` checks for November (not 31 days).

4. The program does not handle cases of invalid month numbers (e.g., 0 or 13), but based on the problem description and the assumption that input will be valid (between 1 and 12), this limitation does not affect the correctness for the defined problem.

Based on the above analysis, the program behaves according to the requirements specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
