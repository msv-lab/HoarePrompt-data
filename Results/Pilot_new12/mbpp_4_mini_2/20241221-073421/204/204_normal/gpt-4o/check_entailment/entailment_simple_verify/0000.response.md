Final: **False**

The original assessment accurately identifies that the function `func_1` does not handle inputs outside the valid range for month numbers (1 to 12). While the annotations indicate that the function assumes valid input, this assumption may not always hold true in a practical scenario. The function should ideally validate the input to ensure it is within the expected range. 

If an invalid month number (such as 0 or 13) is provided, the function would return `False`, which is misleading because those inputs do not correspond to any valid month. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem requirements satisfactorily.

This reasoning validates the original assessment of correctness as **False** since it points out a significant limitation that impacts the reliability of the function in real-world usage. Thus, retaining the original assessment is justified.
