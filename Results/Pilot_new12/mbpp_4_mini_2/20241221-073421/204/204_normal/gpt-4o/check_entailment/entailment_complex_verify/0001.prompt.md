You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 31 days or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is intended to check if the given month number contains 31 days. However, it does not handle the case where the input month number is invalid (e.g., months less than 1 or greater than 12). For instance, calling `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` would not raise an error but would return `False`, which does not align with the problem description since those inputs are not valid month numbers. 

Hereâ€™s an example where the program fails:
- `func_1(0)` should ideally handle cases of invalid input gracefully, possibly raising an error or returning an indication that the input is out of range, but it doesn't. Instead, it simply returns `False`, incorrectly suggesting that there's a month 0 with 31 days. 

Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not account for invalid month inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(5) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(6) == False
assert func_1(1) == True
assert func_1(12) == True
assert func_1(11) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive), representing the month number.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
    #The program returns True if month is one of the integers in months_with_31_days, which are 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, or 12; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer parameter `month`, which must be between 1 and 12 (inclusive), representing the month number. It checks if the provided month has 31 days by determining if it is one of the months defined in the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}. The function concludes by returning `True` if the month has 31 days, and `False` otherwise. However, it does not handle cases where the `month` is outside the expected range (1-12), which may lead to misleading results or runtime errors.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
