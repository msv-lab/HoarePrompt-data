Based on the problem description, the goal of the function `func_1` is to determine if a given month number contains 31 days. The program is designed to accept integers from 1 to 12 and returns `True` for those that represent months with 31 days, and `False` for those that do not.

The original assessment stated that the correctness of the function is **False** due to its failure to handle invalid month inputs (e.g., months outside the range of 1 to 12). However, the annotations clarify that the function is expected to operate with valid inputs (as given in the program's assertions). Under this assumption, the annotated code confirms that the function effectively identifies months with 31 days when given valid inputs within the expected range.

The concern raised regarding the handling of invalid inputs does not apply as the context assumes valid month numbers (1 through 12). Therefore, within the provided constraints, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description and passes all the checks indicated by the assertions.

The reason to maintain the original assessment of **False** would only be valid if the function were assumed to handle all possible inputs, including invalid ones. Since the current evaluation considers only valid month numbers as inputs, the function does indeed meet the problem's requirements.

Thus, upon analysis of the provided annotations and the problem description, I conclude that the program operates correctly under the assumed conditions.

Final: **True**
