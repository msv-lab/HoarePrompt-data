Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is intended to check if the given month number contains 31 days. However, it does not handle the case where the input month number is invalid (e.g., months less than 1 or greater than 12). For instance, calling `func_1(0)` or `func_1(13)` would not raise an error but would return `False`, which does not align with the problem description since those inputs are not valid month numbers. 

Hereâ€™s an example where the program fails:
- `func_1(0)` should ideally handle cases of invalid input gracefully, possibly raising an error or returning an indication that the input is out of range, but it doesn't. Instead, it simply returns `False`, incorrectly suggesting that there's a month 0 with 31 days. 

Therefore, the program is not correct as it does not account for invalid month inputs.
