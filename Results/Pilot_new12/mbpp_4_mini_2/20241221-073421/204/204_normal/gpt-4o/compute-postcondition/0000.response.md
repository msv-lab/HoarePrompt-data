The variable `months_with_31_days` is initialized as a set containing the month numbers that have 31 days: `{1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}`. The initial state of the variable `month` (an integer between 1 and 12) remains unchanged since the code only involves initializing a set and not modifying any previously existing variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that `months_with_31_days` has been defined.

Output State: **`month` is an integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive), `months_with_31_days` is {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}**
