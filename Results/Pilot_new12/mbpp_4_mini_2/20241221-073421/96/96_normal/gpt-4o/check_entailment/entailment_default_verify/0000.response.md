Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program function `func_1()` fulfills the problem description requirement to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The validation logic is sound, correctly returning `True` for an empty tuple and accurately determining type consistency for non-empty tuples via the logic described in the assessment. 

The output hints support this assessment, confirming that the function checks for the uniformity of data types in the provided tuple and returns a boolean value accordingly. All provided assertion tests are correctly handled as described, covering integer, string, and mixed-type scenarios, affirming that the function behaves as specified without overlooking necessary edge cases.

Therefore, based on the evidence provided and the coherence of the implementation with the requirements, the final correctness of the program is affirmed as True.
