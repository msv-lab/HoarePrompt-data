Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type as described in the problem statement. The function first addresses the edge case of an empty tuple appropriately by returning `True`. It then sets the type of the first element and validates this type against all subsequent elements in the tuple. 

The annotations confirm the program's behavior at each stage, indicating that the function returns `True` if the tuple is empty or if all its elements match the type of the first element. The test cases provided via assertions further demonstrate that the function operates as expected, handling both homogenous and heterogeneous tuples correctly. 

Since the logic of the function and its handling of the specified conditions is intact and aligns with the original assessment of correctness, the final conclusion is consistent with the original assessment.
