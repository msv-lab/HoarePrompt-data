Explanation: The code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem by checking if all elements in a tuple are of the same data type. It first checks if the tuple is empty, returning True for that case, which is in line with the requirement. Then it establishes the data type of the first element and iterates through the rest of the tuple to ensure they match. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not specifically check for nested tuples, so if the tuple contains different types or a nested tuple, it may not behave as expected. 

For example, the tuple `(5, (1, 2), '4')` would return True, as it compares the top-level types and finds that both integers and tuples are of different types when actually there are mixed types in nested structure, which is likely an undesired outcome per the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
