Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to check whether all elements in a tuple are of the same data type. The function `func_1` is structured correctly: it handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, and it appropriately verifies the types of all elements against the first element. The provided assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected for different cases, ensuring that the implementation meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints elaborate on the function's operation without revealing inconsistencies, further supporting its correctness.
