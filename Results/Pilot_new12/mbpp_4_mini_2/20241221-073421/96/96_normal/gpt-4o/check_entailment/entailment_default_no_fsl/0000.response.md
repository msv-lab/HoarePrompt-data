Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for nested tuples or composite data types. For example, if the input tuple is `((1, 2), (3, 4))`, the function will return `True` since both elements are of type `tuple`, but it does not check the types of the inner elements. This contradicts the problem description, which implies any variation in data types, including nested structures, should result in a return value of `False`. Therefore, there are cases where the program will not work as expected, making it incorrect.
