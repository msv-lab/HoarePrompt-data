Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function `func_1` starts by verifying if the tuple is empty and returns `True` in that case, which aligns with the logical interpretation that all elements in an empty tuple can be considered to have the same data type, as there are no elements to contradict that.

Then, it stores the data type of the first element in `first_type` and iterates through each element in the tuple. If any element has a type that is different from `first_type`, it returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any differing data types, it returns `True`.

The assertions provided as test cases confirm the expected behavior of the function:
- All elements in `(5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)` are integers, so it returns `True`.
- The tuple `(1, 2, '4')` contains an integer and a string, so it returns `False`.
- The tuple `(3, 2, 1, 4, 5)` again consists solely of integers, resulting in `True`.

No edge cases are overlooked, and the logic is robust. Therefore, the function adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.
