Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program fulfills the requirements:

1. The input is a tuple, which is a valid assumption according to the problem description.
2. The function first checks if the tuple is empty. If it is empty, it returns `True`, which is consistent with the requirement that there are no differing types in an empty tuple.
3. Next, the function captures the type of the first element of the tuple for comparison against the types of all other elements.
4. It then iterates over each element in the tuple and compares the type of each element to that of the first element.
5. If any element has a different type, the function returns `False`, indicating not all elements are of the same type.
6. If the loop completes without finding any differing types, the function returns `True`, confirming that all elements in the tuple are of the same type.

Since the program correctly determines whether all elements in the tuple are of the same data type for all potential valid input cases, it meets the requirements set forth in the problem description.
