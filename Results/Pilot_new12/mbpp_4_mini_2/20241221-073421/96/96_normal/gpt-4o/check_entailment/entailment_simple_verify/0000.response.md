Final: **True**

The original assessment that states that the function `func_1()` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type is accurate. 

Here is the reasoning based on the problem description, the program, and the provided annotations:

1. **Problem Description Compliance**: The function is required to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function performs this task appropriately by first checking if the tuple is empty (returning `True` if it is) and then comparing the type of each subsequent element to the type of the first element.

2. **Annotated Code States**:
   - The annotations confirm that when the tuple is empty, it correctly returns `True`, as indicated in the original assessment.
   - The annotation following the `if` block states that if the tuple is non-empty, the function proceeds to compare the types of its elements correctly.
   - The program successfully asserts that all types are the same or returns `False` if a mismatch occurs. The annotation reflects this flow correctly, ensuring that if the loop completes and all types match, it will return `True`.

3. **Test Cases**: The assertion tests provided comprehensively cover:
   - A tuple of integers (returns `True`).
   - A mixed-type tuple (returns `False`).
   - Another tuple of integers (returns `True`).
   This confirms the function's reliability in different scenarios outlined in the original assessment.

Since the function adheres to the problem specification and the annotations accurately describe its behavior, the original assessment is retained as correct. Thus, based on all the evidence provided, the program is indeed correct.

Final: **True**
