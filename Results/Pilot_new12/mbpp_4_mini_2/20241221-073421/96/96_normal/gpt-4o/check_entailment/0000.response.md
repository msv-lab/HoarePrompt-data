Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1()` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. 

Here's how it works:
1. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`, as there are no elements to compare.
2. It stores the type of the first element in `first_type`.
3. It iterates over each element in the tuple and checks its type against `first_type`.
4. If any element has a different type, it returns `False`. 
5. If all elements have the same type, it returns `True`.

The assertion tests provided cover a variety of cases, including:
- A tuple with all integers, which should return `True`.
- A tuple with mixed types (integers and a string), which should return `False`.
- Another tuple with all integers, which correctly returns `True`.

No potential edge cases are overlooked, and the logic correctly meets the problem description requirements.
