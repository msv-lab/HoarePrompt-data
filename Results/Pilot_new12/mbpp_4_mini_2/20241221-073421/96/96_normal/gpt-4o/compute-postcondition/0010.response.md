Postcondition: ***`tup` is a non-empty tuple, `first_type` is the type of the first element of `tup`, and `element` is the second element of `tup`. If `element` is not of the same type as the first element of `tup`, the function returns False. If `element` is of the same type, the function proceeds without a return statement.***
