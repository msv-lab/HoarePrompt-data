According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. The loop iterates over each element in `tup`, and since `tup` is non-empty, there is at least one element in it.

At the end of the last iteration, `element` is the first element in the tuple. For the loop to execute again, `element` must be updated to the next element in `tup`.

Since `element` was the first element in the previous iteration, after that iteration it will now become the second element. Additionally, the loop requires that there are still elements left in the tuple after the current index.

If `element` is currently the first element, we will need to ensure that the tuple has at least two elements to continue the iteration, which it inherently does since it is non-empty.

Therefore, state adjustments for the next iteration will show `element` as the second element in the `tup`.

State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple, `first_type` is the type of the first element of `tup`, `element` is the second element of `tup`.**
