Postcondition: ***`tup` is a non-empty tuple with at least 3 elements, `first_type` is the type of the first element of `tup`, and `element` is the third element of `tup`. If the type of `element` is not the same as `first_type`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no specified return value.***
