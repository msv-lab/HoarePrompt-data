Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements set by the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as an input and checks if all elements within that tuple are of the same data type. 

1. **Set of Types**: The function uses a set comprehension to obtain the types of each element in the tuple. The expression `set(type(x) for x in tup)` constructs a set of unique types based on the elements in the tuple.

2. **Comparison**: It then checks the length of this set. If the length is `1`, it indicates that all the elements are of the same data type (as all types are effectively the same), and thus the function returns `True`. If the length is not `1`, it returns `False`.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The program correctly handles the edge case of an empty tuple. An empty tuple results in an empty set of types, which has a length of `0`. According to the logic established in the program, since there are no differing types, it naturally follows the requirement to return `True`. 

4. **Broad Type Checking**: The program accommodates various data types, including callables and user-defined objects, thus adhering to the problem's specification of checking the data type.

There are no requirements in the problem description that the function needs to handle nested tuples or any additional constraints related to types, making the function's behavior appropriate and complete for the provided requirements.

Overall, the annotated program successfully fulfills the problem description of checking if all the elements in a tuple are of the same data type, making it correct.
