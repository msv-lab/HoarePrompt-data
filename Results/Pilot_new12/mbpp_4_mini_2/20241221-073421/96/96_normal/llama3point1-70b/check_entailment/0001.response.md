Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type by converting the types of the elements into a set and checking if the length of that set is equal to 1. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Functionality**: The `set` data structure only keeps unique elements. Therefore, if all elements in the tuple are of the same type, the set will have only one unique type, resulting in a length of 1.

2. **Handling Different Data Types**: The function correctly handles various data types, including built-in types like integers, floats, strings, and even complex types like lists or dictionaries.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - An empty tuple should return `True` because there are no elements to contradict the statement that all elements are of the same type.
   - A tuple with a single element should also return `True`, as there is no other type present to compare against.

In all examined scenarios, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Since I can't find any case where the program fails to perform the required check, it is correct.
