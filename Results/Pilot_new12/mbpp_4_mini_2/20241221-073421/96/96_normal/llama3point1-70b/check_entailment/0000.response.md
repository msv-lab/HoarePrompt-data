Correctness: **True**.

The function checks if all the elements in the tuple have the same data type by converting each element's type to a set and verifying if the set's length is 1. This means that if the length of the set is 1, all elements share the same data type. It handles tuples that are empty (returns True since there are no differing types) and works for mixed types within tuples. Therefore, it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
