You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple containing elements of any data type.
def func_1(tup):
    return len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all elements in the tuple `tup` are of the same data type, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` which can contain elements of any data type. It evaluates whether all elements in the tuple are of the same data type by converting each element to its type and checking if the number of unique types is one. The function returns `True` if all elements are of the same type, and `False` if they are of different types. Edge cases to consider include an empty tuple, which will also return `True` since there are no differing types. The function does not handle or account for nesting (tuples containing other tuples), which could lead to misunderstood type similarity. If any type, such as a callable (function) or a user-defined class object, is included, it will still be evaluated in the type check, so the checking is broad and accommodates various data type scenarios.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
