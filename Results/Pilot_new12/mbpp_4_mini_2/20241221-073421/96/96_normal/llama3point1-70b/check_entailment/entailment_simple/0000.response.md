Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description, which is to check if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type. 

Hereâ€™s how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a single argument `tup`, which is supposed to be a tuple. According to the problem description, we assume that the input will always be valid, so there is no need for additional checks regarding the type of `tup`.

2. **Logic Implementation**: The program uses a generator expression `type(x) for x in tup`, which iterates over each element `x` in the tuple `tup` and retrieves its type. 

3. **Set and Length Comparison**: By converting this generator expression to a set using `set(...)`, it collects all unique types that were found in the tuple. If the length of this set is `1`, it means all elements in the tuple have the same data type; otherwise, they do not.

4. **Return Value**: The program returns `True` when all types are the same (set length is 1) and `False` otherwise, which aligns perfectly with the requirement specified in the problem description.

Thus, the program successfully determines if all elements in the tuple are of the same data type and behaves correctly under the defined assumptions.
