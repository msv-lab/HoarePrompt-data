Based on the problem description, the function `func_1` is intended to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The function achieves this by using a set to capture the types of each element and checking if the set's length is 1, which would indicate that all elements have the same type.

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function operates as intended and meets the criteria set forth in the problem description. The annotated version reinforces this understanding by specifying that the function returns `True` when all elements in the tuple are of the same data type and `False` otherwise.

In addition, the annotations accurately describe the state before the function call, confirming that the function is designed to work with a tuple containing elements of any data type and is effectively structured to handle both empty and non-empty tuples.

Therefore, the original assessment that the program is correct stands verified. 

Final: **True**
