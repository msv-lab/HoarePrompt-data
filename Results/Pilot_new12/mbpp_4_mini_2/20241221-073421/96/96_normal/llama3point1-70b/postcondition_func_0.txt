The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` which can contain elements of any data type. It evaluates whether all elements in the tuple are of the same data type by converting each element to its type and checking if the number of unique types is one. The function returns `True` if all elements are of the same type, and `False` if they are of different types. Edge cases to consider include an empty tuple, which will also return `True` since there are no differing types. The function does not handle or account for nesting (tuples containing other tuples), which could lead to misunderstood type similarity. If any type, such as a callable (function) or a user-defined class object, is included, it will still be evaluated in the type check, so the checking is broad and accommodates various data type scenarios.
