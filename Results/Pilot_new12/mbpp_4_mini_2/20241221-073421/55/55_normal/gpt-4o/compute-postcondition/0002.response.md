The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `snake_str`. `snake_str` is a string that contains lowercase letters, underscores, and has no leading or trailing underscores. After executing the function body, it returns a string formed by joining the substrings from `components` with each substring capitalized, based on the original `snake_str`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to convert a given snake_case string into a capitalized string by removing underscores and capitalizing the subsequent letters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter snake_str and returns a string formed by joining the substrings from snake_str with each substring capitalized.**
