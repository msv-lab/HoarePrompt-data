You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1('python_program') == 'PythonProgram'
assert func_1('python_language') == 'PythonLanguage'
assert func_1('programming_language') == 'ProgrammingLanguage'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_str is a string that contains lowercase letters, underscores, and no leading or trailing underscores.
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the substrings from `components` with each substring capitalized, based on the original `snake_str` which contains lowercase letters and underscores.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single string parameter `snake_str`, which is expected to contain lowercase letters and underscores without any leading or trailing underscores. The function splits this string into components at every underscore, capitalizes each component, and then joins them together into a new string without any delimiters. The resulting string is returned. Potential edge cases not explicitly covered in the code include handling of an empty string (which would return an empty string) and any strings that only contain underscores or consist solely of underscores (in which case the function would also return an empty string). The code does not handle inputs that do not conform to the specified assumptions (like leading or trailing underscores), but given the assumptions, it is designed to work correctly for valid inputs.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
