The code provided for the problem description performs the task of converting a snake case string to a camel case string by splitting the input string at underscores, capitalizing each component, and joining them together without any delimiters. 

The output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases such as leading or trailing underscores, as well as an empty string. However, per the assumptions made, the function is expected to handle valid inputs without such conditions. Since the problem description explicitly states that the input will contain lowercase letters and underscores without leading or trailing underscores, the function correctly converts the snake case to camel case for the valid cases provided in the assertions.

Following these premises, the function matches the expectations set by the problem description and should correctly process any valid snake_case inputs according to the requirements defined within the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**.
