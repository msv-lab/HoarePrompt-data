Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to handle the case of an empty string correctly. Although the hints indicate that an empty string would return an empty string, this isn't specifically accounted for in the assertions. If we input an empty string into the function `func_1`, it would actually return an empty string as per the split and join logic, because there would be no components to capitalize. 

However, since the assertions provided do not test this edge case, we cannot definitively state that the program accounts for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, since it is possible for the program to return an incorrect outcome or not conform to expected behavior in all cases, it does not meet the criteria for correctness. Additionally, the program does not explicitly handle inputs with leading or trailing underscores, which the problem description states it should avoid. 

Thus, the function is not guaranteed to handle all potential scenarios correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
