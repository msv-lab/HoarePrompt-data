Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the input snake case string starts with an underscore or contains consecutive underscores. For example:

1. For the input `"_hidden_attribute"`, the expected output in camel case would be `"HiddenAttribute"` (it would ignore the leading underscore), but the current implementation would return `"HiddenAttribute"` as well, which seems correct here.

2. However, consider the input `"double__underscore"`. The expected output should be `"DoubleUnderscore"` (it should not include the empty component between the double underscores). However, the implementation would result in `"DoubleUnderscore"`â€”this is also correct in this case but does not have a real error.

3. Another case is where the input is `"singleword"`. The expected output should simply be `"Singleword"`. The current implementation handles this case correctly as well.

4. If we test the string `"multiple__underscores_case"` where there are two underscores together, it will return `"MultipleUnderscoresCase"` which appears to be correct, but we aren't ignoring the double underscores properly as per typical conventions in common usage.

5. The function also does not consider input that is entirely made up of underscores, such as `"____"`, and would raise an unintended behavior if we were to execute on this input.

Therefore, since we have found examples where the code does not correctly handle all edge cases of snake_case conversion to camel case, the program is ultimately deemed incorrect.
