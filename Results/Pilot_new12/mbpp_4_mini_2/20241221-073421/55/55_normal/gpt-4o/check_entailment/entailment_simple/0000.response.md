Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description completely. The problem requirement is to convert a snake case string (e.g., `'python_program'`) into a camel case string (e.g., `'PythonProgram'`). 

The function implementation `func_1(snake_str)` attempts to achieve this by splitting the input string on underscores, capitalizing each component, and then joining them back together. However, it does not handle the case where the first component is expected to be capitalized in camel case, but the rest of the components should also be capitalized.

The function correctly capitalizes all components, but it is implied by the reasoning of "camel case" that the first letter of the first word should be in lowercase (for "lower camel case") or simply that the first letter should be transformed correctly based on standard camel case conventions.

If one considers the standard definition of camel case, it should start with a lowercase letter for the first word. The correct implementation should be:

```python
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return components[0] + ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components[1:])
```

In summary, while the function transforms the input into a string with capitalized components, it does not meet the full requirements of converting to "camel case" as stated in the problem description. Thus, it fails to accurately perform the required transformation for all inputs.
