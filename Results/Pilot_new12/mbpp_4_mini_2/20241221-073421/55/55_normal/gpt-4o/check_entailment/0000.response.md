Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` does not handle the case where the input snake case string starts with an underscore or contains multiple consecutive underscores. For example, if we input `'_python_program'`, the expected output should be `'PythonProgram'`, but the function will output `'PythonProgram'` (removing the initial underscore) and fail to capture the undesired behavior. Additionally, for the input `'python__language'`, the expected output should be `'PythonLanguage'`, but the function will produce `'PythonLanguage'` without correctly addressing the doubled underscore, which should not contribute to a capitalized word.

Thus, the function does not handle these edge cases correctly, leading to the conclusion that it is not correct per the problem description's requirements.
