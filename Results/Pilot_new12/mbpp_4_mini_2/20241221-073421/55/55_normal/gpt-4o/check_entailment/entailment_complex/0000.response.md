Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to convert a snake case string to a camel case string. 

Here is an explanation of why it meets the problem requirements:

1. **Input Assumptions**: The function `func_1` accepts a string that follows the expected format: it contains lowercase letters and underscores without leading or trailing underscores. The program explicitly states this assumption, and it is designed to handle valid inputs according to these constraints.

2. **Splitting the String**: The function splits the input string at each underscore using `snake_str.split('_')`, which effectively breaks the snake case string into its component words.

3. **Capitalizing Components**: Each component (substring) is then capitalized using the expression `x.capitalize()`. This ensures that the first letter of each component will be uppercase while the rest remain lowercase.

4. **Joining Components**: The capitalized components are joined together without any delimiters using `''.join(...)`. This transformation is essential for converting the snake case format into the camel case format.

5. **Correctness Verification**: The assertions provided before the function definition test various cases of valid snake case strings and confirm that the output matches the expected camel case strings. 

The function has been designed under the assumption that inputs will always adhere to the specified format, thus providing correct outputs for all defined test cases, which validates its correctness against the problem description. 

Overall, the program behaves as intended and correctly handles the transformation from snake case to camel case, fulfilling the requirements stated in the problem description.
