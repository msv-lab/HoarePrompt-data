#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_str is a string that contains lowercase letters, underscores, and no leading or trailing underscores.
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components)
    #The program returns a string formed by joining the substrings from `components` with each substring capitalized, based on the original `snake_str` which contains lowercase letters and underscores.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a single string parameter `snake_str`, which is expected to contain lowercase letters and underscores without any leading or trailing underscores. The function splits this string into components at every underscore, capitalizes each component, and then joins them together into a new string without any delimiters. The resulting string is returned. Potential edge cases not explicitly covered in the code include handling of an empty string (which would return an empty string) and any strings that only contain underscores or consist solely of underscores (in which case the function would also return an empty string). The code does not handle inputs that do not conform to the specified assumptions (like leading or trailing underscores), but given the assumptions, it is designed to work correctly for valid inputs.
