The variable `words` is assigned the result of `snake_case_str.split('_')`, which splits the string `snake_case_str` at each underscore, resulting in a list of substrings. The original state of `snake_case_str` remains unchanged. Therefore, `words` will contain a list of the words that were separated by underscores in the original string. 

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, with no leading or trailing underscores; `words` is a list of substrings obtained from splitting `snake_case_str` on underscores.**
