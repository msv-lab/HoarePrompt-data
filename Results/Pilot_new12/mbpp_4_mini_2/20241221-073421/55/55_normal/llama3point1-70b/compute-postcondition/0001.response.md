The string `snake_case_str` is being transformed into `camel_case_str`. Each word in `words` (obtained by splitting `snake_case_str` on underscores) is capitalized and joined together. As a result, `camel_case_str` will be a string where the first letter of each word from `words` is capitalized and concatenated without spaces or underscores.

Since `snake_case_str` consists of lowercase letters and underscores, the output for `camel_case_str` would be in the format where the first letter of each word is capitalized.

Thus, while `snake_case_str` and `words` remain unchanged, the new variable `camel_case_str` holds the camel case representation of the original string.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores; `words` is a list of substrings obtained from splitting `snake_case_str` on underscores; `camel_case_str` is a string in camel case format derived from `snake_case_str`.**
