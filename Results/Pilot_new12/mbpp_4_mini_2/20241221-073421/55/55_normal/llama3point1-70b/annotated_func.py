#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_case_str is a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, with no leading or trailing underscores.
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)
    return camel_case_str
    #The program returns the string 'camel_case_str' which is derived from 'snake_case_str', a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, representing the same content in camel case format.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string parameter `snake_case_str`, which consists of lowercase letters and underscores without leading or trailing underscores. It converts this string into `camel_case_str` format by splitting the input string at underscores, capitalizing the first letter of each resulting word, and joining them together without any additional separators. The function returns this newly formed camel case string. However, the function does not handle edge cases such as empty strings or strings that only consist of underscores, which could result in unexpected outputs or errors in practice. Overall, the function is designed to transform a specific format of string into another standard format but lacks comprehensive handling for all possible input variations.
