Correctness: **True**

The program correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string as required by the problem description. It follows these steps:

1. **Input Handling**: The input parameter `snake_case_str` is treated as a valid string that consists of lowercase letters and underscores, without leading or trailing underscores. 

2. **Splitting the String**: The program uses the `split('_')` method to divide the input string into individual words based on underscores.

3. **Capitalization**: It uses a generator expression to capitalize the first letter of each word derived from the split operation.

4. **Joining Words**: The program then joins these capitalized words together without any additional separators using `''.join()`, which is the essence of converting to camel case.

5. **Output**: Finally, it returns the newly formed string, adhering to the expected camel case format.

Since the problem description specifically mentions that the input will not have leading or trailing underscores and consists of valid lowercase letters, the function performs correctly without errors for such valid inputs.

The function is designed to meet the requirement as it handles the standard snake case format, therefore, it is correct based on the given problem constraints.
