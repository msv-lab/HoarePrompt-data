Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts a snake_case string into a camelCase string, in accordance with the problem description. 

Here's an explanation of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a single string parameter, `snake_case_str`, which follows the specified format of being a string consisting of lowercase letters and underscores, with no leading or trailing underscores. The problem statement assumes valid input, so we can rely on this condition.

2. **String Splitting**: The `split('_')` method is used to break the input string into separate words based on the underscore character. For example, if the input string is `example_snake_case`, it will be split into the list `['example', 'snake', 'case']`.

3. **Capitalization and Joining**: The program employs a list comprehension that capitalizes the first letter of each extracted word using `word.capitalize()`. The `join()` method concatenates these capitalized words without any spaces, effectively transforming it into camel case. For the aforementioned example, the result would be `ExampleSnakeCase`.

4. **Output**: The function returns this newly formatted string, which precisely matches the expectations outlined in the problem description.

In summary, the function performs the required operations to convert snake_case strings to camelCase format correctly and efficiently, adhering to the provided specification in all valid cases.
