You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert a snake case string to camel case string.
Program:
```
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = ''.join((word.capitalize() for word in words))
    return camel_case_str


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It does this by splitting the input string at the underscores and capitalizing the first letter of each subsequent word. The join operation then concatenates these capitalized words together, resulting in a valid camel case string. 

For example, given the input "snake_case_string", the output will be "SnakeCaseString", which meets the requirements of the problem description. Furthermore, it efficiently handles various cases, including single-word inputs like "snake" (resulting in "Snake"), empty strings (resulting in an empty output), and even multiple underscores (resulting in properly formatted words). Since these cases work correctly, the program is verified to be accurate.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string parameter `snake_case_str`, which consists of lowercase letters and underscores without leading or trailing underscores. It converts this string into `camel_case_str` format by splitting the input string at underscores, capitalizing the first letter of each resulting word, and joining them together without any additional separators. The function returns this newly formed camel case string. However, the function does not handle edge cases such as empty strings or strings that only consist of underscores, which could result in unexpected outputs or errors in practice. Overall, the function is designed to transform a specific format of string into another standard format but lacks comprehensive handling for all possible input variations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
