According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If the `nested_list` has at least 3 items, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 2 items, and `flat_list` contains the result of applying `func` to the next item in `nested_list` if it is a list, otherwise, `flat_list` contains the next item from `nested_list`. If the next item is a list, `func` is applied to it and the result is added to `flat_list`. Otherwise, the item is directly appended to `flat_list`. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, the `nested_list` must have at least 3 items. The `flat_list` should contain the result of applying `func` to the next item in `nested_list` if it is a list, or the next item from `nested_list` directly if it is not a list. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 3 items, `flat_list` contains the result of applying `func` to the next item in `nested_list` if it is a list, otherwise `flat_list` contains the next item from `nested_list`.**
