Example Answer:
The `func` function is applied to the `item` from `nested_list`, and the result is added to `flat_list` using the `extend` method. The initial state specifies that `nested_list` contains at least 1 item, so there is an `item` to be processed. The `flat_list` is initially empty, so after executing the code, the result of `func(item)` is added to `flat_list`. 
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 1 item, `flat_list` contains the result of applying `func` to the first item in `nested_list`**
