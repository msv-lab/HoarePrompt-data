Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 2 items. `flat_list` contains the result of applying `func` to the second item in `nested_list` if it is a list, otherwise `flat_list` contains the second item from `nested_list`. In the if part, if the second item in `nested_list` is a list, `func` is applied to it and the result is added to `flat_list`. In the else part, if the second item in `nested_list` is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`. All possible cases are handled, ensuring the correct modification of `flat_list` based on the type of the second item in `nested_list`.***
