According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If the `nested_list` has more items to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 1 item, and `flat_list` contains the result of applying `func` to the first item in `nested_list` if it is a list, otherwise `flat_list` contains the first item from `nested_list`. To execute the loop one more time, the `nested_list` must contain at least 2 items.
State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 2 items, `flat_list` contains the result of applying `func` to the second item in `nested_list` if it is a list, otherwise `flat_list` contains the second item from `nested_list`.**
