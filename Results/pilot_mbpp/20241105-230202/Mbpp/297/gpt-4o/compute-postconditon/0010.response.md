Example Answer:
The `flat_list` is extended with the result of applying `func` to the next item in `nested_list` if it is a list. The `nested_list` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list that contains at least 2 items, `flat_list` contains the result of applying `func` to the next item in `nested_list` if it is a list, otherwise `flat_list` contains the next item from `nested_list`.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 2 items, `flat_list` contains the result of applying `func` to the next item in `nested_list` if it is a list, otherwise `flat_list` contains the next item from `nested_list`**
