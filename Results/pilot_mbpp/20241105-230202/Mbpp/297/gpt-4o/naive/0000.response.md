Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `flatten_list` correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively iterating through each item in the list and checking if it is a list itself. If the item is a list, it calls the function recursively to flatten that sublist. Otherwise, it appends the item to the final flattened list. The function has been tested with multiple test cases and it produces the expected output for all of them. Therefore, based on the given code and the provided test cases, the program is correct.
