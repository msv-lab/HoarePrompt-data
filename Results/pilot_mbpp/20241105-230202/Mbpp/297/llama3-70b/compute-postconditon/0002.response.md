Example Answer:
The function `func` is called with the parameter `element` from `nested_list`, and the returned value is added to `flat_list` using the `extend` method. The values of `nested_list` and `element` are not changed. After execution, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)`. 
Output State: **`nested_list` has at least 1 element, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)`**
