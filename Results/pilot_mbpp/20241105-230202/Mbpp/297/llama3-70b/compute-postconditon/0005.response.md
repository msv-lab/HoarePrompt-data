According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has more elements left, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has at least 1 element, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)` if `element` is a list. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have more than 1 element left, and the `element` changes to the next element in `nested_list`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nested_list` has more than 1 element, `element` is the next element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)` if `element` is a list. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list`**
