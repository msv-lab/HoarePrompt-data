Example Answer:
`element` is appended to `flat_list`, so the new `element` is added to `flat_list`. The states of other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`nested_list` has more than 1 element, `element` is the new next element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)` if `element` is a list; otherwise, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list` with additional elements added by `func(element)` if applicable, and the new `element` is added to `flat_list`**
