Example Answer:
The `element` which is the first element in `nested_list` is appended to `flat_list`. Since `element` is the first element in `nested_list`, it is added to `flat_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` has at least 1 element, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list`.
Output State: **`nested_list` has at least 1 element, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list`**
