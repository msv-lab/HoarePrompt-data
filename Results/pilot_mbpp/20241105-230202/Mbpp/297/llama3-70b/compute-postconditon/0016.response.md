The function `func` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. The precondition is that `nested_list` is a nested list structure where each element can be either a list or a non-list element. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains empty. Otherwise, `flat_list` contains processed elements from `nested_list` based on whether they are lists or non-list elements. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a nested list `nested_list` and process its elements to form a `flat_list` based on whether they are lists or non-list elements. 
Functionality: **If nested_list is empty, flat_list remains empty. Otherwise, flat_list contains processed elements from nested_list based on whether they are lists or non-list elements.**
