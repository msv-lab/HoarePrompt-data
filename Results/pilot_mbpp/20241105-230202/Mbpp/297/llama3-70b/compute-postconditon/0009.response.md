According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in `nested_list`. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` has more than 1 element, `element` is the next element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)` if `element` is a list; otherwise, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list` with additional elements added by `func(element)` if applicable.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `element` should be updated to the next element in `nested_list`.
- If the new `element` is a list, its elements processed by `func` should be added to `flat_list`.
- If the new `element` is not a list, the element itself should be appended to `flat_list`.

State: **`nested_list` has more than 1 element, `element` is the new next element in `nested_list`, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func(element)` if `element` is a list; otherwise, `flat_list` contains the `element` from `nested_list` with additional elements added by `func(element)` if applicable**.
