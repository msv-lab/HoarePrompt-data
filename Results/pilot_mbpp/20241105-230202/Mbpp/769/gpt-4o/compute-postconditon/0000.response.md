Example Answer:
`set1` is assigned the set of elements in `list1`, which means duplicates are removed and the order is not preserved. The values in `list1` are used to create `set1`. The state of `list2` remains unaffected.
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists of elements; set1 is a set created from list1**
