The function `func` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of elements. The function then creates `set1` from `list1` and `set2` from `list2`. It then identifies elements that are present in only one set but not in both, storing them in `diff_elements`. Finally, the function creates `result_list` containing elements from `diff_elements`, sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, which are lists of elements. It then creates sets from the input lists, identifies elements present in only one set but not in both, and returns a list of these elements sorted by their index in the concatenated input lists.**
