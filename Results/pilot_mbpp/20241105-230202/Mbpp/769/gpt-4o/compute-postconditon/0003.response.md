Example Answer:
The `result_list` is assigned the list of elements present in `diff_elements`. The values of `list1`, `list2`, `set1`, and `set2` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `list1` and `list2` are lists of elements; `set1` is a set created from `list1`; `set2` is a set created from `list2`; `diff_elements` contains elements that are in one set but not in both; `result_list` is a list of elements present in `diff_elements`.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of elements; `set1` is a set created from `list1`; `set2` is a set created from `list2`; `diff_elements` contains elements that are in one set but not in both; `result_list` is a list of elements present in `diff_elements`**
