Example Answer: 
The variable `diff_elements` is assigned the result of the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`. The symmetric difference contains elements that are in one of the sets but not in both. The previous values of `set1` and `set2` are unknown, so we cannot determine the specific elements in `diff_elements`. Therefore, the Output State is: list1 and list2 are lists of elements; set1 is a set created from list1; set2 is a set created from list2; diff_elements contains elements that are in one set but not in both.
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists of elements; set1 is a set created from list1; set2 is a set created from list2; diff_elements contains elements that are in one set but not in both**
