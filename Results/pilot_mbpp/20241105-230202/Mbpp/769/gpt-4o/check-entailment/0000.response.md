Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The function is supposed to find the difference between two lists, but it seems to be missing the case where elements are present in both lists. The current implementation only considers elements that are present in one set but not in both. This means that if there are elements common to both lists, they will not be included in the result. The code should be modified to consider all elements that are present in one list but not in the other, including elements that are unique to each list.
