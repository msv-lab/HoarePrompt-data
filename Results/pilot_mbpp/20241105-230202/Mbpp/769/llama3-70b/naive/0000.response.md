Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not correctly calculate the difference between two lists as described in the problem description. The program is using the ^ (xor) operator to find the symmetric difference between two sets created from the input lists, which will not give the correct result for finding the elements that are present in one list but not in both. 

For example, if we have list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4] and list2 = [3, 4, 5], the expected difference should be [1, 2, 5]. However, the program will return [1, 2] as it only calculates the symmetric difference of the sets, not the difference between the lists. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making the correctness **False**.
