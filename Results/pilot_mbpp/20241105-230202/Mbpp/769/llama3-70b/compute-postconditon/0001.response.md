The function `func` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. The function returns a sorted list of elements that are either in `list1` or `list2` but not in both. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list of elements that are unique to either `list1` or `list2`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list of elements that are either in list1 or list2 but not both.**
