Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20', as specified in the problem description. The test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for different input strings. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the function accepts a string input and returns the input string after replacing all spaces with '%20'. Since the code meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
