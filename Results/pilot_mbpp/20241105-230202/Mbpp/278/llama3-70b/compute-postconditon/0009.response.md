According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the tuple `tup`. If there are more elements in `tup`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a tuple containing at least three elements, `elem` is the third element in the tuple and the next element after `elem` is also a tuple. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the `elem` that is the current element should be a tuple, meaning the next element after `elem` should also be a tuple. Hence, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least three elements, the next element after `elem` is also a tuple, `elem` is the fourth element in the tuple**
