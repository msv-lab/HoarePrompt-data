Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple containing at least two elements, the next element after `elem` is also a tuple, and `elem` is the second element in the tuple. If `elem` is a tuple, the function returns the index of `elem` within `tup`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
