Example Answer:
The function returns the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Since `elem` is the second element in the tuple `tup`, its index is 1. Therefore, the output state is: `tup` is a tuple containing at least two elements, the next element after `elem` is also a tuple, and `elem` is the second element in the tuple.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least two elements, the next element after `elem` is also a tuple, and `elem` is the second element in the tuple**
