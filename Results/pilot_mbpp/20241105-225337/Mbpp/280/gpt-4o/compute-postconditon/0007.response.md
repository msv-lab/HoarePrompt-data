Example Answer: 
The function returns True and the value of index which is 2. The values of the variables do not change during the execution of this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in `arr`, `index` is 2, and the function returns True and index.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element in `arr`, `index` is 2, and the function returns True and index**
