Example Answer:
The function returns True and the value of index. The initial index is 0, so the function returns True and index 0. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is: arr is a list of elements with at least 1 element, element is the first element in arr, index is 0.
Output State: **arr is a list of elements with at least 1 element, element is the first element in arr, index is 0**
