Functionality: The function `func` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `element`, which is a single element to be compared within the list. The function searches for the `element` in the `arr`. If the `element` is found in the `arr`, the function returns True along with the index where the element is located. If the `element` is not found in the `arr`, the function returns False. If the `arr` is empty, the function also returns False. If the `element` is not found in a non-empty `arr`, the function should return False.
