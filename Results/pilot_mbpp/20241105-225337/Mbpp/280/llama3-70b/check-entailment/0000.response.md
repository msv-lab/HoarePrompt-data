Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided matches the problem description. The function `sequential_search` iterates through the input array `arr` and checks if the current element is equal to the target element `elem`. If a match is found, it returns a tuple containing True and the index of the element. If no match is found, it returns a tuple containing False and -1. This behavior is consistent with the problem description, making the code correct for all potential cases.
