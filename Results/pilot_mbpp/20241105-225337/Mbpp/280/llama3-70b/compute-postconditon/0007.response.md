Example Answer: 
The code returns `True` and the value of `i` which is 2. The variables `arr` and `elem` are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `elem` is any data type, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in the list `arr`, the function returns True and the value of `i` is 2.
Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `elem` is any data type, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in the list `arr`, the function returns True and the value of `i` is 2**
