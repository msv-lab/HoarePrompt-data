Example Answer:
The function returns `True` and the value of `i`, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `elem` is any data type, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list `arr`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `elem` is any data type, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list `arr`**
