Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a list `arr` and an element `elem`. It iterates through the list `arr` and if it finds an element equal to `elem`, it returns True along with the index of that element. If no such element is found in the list, the function returns False and -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to search for the presence of a specific element in the list and return True with the index if found, or False and -1 if not found.**
