Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function `Find_Max_Length` iterates through each sublist in the `list_of_lists`, calculates the length of each sublist, and stores the maximum length in the variable `max_length`. It then returns this `max_length`. The function handles the case of an empty input list by returning 0, as specified in the problem description.

The test cases provided cover a variety of scenarios including sublists of different lengths and the correct maximum lengths are being returned for each case. The code aligns with the problem description and correctly identifies the length of the longest sublist in the given list of lists.
