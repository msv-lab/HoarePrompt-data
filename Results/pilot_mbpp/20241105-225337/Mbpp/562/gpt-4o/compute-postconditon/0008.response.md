Example Answer:
The length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists` is assigned to `max_length`. The previous value of `max_length` is unknown, but it is guaranteed that `list_of_lists` has at least 3 sublists. Therefore, the maximum length of the first sublist is stored in `max_length`.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `max_length` is the length of the first sublist**
