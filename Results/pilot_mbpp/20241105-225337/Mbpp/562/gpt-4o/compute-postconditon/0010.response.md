According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 4 sublists, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 sublists. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 4 sublists, `max_length` remains unchanged**
