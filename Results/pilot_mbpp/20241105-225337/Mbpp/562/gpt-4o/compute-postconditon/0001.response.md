According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_of_lists. If the list has at least 1 sublist, the loop executes. At the start of the loop, max_length is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list_of_lists must have at least 1 sublist and the sublist is the first sublist in the list.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is 0, `sublist` is the first sublist in the list**
