According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list_of_lists. If there are at least 3 sublists in the list_of_lists, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists. To execute the loop one more time, the list must have at least 3 sublists. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, `max_length` remains unchanged**
