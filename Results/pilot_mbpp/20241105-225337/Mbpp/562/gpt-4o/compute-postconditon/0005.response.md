Example Answer:
`max_length` is assigned the length of `sublist`, which is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. The `max_length` is updated to the length of the second sublist. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is updated to the length of the second sublist, `sublist` is the second sublist in the list.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is updated to the length of the second sublist, `sublist` is the second sublist in the list**
