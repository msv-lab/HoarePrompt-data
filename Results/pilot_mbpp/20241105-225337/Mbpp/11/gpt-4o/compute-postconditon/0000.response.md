Example Answer: 
`first_index` is assigned the value of the first occurrence of character `ch` in string `s` using the `find` method. The `find` method returns -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. Therefore, the possible values of `first_index` are either the index where `ch` is first found or -1 if `ch` is not in `s`. The output state is: **s is a string, ch is a string of length 1, first_index is either the index where ch is first found in s or -1 if ch is not in s**.
Output State: **s is a string, ch is a string of length 1, first_index is either the index where ch is first found in s or -1 if ch is not in s**.
