The function `func` accepts two parameters `s` and `ch`, where `s` is a string and `ch` is a string of length 1. If `first_index` is -1 or `last_index` is -1 or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, then the function returns `s`. Otherwise, it removes the character at the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s` and returns the modified string.
