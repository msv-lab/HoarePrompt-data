Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. For example, if the character `c` is not present in the string `s`, the code should return the original string `s` according to the problem description. However, the current implementation does not handle this case and will return an empty string. This means that the code is incorrect as it does not cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem.
