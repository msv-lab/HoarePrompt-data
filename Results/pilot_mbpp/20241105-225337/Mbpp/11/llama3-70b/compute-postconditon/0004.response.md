Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `c` is a single character. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not equal to -1, the function returns the modified string after removing the substring between the `first_occ` and `last_occ` indexes inclusive. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, the function returns the original string `s`.***
