The function `func` accepts two parameters, `s` and `c`. `s` is a string, and `c` is a single character. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not equal to -1, the function returns the modified string after removing the substring between the `first_occ` and `last_occ` indexes inclusive. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, the function returns the original string `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a string `s` and a single character `c`, and based on the indexes of the first and last occurrences of the character `c`, it either returns the modified string with the substring removed or the original string `s`.
