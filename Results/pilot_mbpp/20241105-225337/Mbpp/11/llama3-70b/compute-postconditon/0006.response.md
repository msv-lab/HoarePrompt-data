Functionality: The function func accepts a string `s` and a single character `c`. If both the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` and the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` are not -1, the function returns the modified string after removing the substring between the first and last occurrences inclusive. If either the index of the first occurrence or the index of the last occurrence of `c` is -1, the function returns the original string `s`.
