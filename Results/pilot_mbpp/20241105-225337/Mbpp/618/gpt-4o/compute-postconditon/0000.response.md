Example Answer: 
The code divides each element in list1 by the corresponding element in list2 using list comprehension and zip function. Since list1 and list2 are lists of numbers with the same length and list2 does not contain any zero elements, division is valid for all pairs. Therefore, the output list will contain the division results.
Output State: **The function returns a new list containing the division of each element in list1 by the corresponding element in list2**
