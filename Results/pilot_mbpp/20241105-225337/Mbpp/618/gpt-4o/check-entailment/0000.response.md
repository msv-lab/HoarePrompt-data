Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code implements the function to divide two lists element-wise as described in the problem description. It takes two input lists `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list containing the division of each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. The code uses list comprehension along with the `zip` function to achieve this. The code does not have any logical errors and handles the division operation correctly. The provided test cases also pass, confirming that the code works as expected for the given inputs. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description, and all potential cases are covered by the code, making it correct.
