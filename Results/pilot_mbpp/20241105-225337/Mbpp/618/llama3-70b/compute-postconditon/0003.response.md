The function `func` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of the same length. After executing the function body, the function does not modify the lists but simply returns the fact that `list1` and `list2` are lists of the same length. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept two lists `list1` and `list2` of the same length and return the fact that they are lists of the same length.
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists list1 and list2 of the same length and returns that they are lists of the same length.**
