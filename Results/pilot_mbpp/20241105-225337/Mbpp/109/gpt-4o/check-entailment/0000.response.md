Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code rotates the binary string `num_rotations` times by moving the last character to the front each time.
- It then converts the rotated binary string to an integer and checks if the integer is odd by using the modulo operator.
- If the integer is odd, it increments the count variable.
- Finally, the function returns the count of odd numbers encountered during the rotations.

The code logic aligns with the problem description, and there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the description that are not handled by the code. Additionally, the provided test cases pass successfully, confirming the correctness of the program.
