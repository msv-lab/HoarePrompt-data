According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `count` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `num_rotations` is greater than 0.
State: **`binary_str` is a binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0**
