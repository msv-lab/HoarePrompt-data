Example Answer: 
The variable `count` is assigned the value of 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0.
Output State: **binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0**
