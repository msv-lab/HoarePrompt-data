Output State: **After the loop executes, `binary_str` is the final rotated binary string, `num_rotations` remains the same, `count` is the number of times the integer value of the rotated binary string is odd, `integer_value` is the decimal representation of the final rotated binary string. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. The function returns the value of `count`.**
