According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the `num_rotations` value. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is the updated rotated binary string, `num_rotations` remains the same, `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the `integer_value` after rotation, and `integer_value` is the decimal representation of `binary_str`. To execute the loop one more time, the `num_rotations` value should be adjusted to ensure the loop runs again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`binary_str` is the updated rotated binary string, `num_rotations` remains the same, `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the `integer_value` after rotation, `integer_value` is the decimal representation of `binary_str`**
