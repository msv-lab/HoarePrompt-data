According to the code, the loop will execute `num_rotations` times. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0. If the `integer_value` after rotation is odd, `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `binary_str` needs to remain as the rotated binary string
- `num_rotations` needs to be greater than 1
- If the `integer_value` after rotation is odd, `count` should be incremented by 1. If it was even, `count` should remain the same.

State: **`binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the `integer_value` after rotation**
