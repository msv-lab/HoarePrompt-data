Example Answer:
The `binary_str` is rotated by moving the last character to the front. The `num_rotations` value is greater than 1, so the rotation will occur multiple times. The `count` variable may or may not be incremented based on the `integer_value` after each rotation. 
Output State: **`binary_str` is the updated rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is the same, `count` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the `integer_value` after rotation**
