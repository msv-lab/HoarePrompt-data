Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The program takes a binary string `s` and an integer `n` as input. It then rotates the binary string `s` `n` number of times and counts the number of numbers with an odd value ('1') in each rotation.

The program correctly handles the case where the input string `s` is rotated `n` number of times by concatenating the string `s` with itself (`s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)`). This ensures that we have enough characters to perform the rotations.

The program then iterates through each rotation of the string and counts the number of '1's. If the count is odd, it increments the `count` variable.

Overall, the logic of the program is correct and it follows the problem description accurately.
