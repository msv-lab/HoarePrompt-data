Example Answer:
The binary string `s` is repeated multiple times to match the length of the string to be at least `n`. The value of `n` indicates how many times the string `s` needs to be repeated. Therefore, the output state is `s` is a binary string, `n` is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is a non-negative integer**
