Example Answer:
The variable `temp` is assigned the substring of `s` starting from index `i` to the end of the string. The initial value of `s` is a binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, and `i` is 0. After executing the code, `temp` will hold the value of the entire `s` string since `i` is 0 and the slice goes from index 0 to the end of the string. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is the entire `s` string.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is the entire `s` string**
