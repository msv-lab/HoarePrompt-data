Example Answer: 
`count` is incremented by the count of '1's in the `temp` string modulo 2. The value of `temp` is the entire `s` string, so the count of '1's in `temp` is calculated and then taken modulo 2. The previous values of `s`, `n`, `i` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the count of '1's in `temp` string modulo 2, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the count of '1' in `temp` string modulo 2, `i` is 0**
