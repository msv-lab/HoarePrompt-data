Example Answer: 
The value of `temp` is a substring of `s` starting from index 1 till the end of `s`. The count of '1' in `temp` is calculated and then modulo 2 is taken. This value is added to the current value of `count`. The values of `s`, `n`, `i` are unaffected. 
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is updated based on the count of '1' in `temp` string modulo 2, `i` is 2, `temp` is a substring of `s` starting from index 1 and ending at the length of `s`**
