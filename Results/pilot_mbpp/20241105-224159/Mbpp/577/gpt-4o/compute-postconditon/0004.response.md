Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is greater than or equal to 5, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of n and returns the last digit of the calculated factorial (factorial % 10). If n is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of n correctly but doesn't return the last digit as indicated in the annotations. Hence, the code does not fully align with the annotations provided.**
