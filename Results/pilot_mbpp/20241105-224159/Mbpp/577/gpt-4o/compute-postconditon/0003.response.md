The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, if n is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If n is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of n and returns the last digit of the calculated factorial (factorial % 10). Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a non-negative integer `n`, return 0 if n is greater than or equal to 5, or return the last digit of the factorial of n if n is less than 5.
Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is greater than or equal to 5, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of n and returns the last digit of the calculated factorial (factorial % 10).**
