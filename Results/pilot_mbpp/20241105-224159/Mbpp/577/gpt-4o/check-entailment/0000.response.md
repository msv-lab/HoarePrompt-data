Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully align with the problem description. The function is supposed to calculate the factorial of the given number and return the last digit of the calculated factorial. However, the code only returns 0 if the input number is greater than or equal to 5, which is not the correct behavior. For example, when `n = 30`, the function should return 0 as the last digit of 30! is 0, but the code incorrectly returns 0 for any input greater than or equal to 5.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description.
