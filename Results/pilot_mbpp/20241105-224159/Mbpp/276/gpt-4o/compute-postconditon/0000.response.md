Example Answer:
The variable `volume` is calculated by multiplying pi, the square of `radius`, and `height`. The values of `radius` and `height` are non-negative floating-point numbers. Therefore, the resulting `volume` will be a floating-point number. 
Output State: **`volume` is the calculated volume based on the given formula with non-negative radius and height**
