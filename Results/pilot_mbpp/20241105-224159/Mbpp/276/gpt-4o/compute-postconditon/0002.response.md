The function `func` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative floating-point numbers. The function calculates the volume based on a specific formula using the provided `radius` and `height` values. The calculated volume is then returned as the output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept non-negative floating-point numbers `radius` and `height`, calculate the volume based on a specific formula, and return the calculated volume.
