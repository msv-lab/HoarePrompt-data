Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `volume_cylinder` accepts two non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius^2 * height`, and returns the result. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it is working correctly.
