According to the code, the loop can execute if `num` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is n-1, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. So for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, `num` should be n and `n` should remain greater than or equal to 3.
State: **`count` is 1, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3**
