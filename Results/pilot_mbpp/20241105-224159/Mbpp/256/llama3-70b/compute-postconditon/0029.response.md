The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. The function also uses a local variable `count`, which is an integer starting at 0. The function then checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If `n` is greater than 2, the loop will execute at least once, iterating through the range [2, n) and calling `func2(num)` for each iteration. If `func2(num)` evaluates to true, `count` is increased by 1. After the loop, `count` represents the number of times `func2(num)` returned true in the given range. If n is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0. The function then returns the final value of `count`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`. It initializes a counter `count` to 0 and checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 3. If true, it iterates through the range [2, n) calling `func2(num)` and increments `count` for each true evaluation. It returns the final value of `count`, representing the number of times `func2(num)` returned true in the given range. If n is less than or equal to 2, it returns 0.**
