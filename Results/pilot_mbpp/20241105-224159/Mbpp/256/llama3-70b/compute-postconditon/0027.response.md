Output State: **`count` is an integer starting at 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. The loop will execute at least once if n is greater than 2. If `func2(num)` evaluates to true, `count` is increased by 1 for each iteration where num is in the range [2, n). After the loop, `count` represents the number of times `func2(num)` returned true in the given range. If n is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.**
