According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is 2 or greater, and `i` is 4. Since `num` being 2 or greater does not ensure that the loop will execute again, the variable `num` needs to be adjusted to `num` is greater than 16 (since 4^2=16). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `num` is greater than 16, `i` is 4**
