The function `func` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a non-negative integer. 

Case_1: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.

Case_2: If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the state of the variables. If `num` is 2 or greater, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration, and if `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `n`, `num`, and `i`.

Case_3: If `num` is less than 2, no change in state. If `num` is 2 or greater, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration. The function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and return False if `num` is less than 2 or divisible by `i` (where `i` is the next integer after the previous iteration), otherwise it returns True.
