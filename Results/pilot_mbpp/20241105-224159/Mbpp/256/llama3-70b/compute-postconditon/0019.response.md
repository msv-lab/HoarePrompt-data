Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer starting at 0, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3. If func2(num) evaluates to true, `count` is increased by 1. Thus, after the execution of the if block, `count` becomes 1 and `n` remains greater than or equal to 3. No changes occur to `n` as a result of the if statement.***
