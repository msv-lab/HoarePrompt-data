Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to count the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. It initializes a list to keep track of prime status for each number up to n-1, marks 0 and 1 as not prime, then iterates through the numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers. Finally, it sums the prime numbers less than n and returns the result.

The program has been tested with multiple test cases, and it produces the expected output for each case. The algorithm used in the program is a well-known and efficient method for counting prime numbers, ensuring the correctness of the program.
