Postcondition: ***`n` is 3 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 3. If `is_prime[i]` is True, the loop sets all elements in the `is_prime` list to False where the index is a multiple of `i` starting from `i*i` up to `n`. If `n` is less than `i*i`, the loop does not execute. Any elements in the `is_prime` list that were already False remain unchanged.***
