According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n + i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are False, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is False. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `n + i + i` to satisfy the loop condition. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n + i + i`, `is_prime[j]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False**
