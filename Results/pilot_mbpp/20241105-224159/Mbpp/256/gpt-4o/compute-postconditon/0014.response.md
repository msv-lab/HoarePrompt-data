According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n` (int(n ** 0.5) + 1). At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 3 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then after the loop executes, all indices in the `is_prime` list that are multiples of `i` from `i * i` to `n - 1` will be set to False. If `i * i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer after 2, which is 3, and `is_prime[3]` needs to be True to satisfy the condition for the loop to continue.
State: **`n` is 3 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 3**
