According to the code, the loop will execute if `i * i` is less than `n`. So, for the loop to execute, `i * i` must be less than `n`. Before the loop starts, `i` is 3, so the minimum value of `n` for the loop to execute is 9. Additionally, `is_prime` values for 0 and 1 need not be adjusted for the loop to execute.
State: **`n` is 9 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 3**
