According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is within the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step size of `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 10 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 3, and all `is_prime[j]` where `j` is any value becomes False. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `j` needs to be adjusted. Since `i` is 3, `j` should be in the range of 9 to n with a step size of 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following state should be adjusted:
State: **`n` is 10 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 3, all `is_prime[j]` where `j` is any value becomes False, `j` is in the range of 9 to n with a step size of 3**
