According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is 3 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `i` is 4. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to increment `i` by 1 and update `is_prime` list for non-prime numbers within the range of `i * i` and `n`.
State: **`n` is 3 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `i` is 5, update `is_prime` list for non-prime numbers within the range of `i * i` and `n`**
