Example Answer:
The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to False. The value of `j` is not specified in the code snippet, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `is_prime[j]`. However, since `j` is not provided and `j` is related to the concept of prime numbers, we can assume `j` to be a non-prime number. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 16, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 4, and a non-prime `j` is set to False.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 16, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 4, and a non-prime `j` is set to False**
