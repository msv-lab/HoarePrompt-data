According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `j`. In order for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than `i * i` and `i` must be less than `n`. Before the loop starts, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` values are irrelevant for the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than `i * i`, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is equal to `i * i`.
State: **`n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `i * i`**
