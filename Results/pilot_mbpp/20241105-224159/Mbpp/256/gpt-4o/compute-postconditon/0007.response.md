According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i * i`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `i * i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`, i.e., `j < n`. Since `j` is currently equal to `i * i`, it needs to be adjusted to `j` less than `n` after incrementing by `i`. Additionally, the value of `is_prime[j]` is not given, so no adjustment is needed for that state.
State: **`n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n`, `is_prime[j]` is False**
