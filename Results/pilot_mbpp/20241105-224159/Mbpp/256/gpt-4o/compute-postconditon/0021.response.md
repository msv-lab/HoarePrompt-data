According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 10 or greater, `i` is 3, and all `is_prime[j]` where `j` is in the range of 9 to n with a step size of 3 are False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`, therefore `j` should be updated to the next value in the range of 9 to n with a step size of 3 from the current value of 9.
State: **`n` is 10 or greater, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 3, all `is_prime[j]` where `j` is any value becomes False, `j` is in the range of 12 to n with a step size of 3**
