According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is within the range of `i * i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 16, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 4, and a non-prime `j` is set to the next non-prime number within the range of `i * i` and `n`.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the value of `j` to the next non-prime number within the range of `i * i` and `n`, and update `is_prime[j]` to False for that non-prime number `j`.

State: **`n` is greater than 16, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `i` is 4, a non-prime `j` is set to the next non-prime number within the range of `i * i` and `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
