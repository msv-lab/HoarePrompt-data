Example Answer:
The list `is_prime` is created with `n` elements, and all elements are initialized to `True`. The length of the list is based on the value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0.**
