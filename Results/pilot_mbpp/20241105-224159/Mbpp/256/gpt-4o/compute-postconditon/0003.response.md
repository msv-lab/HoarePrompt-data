Example Answer:
`is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are assigned the value `False`. There are no other changes to the initial state, so the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0; `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0; `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False**
