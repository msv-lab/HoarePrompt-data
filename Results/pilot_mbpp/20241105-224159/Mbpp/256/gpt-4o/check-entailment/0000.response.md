Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the scenario where `n` is negative as mentioned in the problem description. The function `count_Primes_nums` correctly identifies prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`, but it fails to account for negative values of `n`, which is a potential case not covered by the program.
