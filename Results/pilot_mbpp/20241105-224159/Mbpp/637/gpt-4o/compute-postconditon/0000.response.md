Example Answer:
The code checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price and returns a boolean value. The values of cost_price and selling_price are not provided in the initial state, so the comparison result is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: cost_price and selling_price are integers representing the cost price and selling price respectively.
Output State: **cost_price and selling_price are integers representing the cost price and selling price respectively**
