Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The given program defines a function `noprofit_noloss` that simply checks if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`. The function returns `True` if there is no profit and no loss (cost_price == selling_price), and `False` otherwise. 

All the provided test cases pass as expected:
1. `noprofit_noloss(1500, 1200) == False` - There is a loss as the selling price is less than the cost price.
2. `noprofit_noloss(100, 100) == True` - The cost price is equal to the selling price, hence no profit or loss.
3. `noprofit_noloss(2000, 5000) == False` - There is a profit as the selling price is greater than the cost price.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and passes all the test cases, the correctness is True.
