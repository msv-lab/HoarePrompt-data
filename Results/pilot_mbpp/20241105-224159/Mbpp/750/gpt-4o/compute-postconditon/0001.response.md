The function `func` accepts two parameters, `lst` which is a list and `tpl` which is a tuple. After executing the function body, the function returns the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl` as a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return the concatenation of both as a list.
