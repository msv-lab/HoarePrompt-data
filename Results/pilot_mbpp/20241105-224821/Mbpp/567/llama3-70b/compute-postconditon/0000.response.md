Example Answer: 
The function returns a boolean value indicating whether all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order. If the condition `lst[i] <= lst[i + 1]` holds for all pairs of adjacent elements in the list, then the function returns True. If the condition does not hold for any pair of adjacent elements, the function returns False. The state of the list `lst` remains unchanged.
Output State: **lst is a list of elements, and the function returns True or False based on whether the elements are in non-decreasing order or not**
