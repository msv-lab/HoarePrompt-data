Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one to ensure that the list is in non-decreasing order. The use of `all` function ensures that the condition holds true for all elements in the list except for the last one which is checked with `<=` operator. Since the logic aligns with the problem description and there are no potential cases where the program fails to work as expected, the correctness is true.
