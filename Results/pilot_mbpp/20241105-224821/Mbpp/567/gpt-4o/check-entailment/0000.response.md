Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not fully follow the problem description. The function `issort_list` iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If at any point an element is greater than the one following it, the function returns False. However, the problem description states that the function should return False if any element is greater than the one following it, which means it should only check for strictly increasing order. The code does not handle the case where two adjacent elements are equal, which would still make the list unsorted. Therefore, the code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
