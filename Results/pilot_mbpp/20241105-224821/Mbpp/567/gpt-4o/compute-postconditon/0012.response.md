The function `func` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. 

Case_1: If `lst` is a list with at least 2 comparable elements, the function iterates through the list, comparing each element with the next. If at any point an element is greater than the one following it, the function returns False. If no such condition is met, the function continues to the end of the list. If `lst` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and the function returns True.

Case_2: The function always returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list `lst` of comparable elements and return False if any element in the list is greater than the one following it. If the list has less than 2 elements or all elements are in order, the function returns True.
