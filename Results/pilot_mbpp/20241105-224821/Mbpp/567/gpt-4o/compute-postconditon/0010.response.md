Output State: **If lst is a list with at least 2 comparable elements, the loop will iterate through the list comparing each element with the next. If at any point an element is greater than the one following it, the function returns False. If no such condition is met, the function continues to the end of the list. If lst has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and the function returns True.**
