Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The given Python function `all_Characters_Same` correctly checks whether all the characters in the input string are the same or not. It first handles the edge case where the string is empty by returning True, which is in line with the problem description. Then, it initializes the `first_char` variable to the first character of the string and iterates through each character in the string. If any character is found to be different from the `first_char`, it returns False immediately. Otherwise, if all characters are the same, it returns True. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the program.
