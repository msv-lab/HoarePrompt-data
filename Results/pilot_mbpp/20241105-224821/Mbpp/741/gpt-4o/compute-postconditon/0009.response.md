According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the second to last character in `s`. If `char` is not equal to the first character of `s`, the function returns False. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state such that `char` becomes the last character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the last character in `s`**
