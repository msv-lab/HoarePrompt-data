According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the last character in `s`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the `char` variable should not be equal to the last character in `s`, so it needs to be adjusted to the character before the last character in `s`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the second to last character in `s`**
