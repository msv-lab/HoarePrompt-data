The function `func` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. 

Case 1: If `s` is empty, the function returns True.

Case 2: If `s` is a non-empty string and all characters in `s` are equal to the first character in `s`, the function returns True. If any character in `s` is different from the first character, the function returns False.

Case 3: The function always returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a string `s` and return True under the specified conditions in Cases 1, 2, and 3.
