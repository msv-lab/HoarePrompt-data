Example Answer:
The function returns `False`, and the initial state states that `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in `s`, and the function returns True. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in `s`, and the function returns False.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in `s`, and the function returns False**
