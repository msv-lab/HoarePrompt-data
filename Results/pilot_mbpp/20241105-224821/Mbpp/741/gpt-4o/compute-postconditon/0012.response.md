According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, and `char` is the last character in `s`. To execute the loop one more time, the string `s` should still have more characters left after the last character, and the `char` variable should be updated to the next character in the string.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with more characters left, `char` is the next character after the last character in `s`.**
