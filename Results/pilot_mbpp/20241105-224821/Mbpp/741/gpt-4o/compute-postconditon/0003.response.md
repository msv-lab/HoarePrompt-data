According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` has at least 1 character, the loop will execute. Since the function returns True, it does not have a direct impact on the loop execution. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `s` is not an empty string and `char` is the first character in the string.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in `s`, the function returns True**
