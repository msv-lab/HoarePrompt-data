Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description. The function checks if all characters in the input string `s` are the same. If the string is empty, it returns True. If the string is non-empty, it compares each character with the first character and returns False if any character is different. Otherwise, it returns True. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for various scenarios.
