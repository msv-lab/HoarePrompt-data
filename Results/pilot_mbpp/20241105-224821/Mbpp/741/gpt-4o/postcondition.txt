The function `func` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. If `s` is empty, the function returns True. If `s` is a non-empty string and all characters in `s` are equal to the first character in `s`, the function returns True. If any character in `s` is different from the first character, the function returns False. The function always returns True.
