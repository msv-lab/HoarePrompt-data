The function `func` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. 

- `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing student names and values are tuples of two floats representing student height and weight.
- `min_height` is a float representing the minimum height a student must have to be included in the filtered dictionary.
- `min_weight` is a float representing the minimum weight a student must have to be included in the filtered dictionary.

After executing the function body, the function returns a filtered dictionary based on the conditions that the student's height must be greater than or equal to `min_height` and the student's weight must be greater than or equal to `min_weight`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a dictionary `student_dict`, a minimum height `min_height`, and a minimum weight `min_weight`, and return a filtered dictionary containing only the students who meet the height and weight criteria.
