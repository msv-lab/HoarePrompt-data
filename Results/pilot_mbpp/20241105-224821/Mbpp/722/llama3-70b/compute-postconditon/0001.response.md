The function `func` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. 

**Precondition**: `student_data` is a dictionary where keys are strings (student names) and values are tuples of two floats (student_height, student_weight). `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively.

After executing the function body, the function will return a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to filter out and return a dictionary of students based on the minimum height and weight criteria provided.
