Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly checks if the given tuple has any `None` value or not. It iterates through each item in the tuple and if it encounters a `None` value, it returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The test cases provided cover scenarios where the tuple contains `None` values and where it does not, and the program correctly identifies them in each case. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
