According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `nums` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `count` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element and `i` is 0.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
