Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is equal to the new value of `i + 1. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then `count` is increased by 1. The postcondition encapsulates the scenario where the XOR of elements at positions `i` and `j` is even, leading to an increment in the value of `count`.***
