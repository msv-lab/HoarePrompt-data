According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `nums`. If `nums` has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `count` has been updated for even XOR pairs does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` has been updated for even XOR pairs, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is equal to `i + 1.
State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` has been updated for even XOR pairs, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1**.
