According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is equal to the new value of `i + 1. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then `count` is increased by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the new `j` value (i + 1) is less than the length of `nums`. Additionally, since `i` has been incremented by 1, the new `j` value should be incremented as well. If the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, then the count should be increased by 1.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the new value of `i + 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`, XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, count is increased by 1**
