Based on the given for loop statement, the loop can only execute if `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, meaning there are at least 2 elements in `nums`. Additionally, `j` should be initialized to `i + 1` for the loop to iterate correctly.

Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` is updated based on XOR operations, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is initialized to `i + 1`**
