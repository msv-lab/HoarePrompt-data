Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. The value of `count` is updated based on XOR operations, but the previous value is unknown. `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is incremented by 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` is updated based on XOR operations, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is incremented by 2.
Output State: **`nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` is updated based on XOR operations, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is incremented by 2**
