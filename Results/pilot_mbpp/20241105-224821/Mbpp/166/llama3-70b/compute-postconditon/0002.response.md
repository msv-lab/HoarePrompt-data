According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `nums` has at least 2 elements. The loop starts at index `i + 1`, so to execute the loop, the index `i` must be less than the length of `nums` minus 1. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` should be less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` should be equal to `i + 1`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, `i` is less than length of `nums` - 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1**.
