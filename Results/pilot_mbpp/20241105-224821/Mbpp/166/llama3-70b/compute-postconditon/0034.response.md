Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 3 elements. If the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, `count` is increased by 1. `i` is still less than the length of `nums` minus 1, and `j` is incremented by 2. This holds true for all possible combinations of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, covering edge cases where the XOR operation could potentially lead to an odd number as well.***
