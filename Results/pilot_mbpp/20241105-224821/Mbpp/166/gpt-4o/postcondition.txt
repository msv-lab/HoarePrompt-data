The function func accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers. It calculates the count of even numbers in the list as even_count, the count of odd numbers as odd_count, and odd_pairs accordingly. It then returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or if the list contains non-integer values.
