Example Answer:
The value of `even_pairs` is calculated by multiplying `even_count` by `even_count - 1` and then dividing the result by 2. The values of `even_count` and `odd_count` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate the exact value of `even_pairs`. Therefore, the output state is: lst is a list of integers, even_count holds the count of even numbers in the list, odd_count is the difference between the length of lst and even_count.
Output State: **lst is a list of integers, even_count holds the count of even numbers in the list, odd_count is the difference between the length of lst and even_count**
