Example Answer:
`odd_count` is assigned the value of the length of `lst` minus the value of `even_count`. The values of `lst` and `even_count` are not specified, so the output state is: lst is a list of integers, even_count holds the count of even numbers in the list, and odd_count is the difference between the length of lst and even_count.
Output State: **lst is a list of integers, even_count holds the count of even numbers in the list, odd_count is the difference between the length of lst and even_count**
