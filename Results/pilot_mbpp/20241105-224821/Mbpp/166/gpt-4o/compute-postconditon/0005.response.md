The function `func` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. The function then calculates the count of even numbers in the list as `even_count`, calculates the count of odd numbers in the list as `odd_count` (which is the difference between the length of `lst` and `even_count`), and calculates `odd_pairs` accordingly. Finally, the function returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of integers and return the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs based on the input list.
