Example Answer:
`even_count` is assigned the sum of 1 for each element `x` in the list `lst` if `x` is even (divisible by 2). The initial state of `lst` is a list of integers. After running the code, `even_count` will hold the count of even numbers in the list `lst`. 
Output State: **lst is a list of integers, even_count holds the count of even numbers in the list**
