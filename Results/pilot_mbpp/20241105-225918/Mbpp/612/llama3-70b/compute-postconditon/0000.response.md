Example Answer:
The code returns a list where the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists` is extracted into a new list, and another list is created with the second elements of each sublist. Since the `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, the code will extract the first and second elements from each sublist respectively.

Output State: **Two new lists are returned, the first list contains the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
