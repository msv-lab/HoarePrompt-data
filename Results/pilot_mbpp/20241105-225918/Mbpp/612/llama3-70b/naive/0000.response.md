Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program is supposed to take a list of lists where each sublist has two elements, and return a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. 

However, the program is using list comprehension incorrectly. The correct implementation should be as follows:

```python
def merge(list_of_lists):
    return [ [element[0] for element in list_of_lists], [element[1] for element in list_of_lists] ]
```

This correction ensures that the program returns the desired output as described in the problem statement.
