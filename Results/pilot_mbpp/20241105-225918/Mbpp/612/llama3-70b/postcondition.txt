The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists with exactly two elements in each sublist. It then returns two new lists: one containing the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the other containing the second elements of each sublist. The code does not handle cases where the input `list_of_lists` is empty or contains sublists with fewer or more than two elements.
