Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to correctly follow the problem description. The function `merge` takes a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements, and returns two new lists: one containing the first elements of each sublist and the other containing the second elements of each sublist. The code does not handle cases where the input list_of_lists is empty or contains sublists with fewer or more than two elements, but this is not specified in the problem description. Therefore, based on the given problem description, the code meets the requirements.
