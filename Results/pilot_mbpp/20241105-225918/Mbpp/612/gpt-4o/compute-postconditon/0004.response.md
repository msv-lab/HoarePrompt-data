Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, extracts the first elements of each sublist into first_elements, and the second elements of each sublist into second_elements. It then returns a list containing first_elements and second_elements. The function assumes that list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements.**
