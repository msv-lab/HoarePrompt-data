The function `func` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, the function returns `first_elements`, which is a list containing the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `second_elements`, which is a list containing the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a list of lists `list_of_lists`, and return two lists `first_elements` and `second_elements` containing the respective elements of each sublist. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns first_elements with the first elements of each sublist, and second_elements with the second elements of each sublist.**
