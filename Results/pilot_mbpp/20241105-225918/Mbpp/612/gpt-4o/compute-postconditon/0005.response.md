Example Answer: 
The function does not affect any variables in the initial state. It just prints 'All test cases passed!'. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
Output State: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, extracts the first elements of each sublist into first_elements, and the second elements of each sublist into second_elements. It then returns a list containing first_elements and second_elements. The function assumes that list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements.**
