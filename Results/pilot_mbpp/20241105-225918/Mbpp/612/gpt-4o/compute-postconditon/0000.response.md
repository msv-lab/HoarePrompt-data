Example Answer:
The code extracts the first element of each sublist in list_of_lists and assigns them to the variable first_elements. Since the initial state specifies that each sublist contains exactly two elements, the first_elements list will contain all the first elements of each sublist. 
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements is a list containing the first elements of each sublist**
