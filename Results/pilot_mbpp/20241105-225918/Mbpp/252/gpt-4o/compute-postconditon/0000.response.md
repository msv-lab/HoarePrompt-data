Example Answer: 
The function returns the polar coordinates (magnitude, phase) of the complex number `num`. Since the initial state specifies that `num` is a complex number, the function `cmath.polar(complex(num))` will return the polar coordinates of that complex number. There is no change in the state of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: num is a complex number and the function returns the polar coordinates of `num`.
Output State: **num is a complex number and the function returns the polar coordinates of `num`**
