Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts complex numbers to polar coordinates as per the problem description. The `abs()` function is used to calculate the magnitude (absolute value) of the complex number, and `cmath.phase()` is used to calculate the phase angle of the complex number. The program covers all potential cases and works correctly for all inputs, therefore the correctness is True.
