Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function called `maximum` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the maximum value between them using the `max` function in Python. The function follows the problem description as it correctly returns the maximum of the two input numbers. There are no edge cases where the code might fail to find the maximum value between two numbers. The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the code is correct.
