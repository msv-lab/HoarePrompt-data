Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes a string as input and returns a new string with only the uppercase characters from the original string. The program uses list comprehension to iterate through each character in the input string and only includes the character if it is uppercase. The program then joins these characters together to form the final string.

The program has been tested with multiple test cases and it correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the given string. Therefore, based on the provided program code and the test cases, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
