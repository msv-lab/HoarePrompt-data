Example Answer: 
The function returns the count of occurrences of `element` in the `tup` tuple. The value of `tup` and `element` are not specified in the initial state, so the output state will be: `tup` is a tuple and `element` is any data type, and the function returns the count of `element` in `tup`.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple and `element` is any data type, and the function returns the count of `element` in `tup`**
