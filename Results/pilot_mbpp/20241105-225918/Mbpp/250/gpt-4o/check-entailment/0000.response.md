Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code accurately follows the problem description. The function `count_X` takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and returns the count of `element` in `tup`. The code uses the built-in `count` method of tuples which accurately calculates the count of `element` in `tup` for all data types of `element` within the tuple. All the provided test cases pass successfully, indicating that the code is correct.
