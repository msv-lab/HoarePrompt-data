Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `count_X` that takes in a tuple and an element, and then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The function is correctly implemented and works as expected for all potential cases. The test cases provided cover various scenarios and the program produces the correct output for each of them. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
