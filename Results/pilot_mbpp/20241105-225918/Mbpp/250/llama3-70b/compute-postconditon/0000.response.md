Example Answer: 
The function `count()` is used to count the number of times `elem` appears in the tuple `tup`. The function returns this count. The initial state does not change during this process. Therefore, the Output State is: tup is a tuple and elem is an element that can be found in tup, and the function returns the count of `elem` in `tup`.
Output State: **tup is a tuple and elem is an element that can be found in tup, and the function returns the count of elem in tup**
