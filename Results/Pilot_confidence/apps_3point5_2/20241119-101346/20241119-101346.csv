Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and the details of each bus route.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the waiting time for each bus route based on the given time and the arrival times of the buses.
3. The program then determines the chosen route based on the minimum waiting time calculated for each route.
4. The output is the chosen route which aligns with the problem description.
5. The program iterates through all bus routes and correctly handles cases where the first bus of a route arrives after Serval goes to the station.
6. The program also considers cases where the interval between buses is such that Serval will have to wait for a specific amount of time.
7. The program covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.",True,,pilot_apps4.json

2. The program defines two functions, func_1 to calculate the greatest common divisor of a list of numbers and func_2 to find all divisors of a given number.

4. It then finds all the divisors of the sum of A and iterates through them to check if each divisor can divide every element of A after the operations.
