Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if all the remainders are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and exits with "No" if a duplicate remainder is found. Otherwise, it prints "Yes" indicating that all remainders are distinct. The logic in the code is sound and covers all potential cases.
