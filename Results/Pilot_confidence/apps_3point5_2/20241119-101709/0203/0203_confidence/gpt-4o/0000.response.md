Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem statement. It keeps track of the indices of employees from both fractions in separate queues and then iterates through the queues, denying the right to vote to the employee with the lower index until only one queue is left. The output is then determined based on which queue is non-empty at the end. The code handles all possible cases and follows the rules of the voting procedure accurately.
