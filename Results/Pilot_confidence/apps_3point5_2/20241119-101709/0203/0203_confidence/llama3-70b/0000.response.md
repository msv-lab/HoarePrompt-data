Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the number of depublicans and remocrats and then prints the outcome based on which fraction has more members. The logic follows the problem description accurately, and for every potential case, the program should work as expected. The example scenarios provided in the problem description also align with the logic implemented in the code. Therefore, I am confident that the program is correct.
