Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to find characters that are present in `t`, and finally appends `t` to the end of the constructed string `n`. The logic of the program seems to be correct as it correctly reconstructs the smallest possible integer `n` based on the provided substring `t`. The program handles the case where there may be more than one way to restore the number `n` by constructing the smallest possible integer. The program also accounts for the scenario where the integer `n` itself is zero and handles leading zeroes appropriately. Overall, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases.
