Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program iterates through the input string `s` and the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' simultaneously, checking if the characters match. If the program reaches the end of the target string, it means that the input string contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it covers all potential cases.
