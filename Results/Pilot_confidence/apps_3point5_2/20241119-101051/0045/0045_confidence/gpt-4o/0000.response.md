Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: 
1. The program first calculates the minimum possible sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. It then checks if this minimum sum is greater than the given number n. If it is, it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
3. It then calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum.
4. It calculates the remainder and distributes it among the sequence to make sure the sum is equal to n.
5. The program then constructs the sequence by multiplying each element by d and adding the remainder appropriately.
6. Finally, it prints the resulting sequence or -1 if no sequence is possible.

The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides a correct solution.
