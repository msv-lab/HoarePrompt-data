Correctness: False, Confidence: 100

The given program simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The correct approach should involve finding the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y. The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, as it does not consider the necessary operations to transform the triangle.
