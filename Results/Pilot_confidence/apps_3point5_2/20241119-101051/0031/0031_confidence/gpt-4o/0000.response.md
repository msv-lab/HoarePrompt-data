Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It follows the given problem description and provides the output as an irreducible fraction modulo 10^6 + 3. The logic used to calculate the probability is sound and the program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. No specific case has been identified where the program does not work as expected.
