To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Inputs**: The function takes three parameters: `n` (number of bus routes), `t` (time Serval arrives at the bus station), and `bus_routes` (a list of tuples where each tuple contains the first bus arrival time `s_i` and the interval `d_i` for the i-th bus route).
  
2. **Logic**:
   - The program initializes `min_wait_time` to infinity and `chosen_route` to -1.
   - It iterates over each bus route:
     - If the first bus arrives after Serval arrives (`s_i >= t`), it calculates the wait time as `s_i - t`.
     - If Serval arrives exactly when a bus is scheduled (`(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`), the wait time is set to 0.
     - If Serval arrives before the first bus and there are subsequent buses, it calculates the wait time for the next bus as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.
   - The program updates the chosen bus route if the current wait time is less than the minimum wait time found so far.

3. **Output**: The function returns the index of the bus route that Serval will take.

### Potential Edge Cases
Now, let's consider possible edge cases to see if the program handles all scenarios correctly:

1. **Case when Serval arrives before the first bus of all routes**: If `t` is less than `s_i` for all routes, the program should pick the first bus that arrives after `t`. The current logic seems to handle this correctly.

2. **Case when multiple buses arrive at the same time**: The problem states that if multiple buses arrive at the same time, any of them may be chosen. The program's logic accounts for this by updating the `chosen_route` whenever a new minimum wait time is found.

3. **Case when Serval arrives exactly at the first bus time**: If `t` equals `s_i` for any route, the wait time is correctly set to 0, and that route will be chosen.

4. **Case when `t` is greater than the first bus time but not aligned**: The calculation of wait time when `t` is between `s_i` and the next bus time seems to be handled correctly.

### Conclusion
After analyzing the code and considering various edge cases, it appears that the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. There are no detected scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements.

### Final Assessment
Correctness: **True**  
Confidence: **95**  

(Note: I rated the confidence at 95 instead of 100 because while the logic looks correct, there might be very specific edge cases that were not explicitly tested, but based on the logic and the problem description, I believe it is correct.)
