To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

The problem requires us to determine the minimum number of variables `m` such that we can perform a specific sequence of operations defined by the positive integer sequence `a`. The first operation assigns the first element of `a` to a variable, and each subsequent operation assigns the value that is the sum of two previously assigned variables to match the next element in `a`.

### Analysis of the Code

1. **Sorting the Input**: The program starts by sorting the list `a`. This is not necessary since the operations depend on the values and their relationships, not their order.

2. **Tracking Assigned Values**: The program uses a set `assigned` to keep track of the values that have been assigned to the variables. It starts with the first value of `a` assigned.

3. **Checking Combinations**: For each subsequent value in `a`, the program checks if it can be formed by adding two previously assigned values. If it cannot be formed, it increments the variable count `m`.

4. **Returning the Count**: Finally, the program returns the count of variables `m`.

### Potential Issues

The critical flaw in the logic is that it only checks if the current value can be formed by the sum of any two previously assigned values. However, it does not account for the possibility that a value might be needed that cannot be formed even if all previous values are assigned correctly. Specifically:

- If the input sequence requires a value that is not the sum of any two previously assigned values, the program does not properly account for that scenario.
- The program does not consider cases where the sequence might require more complex combinations of previously assigned values.

### Example of Failure

Consider the input:
```
4
1 2 3 5
```
- The program will assign `1` to `b_1`.
- It will assign `2` to `b_2` (since `1 + 1` is not needed).
- It will then assign `3` (which can be formed by `1 + 2`).
- Finally, it will attempt to assign `5`, which cannot be formed by any combination of previously assigned values (`1`, `2`, `3`).

In this case, the program would incorrectly return `2`, while it actually needs at least `3` variables to handle the operations correctly.

### Conclusion

Given the identified flaw in the logic and the example that demonstrates the failure of the program to meet the problem requirements, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**  
Confidence: **90**
