To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the problem description and identify whether it correctly counts the number of prefixes of an infinite string `t` with a specified balance.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Reading Input:** The program correctly reads multiple test cases and extracts the necessary values: the length of the string `n`, the desired balance `x`, and the binary string `s`.

2. **Calculating Balance:** The balance of the string `s` is computed as the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's. This is done correctly.

3. **Prefix Balance Calculation:** The program constructs a list of prefix balances for the string `s`, which is also correct.

4. **Handling Cases:**
   - **When the total balance is zero:** If the balance of `s` is zero, the program checks if `x` exists in the prefixes. If `x` is found in the prefix balances, it returns `-1` indicating infinite prefixes can achieve the balance `x`. If `x` is not found, it returns `0`.
   - **When the total balance is non-zero:** The program counts how many prefixes can lead to the desired balance `x` by checking if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and if `(x - b) // balance >= 0` for each prefix balance `b`.

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Infinite Cases:** The program should correctly identify when there are infinite valid prefixes. For instance, if `s` consists entirely of '0's, the balance will be positive, and if `x` is a non-negative integer, it should return infinite prefixes. The current implementation seems to handle this correctly.

2. **Negative Balance:** If `s` contains more '1's than '0's, the balance will be negative. The program should still correctly identify valid prefixes for negative values of `x`.

3. **Single Character Strings:** For cases like `s = "0"` or `s = "1"`, the program should correctly identify the number of prefixes with balance `0` or `-1`, respectively.

### Example Testing:

- **Test Case 1:** `n = 1, x = 0, s = "0"`  
  This should return `1` because the only prefix with balance `0` is the empty prefix.

- **Test Case 2:** `n = 1, x = 0, s = "1"`  
  This should return `0` because there are no prefixes with balance `0`.

### Conclusion:

After thorough analysis, I did not find any cases where the program fails to meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The program seems to handle all specified edge cases correctly.

Correctness: **True**  
Confidence: **90**  

(Note: The confidence is slightly less than 100 due to the complexity of edge cases, but overall the implementation appears robust.)
