To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze its logic against the problem description.

### Problem Description
We need to calculate the sum of all integers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that contain at most `k` different digits, and return the result modulo `998244353`.

### Code Analysis
1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` defines a nested function `count` that calculates the number of integers up to `n` that can be formed with at most `k` different digits.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: It uses a memoization technique (dictionary `dp`) to store previously computed results for efficiency.
3. **Counting Logic**: The logic in the `count` function seems to attempt to count valid numbers based on the number of different digits allowed, but the implementation is complex and not straightforward.

### Potential Issues
The code calculates the count of numbers but does not directly compute their sum. It might be incorrectly assuming that the count of valid numbers can be directly used to derive the sum, which is not the case. 

For instance:
- If `l = 10`, `r = 50`, and `k = 2`, the valid numbers are `10, 11, 12, ..., 50`, which includes numbers with two different digits such as `22`, `33`, etc. However, the logic could miss specific numbers or miscalculate the contribution of each valid number to the sum.

### Example Case
Consider the case where `l = 1`, `r = 10`, and `k = 1`. The valid numbers are `1`, `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`, and `10`. The sum should be `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45` (the number `10` has two different digits and should not be included). The current implementation may incorrectly include numbers with more than `k` different digits or fail to sum correctly.

### Conclusion
Since I found a potential case where the logic may not work as expected, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements entirely.

Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **90** 

This confidence level indicates a strong belief that the code will fail for specific cases, particularly where the digit count exceeds `k`.
