Correctness: **False**  
Confidence: **80**

The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to account for the scenario where the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal, and there are unknown votes. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2 2 1
```
In this case, there are 2 upvotes, 2 downvotes, and 1 unknown vote. The possible outcomes for the unknown vote are:
- If the unknown vote is an upvote, the result is 3 upvotes and 2 downvotes, which gives a result of "+".
- If the unknown vote is a downvote, the result is 2 upvotes and 3 downvotes, which gives a result of "-".

Since there are two different possible outcomes depending on how the unknown vote is cast, the result should be uncertain ("?"). However, the program would incorrectly output "0" because it only checks for the case where `x == y` and `z > 0`, which is not aligned with the problem requirements.

Thus, the program fails in this scenario, and there are likely other edge cases that could lead to incorrect results as well.
