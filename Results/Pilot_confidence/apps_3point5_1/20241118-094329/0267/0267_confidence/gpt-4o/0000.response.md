Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. It iterates through each number in the range $l$ to $r$ and checks if the number satisfies the condition using the `func_1` function. If it does, it adds the number to the total sum. The modulo operation is also correctly applied. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
