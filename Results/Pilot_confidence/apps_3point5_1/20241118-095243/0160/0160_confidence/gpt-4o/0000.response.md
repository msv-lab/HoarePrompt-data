Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the problem description by finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements in A and then finds the divisors of the sum of A. It then iterates through the divisors in descending order and checks if each divisor satisfies the condition for dividing every element of A after the operations. If a divisor is found that satisfies the condition, it is printed as the output. The code covers all potential cases and correctly outputs the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A.
