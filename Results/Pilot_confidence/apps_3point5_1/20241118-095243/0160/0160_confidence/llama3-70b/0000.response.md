Correctness: True, Confidence: 95

I am confident that the program is correct because it correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations by finding the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A and then iterating through the divisors of the gcd to find the maximum divisor. The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases.
