Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of colors, keeping track of the counts of each color in a sliding window. It checks if the current counts match the desired counts, and if so, returns 'YES'. If the loop completes without finding a match, it returns 'NO'. The program covers all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
