Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program takes in two integers n and k, then it generates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers whose sum is equal to n. The program also ensures that the greatest common divisor of the sequence is maximal. It correctly handles cases where n < k and outputs -1 in such scenarios. The program iterates through the numbers from 1 to k and adds them to the sequence if n is greater than or equal to the number. It stops adding numbers if n becomes less than the current number. Finally, it prints the resulting sequence as required. The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and works correctly for all of them.
