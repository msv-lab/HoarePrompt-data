Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program reads two very long integers a and b as strings, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them based on their lengths and lexicographical order. The logic implemented in the code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases, including when the numbers are equal, one is greater than the other, or have different lengths. The code also handles cases where the input numbers contain leading zeroes. Since the program covers all possible scenarios and the logic is implemented correctly, I am confident in the correctness of the program.
