Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The program correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem. It maintains two queues, one for depublicans and one for remocrats, and alternates between popping elements from each queue based on their index. The program correctly handles the case where an employee is denied the right to vote and skips their turn. The outcome of the vote is determined based on which queue is not empty at the end. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases.
