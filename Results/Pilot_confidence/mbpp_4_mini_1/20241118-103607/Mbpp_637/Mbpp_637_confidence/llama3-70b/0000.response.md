Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **95**

The program correctly checks whether the given amount has no profit and no loss by verifying if the cost price is equal to the selling price. The logic is straightforward: if the two prices are equal, it indicates that there is neither profit nor loss. 

I am 95% confident as the function handles all potential cases where the cost price and selling price can be equal, regardless of their actual values (positive, negative, or zero). However, I left a small margin of uncertainty due to the general nature of the task, as there might be edge cases not considered in a broader context.
