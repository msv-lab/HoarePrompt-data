Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **90**

The program correctly implements the requirement to add the given tuple to the given list. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, converts the tuple to a list, and concatenates it with the original list. It handles all potential cases, including:

1. Adding an empty tuple to a list (the list remains unchanged).
2. Adding a non-empty tuple to a list (the elements of the tuple are appended to the list).
3. Handling different data types within the tuple and list (since Python lists can contain mixed types).

Since I cannot think of any case where the program does not meet the problem description's requirements, I am confident that the program is correct. However, I leave a slight margin of uncertainty (90) as there might be edge cases that are less obvious, but overall the implementation adheres to the description provided.
