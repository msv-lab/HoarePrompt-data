Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **95**

The provided program correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The use of the `replace` method is appropriate for this task, and the assertions provided confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. 

The function will handle various strings containing spaces correctly, including leading, trailing, and multiple spaces between words. However, I assigned a confidence level of 95 instead of 100 because while the function works for typical cases, there could be edge cases or specific scenarios that have not been tested, such as handling empty strings or strings with only spaces. 

Nonetheless, based on the provided information and the function's implementation, it meets the problem description requirements.
