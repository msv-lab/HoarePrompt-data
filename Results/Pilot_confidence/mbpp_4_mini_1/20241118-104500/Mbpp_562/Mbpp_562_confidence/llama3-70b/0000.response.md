Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **80**

The provided function `func_1` is intended to find the length of the longest sublist in a list of lists. However, it does not handle the case where the input `lists` is empty. In such a case, calling `max()` on an empty iterable will raise a `ValueError`. 

For example, if the input is `func_1([])`, the function will throw an error instead of returning a valid output. This means the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, specifically when the input is an empty list.

Thus, the program is incorrect as it fails to handle this edge case.
