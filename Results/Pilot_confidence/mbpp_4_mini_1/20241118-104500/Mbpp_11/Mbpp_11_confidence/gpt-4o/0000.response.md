Correctness: **False**  
Confidence: **90**  

The program does not correctly handle the case where the character to be removed does not exist in the string. According to the problem description, the function should return the original string if the character is not found. However, if the character is found only once, the function currently returns the original string instead of removing it. 

For example, consider the input `func_1('hello', 'h')`. The expected output should be `'ello'` since the first and last occurrence of 'h' should be removed. However, the function will return `'hello'`, which is incorrect.

This indicates that the logic for handling the case when the character appears only once is flawed. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
