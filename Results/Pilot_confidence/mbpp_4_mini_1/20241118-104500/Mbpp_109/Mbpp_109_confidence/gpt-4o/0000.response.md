To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1`.

The task is to count how many times the integer value of a binary string (after rotating it a specified number of times) is odd. The function rotates the binary string to the right by one position for the specified number of rotations and checks if the resulting integer value is odd.

### Analysis of the Code:
1. **Rotation Logic**: The line `binary_str = binary_str[-1] + binary_str[:-1]` correctly rotates the string to the right.
2. **Conversion to Integer**: The conversion `int(binary_str, 2)` is correctly converting the rotated binary string to its integer representation.
3. **Odd Check**: The condition `if integer_value % 2 == 1` correctly checks if the integer value is odd.
4. **Counting**: The count is incremented correctly for each odd integer value found.

### Edge Cases:
- The function does not handle cases where `num_rotations` is greater than the length of the binary string. However, since rotating a binary string of length `n` by `n` or more times will result in the same string, the current implementation will still yield correct results. 
- If `num_rotations` is zero, the function will return 0, which is also correct since no rotations mean we check the original string.

### Testing:
The provided assertions seem to cover various scenarios:
- `func_1('011001', 6)` checks all rotations of the string length 6.
- `func_1('11011', 5)` checks all rotations of a string of length 5.
- `func_1('1010', 4)` checks all rotations of a string of length 4.

All these cases return the expected results.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing the code and considering edge cases, I could not identify any scenario where the program fails to meet the problem description. The logic appears sound, and the assertions confirm that the function behaves as expected.

Correctness: **True**  
Confidence: **90**  

(Note: I am slightly less than 100% confident due to the potential for edge cases not covered in the assertions, but overall, the logic seems solid.)
