Correctness: **False** , Confidence: **90**

The program does not handle the case where the second list contains a zero. If `list2` has a zero, the division will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which means the program will not behave as expected for all potential cases. For example, calling `func_1([1, 2, 3], [0, 1, 2])` would cause an error due to division by zero, which violates the problem description of dividing two lists element-wise. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
