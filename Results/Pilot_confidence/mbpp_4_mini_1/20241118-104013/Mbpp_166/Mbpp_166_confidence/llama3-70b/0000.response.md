To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1` and see if it meets the requirements of the problem description, which states that we need to count the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Analysis of the Program:
1. The function iterates through all unique pairs of integers in the list `nums`.
2. It checks if the XOR of each pair is even by using the condition `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0`.
3. If the condition is satisfied, it increments the `count`.

### Understanding XOR:
- The XOR operation results in an even number if both operands are either even or both are odd. This is because:
  - Even ^ Even = Even
  - Odd ^ Odd = Even
  - Even ^ Odd = Odd
  - Odd ^ Even = Odd

### Checking for Correctness:
- The program correctly identifies pairs of integers whose XOR is even based on the properties of XOR.
- It checks all unique pairs (i, j) where i < j, ensuring each pair is counted only once.

### Edge Cases:
- An empty list should return 0, which the code handles correctly since there are no pairs to consider.
- A list with one element should also return 0, which is handled correctly.
- A list with all even or all odd numbers will yield the maximum pairs since all pairs will XOR to an even number.

### Conclusion:
Given that the function correctly counts pairs that yield an even XOR for all possible cases, I cannot find any input or potential case where the program fails to meet the problem description.

Correctness: **True**  
Confidence: **100**
