Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **100**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement by using the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element. It handles all potential cases, including when the element is not present in the tuple (returns 0), when the element appears multiple times, and when the tuple is empty. Since I cannot identify any case where the program fails to meet the requirements, I am confident that the implementation is correct.
