Correctness: **False**  
Confidence: **90**

The program is intended to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it only retains uppercase characters. This does not satisfy the requirement of removing lowercase substrings; instead, it only filters out lowercase characters, which is not the same.

For example, given the input "abcDEFghi", the expected output should be "DEF" (removing the lowercase substrings "abc" and "ghi"), but the program would return "DEF" which is correct in this case. However, if we consider the input "abc", it would return an empty string, which does not indicate that the lowercase substring has been removed, as the problem description does not specify handling for cases where the entire string is lowercase.

Additionally, if the string contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, the program does not provide any indication of where the lowercase substrings were located or that they were removed, which could be misinterpreted.

Thus, the program does not fully adhere to the problem description, as it does not handle the removal of entire lowercase substrings but only filters out lowercase characters.
