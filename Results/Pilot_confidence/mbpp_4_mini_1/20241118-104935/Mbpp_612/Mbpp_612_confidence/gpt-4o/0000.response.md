Correctness: **False** , Confidence: **90**

The provided program does not handle cases where the sublists do not contain exactly two elements. For example, if we call `func_1([[1], [2], [3]])`, this will raise an `IndexError` because the sublists do not have a second element. The problem description specifies that each sublist should have two elements, but the program does not enforce this requirement or handle the case where it is violated.

Additionally, the last assertion in the provided code has a syntax error because it is missing a closing bracket for the list. This will cause the program to fail before even reaching the point of validating the functionality.

Hence, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
