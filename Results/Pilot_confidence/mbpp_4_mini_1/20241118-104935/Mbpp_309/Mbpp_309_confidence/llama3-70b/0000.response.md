Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **100**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to find the maximum of two numbers. The use of Python's built-in `max` function ensures that it handles all potential cases, including positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. Since I cannot identify any input cases where the function would fail to return the correct maximum value, I am confident that the implementation is correct.
