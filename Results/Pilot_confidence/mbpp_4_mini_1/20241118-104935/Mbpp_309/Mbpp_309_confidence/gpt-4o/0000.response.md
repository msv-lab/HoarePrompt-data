Correctness: **True** , Confidence: **90**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that correctly implements the logic to find the maximum of two numbers. The function uses a conditional expression to return `a` if it is greater than `b`, otherwise it returns `b`. 

The assertions provided in the program cover various cases:
1. `func_1(5, 10)` returns `10`, which is correct.
2. `func_1(-1, -2)` returns `-1`, which is also correct since -1 is greater than -2.
3. `func_1(9, 7)` returns `9`, which is again correct.

The function handles both positive and negative numbers correctly, and there are no edge cases (like equal numbers) that would cause it to fail based on the given problem description. 

I am confident in my assessment, but I have noted a slight uncertainty (10%) because the function does not explicitly handle the case where both numbers are equal. However, since the problem description does not specify behavior for equal numbers, the current implementation meets the basic requirement of finding the maximum of two numbers.
