Correctness: **False**, Confidence: **90**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases for converting complex numbers to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` uses `complex(num)` to convert the input `num` to a complex number. However, this implementation only works correctly for real numbers (like 1, 4, 5) and does not account for complex inputs or edge cases such as:

1. Complex numbers: If the input is a complex number, like `1 + 2j`, the function will still work, but this is not explicitly tested in the assertions.
2. Strings or other non-numeric types: The function will raise an error if a string or other non-numeric type is passed, as `complex(num)` will not handle those cases gracefully.
3. Zero: The polar coordinates for the complex number `0` should be `(0.0, 0.0)`, but this case is not tested.

Since the assertions only check for specific real numbers and do not cover a wide range of possible inputs, the program is incomplete and incorrect in its current form.
