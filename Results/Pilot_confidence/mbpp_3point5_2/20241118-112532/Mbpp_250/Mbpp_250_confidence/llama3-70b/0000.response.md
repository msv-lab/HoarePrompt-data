Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. This implementation directly aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, I am 100% confident that the program is correct.
