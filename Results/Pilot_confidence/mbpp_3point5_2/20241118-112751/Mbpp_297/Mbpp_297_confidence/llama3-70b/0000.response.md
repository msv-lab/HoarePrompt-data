Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided function recursively flattens a nested list structure by checking each element and if it's a list, it calls itself recursively on that element until all nested lists are flattened. This logic covers all potential cases of nested lists and correctly flattens them. Since the function handles all possible cases as described in the problem, I am confident in marking it as correct.
