Correctness: True
Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided function correctly gets the difference between two lists by first converting them to sets to remove duplicates, then using the symmetric difference operator (^) to get the elements that are unique to each list. The result is then sorted before being returned. This logic covers all potential cases and the program works as expected.
