Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided function takes a binary string `s` and an integer `n`, then rotates the string `n` times and counts the number of numbers with an odd value (1) in each rotation. The function achieves this by concatenating `s` enough times to cover `n` rotations, then iterates through each rotation, counts the number of '1's, and checks if the count is odd. This logic correctly follows the problem description and should work for all potential cases.
