Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The provided function correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in the input list of lists by using a generator expression and the `max` function. It iterates through each sublist in the input list and calculates the length of each sublist, then returns the maximum length found. This logic covers all potential cases and the program works as expected.
