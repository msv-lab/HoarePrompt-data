Correctness: False, Confidence: 100

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the list is not sorted in ascending order. For example, the input [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20] should return False according to the problem description, but the program incorrectly returns True.
