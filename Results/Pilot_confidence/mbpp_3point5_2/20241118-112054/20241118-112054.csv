Explanation: The provided function correctly checks if the given tuple has any `None` value by using the `any` function with a generator expression that checks if each element in the tuple is `None`.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `any` function to check if there is any `None` value in the given tuple. The condition `(x is None for x in tup)` generates a boolean value for each element in the tuple, and `any` returns `True` if any of those values is `True`, indicating the presence of a `None` value.
