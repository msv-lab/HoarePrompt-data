Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

The program defines a function that takes in a dictionary of student names and their corresponding heights and weights, as well as minimum height and weight values. It then filters out the students whose height and weight are above the minimum values.

The provided test cases cover a range of scenarios where the function should correctly filter out the students based on the minimum height and weight requirements. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to achieve this filtering, and the logic seems sound.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the test cases, I am confident that the program is correct for all potential cases.
