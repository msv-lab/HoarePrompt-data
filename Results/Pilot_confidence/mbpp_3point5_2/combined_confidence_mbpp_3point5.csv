Explanation: The provided function correctly checks if the given tuple has any `None` value by using the `any` function with a generator expression that checks if each element in the tuple is `None`.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `any` function to check if there is any `None` value in the given tuple. The condition `(x is None for x in tup)` generates a boolean value for each element in the tuple, and `any` returns `True` if any of those values is `True`, indicating the presence of a `None` value.

The provided program is incorrect because it does not return the correct difference between two lists as per the problem description. The issue lies in the sorting logic used in the `result_list.sort()` function. The lambda function used to sort the elements in `result_list` is based on the index of the elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`, which does not guarantee the correct order of elements based on the difference between the two lists. 

For example, if we consider the input `func_1([10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40], [25, 40, 35])`, the expected output should be `[10, 20, 30, 15]`, but the program will return `[10, 30, 20, 15]` due to the incorrect sorting logic.
