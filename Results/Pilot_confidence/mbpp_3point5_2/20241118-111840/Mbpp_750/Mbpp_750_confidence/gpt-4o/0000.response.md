Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)`, and then concatenates it with the original list `lst` using the `+` operator. The provided test cases demonstrate that the function correctly adds the elements of the tuple to the list, resulting in the expected output. Since all test cases pass and there are no potential edge cases where the function might fail, I am confident in the correctness of the program.
