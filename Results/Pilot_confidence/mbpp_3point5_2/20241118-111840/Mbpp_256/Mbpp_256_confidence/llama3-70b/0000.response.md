Correctness: True, Confidence: 100

I am confident that the program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`. The inner function `is_prime` correctly identifies prime numbers. The program iterates through numbers from 2 to `n-1` and counts the prime numbers. Since the logic is sound and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description, I am confident that the program works as expected for all inputs.
