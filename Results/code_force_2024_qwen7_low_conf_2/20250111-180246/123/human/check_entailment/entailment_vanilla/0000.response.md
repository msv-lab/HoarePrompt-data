Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to check if it correctly implements the logic to maximize the given expression:

\[ \text{Expression} = |a_i - a_j| + |a_j - a_k| + |a_k - a_l| + |a_l - a_i| \]

for all possible distinct indices \(i, j, k, l\) from the array.

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case separately.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself.
   - It then finds the minimum and maximum values in the array, which is correct since these extreme values can potentially contribute the most to the expression.

3. **Calculating Maximum Expression Value**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum value of the expression is:
     \[ \text{max_expression_value} = 4 \times (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val}) \]
   - This formula is derived because the maximum difference between any two numbers in the array, when considering the cyclic nature of the expression, would be the difference between the maximum and minimum values multiplied by 4. This is correct under the given constraints.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case on separate lines.

Given the explanation, the provided program seems to follow the correct logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
