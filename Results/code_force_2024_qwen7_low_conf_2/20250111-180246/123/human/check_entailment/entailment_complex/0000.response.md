Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through each test case, finding the minimum and maximum values in the array, and then calculating the expression \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\). This approach is correct because the expression \(|a_i - a_j| + |a_j - a_k| + |a_k - a_l| + |a_l - a_i|\) can be simplified when considering the extreme values in the array. The maximum possible value of the expression occurs when the differences between the elements are maximized, which happens when \(a_i\) is the maximum value and \(a_j\) is the minimum value in the array.

Let's break down the steps:
1. The program correctly reads the number of test cases and initializes variables to process each test case.
2. For each test case, it correctly reads the size of the array and the array itself.
3. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array.
4. It calculates the expression \(4 \times (\text{max\_val} - \text{min\_val})\), which is indeed the maximum value of the given expression since the expression is maximized when the difference between the largest and smallest values is maximized.

The program does not need to consider every combination of \(i, j, k, l\) because the maximum difference between any two elements in the array will always be between the maximum and minimum values. Therefore, the logic is sound and the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**
