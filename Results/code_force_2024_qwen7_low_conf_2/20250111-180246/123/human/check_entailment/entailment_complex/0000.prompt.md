You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Given an array a of n elements, find the maximum value of the expression:

where i , j , k , and l are four distinct indices of the array a , with 1 \le
i, j, k, l \le n .

Here |x| denotes the absolute value of x .

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (4 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the given array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^6 \le a_i \le 10^6 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum value.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 1 2 2 3
    
    8
    
    5 1 3 2 -3 -1 10 3
    
    4
    
    3 3 1 1
    
    4
    
    1 2 2 -1

Output

    0
    6
    38
    8
    8
    
Note

In the first test case, for any selection of i , j , k , l , the answer will
be 0 . For example, |a_1 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_4| + |a_4 - a_1| = |1
- 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 .

In the second test case, for i = 1 , j = 3 , k = 2 , and l = 5 , the answer
will be 6 . |a_1 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_5| + |a_5 - a_1| = |1 - 2| +
|2 - 1| + |1 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 .

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `results` is a list containing the values `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for each iteration, `idx` is equal to its original value plus `t` times `(1 + n)`, `n` is the `n` value from the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + (t-1)*n:idx + t*n]` and contains at least one element, `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it calculates the expression `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, where `max_val` is the maximum value and `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`. The function collects these calculated values in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each value in `results` on a new line. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `t` is 1 or where `n` is the minimum allowed value (i.e., 4). If the input does not follow the specified format, the function may behave unpredictably due to the assumptions made about the structure of `data`. The function does not handle missing or invalid input values explicitly.
