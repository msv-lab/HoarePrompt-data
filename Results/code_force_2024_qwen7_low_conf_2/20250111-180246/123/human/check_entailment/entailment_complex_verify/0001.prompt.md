You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n elements, find the maximum value of the expression:

where i , j , k , and l are four distinct indices of the array a , with 1 \le
i, j, k, l \le n .

Here |x| denotes the absolute value of x .

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (4 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the given array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^6 \le a_i \le 10^6 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum value.

Example

    4
    
    3 3 1 1
    
    4
    
    1 2 2 -1

Output

    0
    6
    38
    8
    8
    
Note

In the first test case, for any selection of i , j , k , l , the answer will
be 0 . For example, |a_1 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_4| + |a_4 - a_1| = |1
- 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 .

In the second test case, for i = 1 , j = 3 , k = 2 , and l = 5 , the answer
will be 6 . |a_1 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_5| + |a_5 - a_1| = |1 - 2| +
|2 - 1| + |1 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 .

    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        min_val = float('inf')
        max_val = float('-inf')
        for num in a:
            if num < min_val:
                min_val = num
            if num > max_val:
                max_val = num
        max_expression_value = 4 * (max_val - min_val)
        results.append(max_expression_value)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `results` is a list containing the values `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for each iteration, `idx` is equal to its original value plus `t` times `(1 + n)`, `n` is the `n` value from the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + (t-1)*n:idx + t*n]` and contains at least one element, `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it calculates the expression `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, where `max_val` is the maximum value and `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`. The function collects these calculated values in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each value in `results` on a new line. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `t` is 1 or where `n` is the minimum allowed value (i.e., 4). If the input does not follow the specified format, the function may behave unpredictably due to the assumptions made about the structure of `data`. The function does not handle missing or invalid input values explicitly.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the provided program, we need to check if it correctly implements the logic to maximize the given expression:

\[ \text{Expression} = |a_i - a_j| + |a_j - a_k| + |a_k - a_l| + |a_l - a_i| \]

for all possible distinct indices \(i, j, k, l\) from the array.

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program reads all input data at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case separately.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself.
   - It then finds the minimum and maximum values in the array, which is correct since these extreme values can potentially contribute the most to the expression.

3. **Calculating Maximum Expression Value**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum value of the expression is:
     \[ \text{max_expression_value} = 4 \times (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val}) \]
   - This formula is derived because the maximum difference between any two numbers in the array, when considering the cyclic nature of the expression, would be the difference between the maximum and minimum values multiplied by 4. This is correct under the given constraints.

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case on separate lines.

Given the explanation, the provided program seems to follow the correct logic to solve the problem.

Correctness: **True**
