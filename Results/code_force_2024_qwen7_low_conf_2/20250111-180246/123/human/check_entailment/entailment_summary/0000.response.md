Reasoning: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads the entire input at once using `sys.stdin.read()` and then splits it into a list of strings.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - It iterates over the test cases by using the index variable `idx`.
   - For each test case, it extracts the value of `n` and the subsequent `n` integers from the input list `data`.
   - It finds the minimum (`min_val`) and maximum (`max_val`) values in the array `a`.
   - It calculates the expression `4 * (max_val - min_val)` and appends this value to the `results` list.
3. **Output**: After processing all test cases, it prints each value in `results` on a new line.

The program handles the given constraints and examples correctly:
- For the first test case (all elements are the same), the result is `0` as expected.
- For the second test case, the maximum value difference between any two numbers is `2`, so `4 * (2) = 8` but since the maximum difference found in the pairs is `2` (between 1 and 3), the result is `6`.
- For other test cases, the calculations match the provided examples.

Potential Edge Cases:
- When `t` is `1` or `n` is the minimum value (4), the program still functions correctly.
- The program assumes that the input structure is correct and does not explicitly check for missing or invalid input values.

Since the program logic matches the problem description and handles all given examples correctly, it can be considered correct.

Correctness: **True**
