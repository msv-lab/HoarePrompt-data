Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the maximum value of the expression \(4 \times (max\_val - min\_val)\), but this approach is incorrect because the expression \(|a_i - a_j| + |a_j - a_k| + |a_k - a_l| + |a_l - a_i|\) does not necessarily simplify to \(4 \times (max\_val - min\_val)\). 

To see why, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5
1 1 2 2 3
```
- Expected output: 6
- Program output: 8

The program calculates \(4 \times (3 - 1) = 8\), but the correct value is 6, as explained in Example 2. Specifically, for \(i=1\), \(j=3\), \(k=2\), and \(l=5\), the expression evaluates to \(|1 - 2| + |2 - 2| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4\), which is not included in the program's calculation. Therefore, the program does not handle all possible cases correctly.
