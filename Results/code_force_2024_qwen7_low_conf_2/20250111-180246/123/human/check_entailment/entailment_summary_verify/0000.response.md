### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the program step-by-step to determine its correctness:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The goal is to maximize the expression \(|a_i - a_j| + |a_j - a_k| + |a_k - a_l| + |a_l - a_i|\) for distinct indices \(i, j, k, l\) in the array \(a\).

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it extracts the number of elements \(n\) and the array \(a\).
   - It then computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, multiplying this difference by 4.

3. **Function Summary**:
   - The function calculates \(4 \times (max\_val - min\_val)\) for each test case.
   - This simplification assumes that the maximum expression value can be achieved by selecting the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is not always true.

4. **Example Test Case**:
   - Consider the test case provided in the original assessment:
     ```
     5
     1 1 2 2 3
     ```
   - The expected output is 6, as explained in the problem description.
   - The program output is 8.
   - This discrepancy arises because the program's approach does not account for the specific arrangement of values in the array that maximizes the expression.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program assumes the input is well-formed and structured, which may lead to issues if the input format is not strictly adhered to.
   - Edge cases like \(t = 1\) or \(n = 4\) are handled, but the core logic might still be flawed.

6. **Conclusion**:
   - The program's approach of using \(4 \times (max\_val - min\_val)\) is indeed incorrect. There are specific arrangements of values in the array that could yield higher values than this simplified expression.
   - The program fails to consider all possible configurations of the array that could maximize the expression.

### Final Evaluation:

**Final: False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not accurately compute the maximum value of the expression \(|a_i - a_j| + |a_j - a_k| + |a_k - a_l| + |a_l - a_i|\) for all possible configurations of the array.
