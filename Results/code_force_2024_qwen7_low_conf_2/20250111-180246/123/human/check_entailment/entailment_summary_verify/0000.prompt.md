You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Given an array a of n elements, find the maximum value of the expression:

where i , j , k , and l are four distinct indices of the array a , with 1 \le
i, j, k, l \le n .

Here |x| denotes the absolute value of x .

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 500 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (4 \le n \le 100
) — the length of the given array.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n
(-10^6 \le a_i \le 10^6 ).

Output

For each test case, print a single integer — the maximum value.

Example

Input

    5
    
    4
    
    1 1 1 1
    
    5
    
    1 1 2 2 3
    
    8
    
    5 1 3 2 -3 -1 10 3
    
    4
    
    3 3 1 1
    
    4
    
    1 2 2 -1

Output

    0
    6
    38
    8
    8
    
Note

In the first test case, for any selection of i , j , k , l , the answer will
be 0 . For example, |a_1 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_4| + |a_4 - a_1| = |1
- 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| + |1 - 1| = 0 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 0 .

In the second test case, for i = 1 , j = 3 , k = 2 , and l = 5 , the answer
will be 6 . |a_1 - a_3| + |a_3 - a_2| + |a_2 - a_5| + |a_5 - a_1| = |1 - 2| +
|2 - 1| + |1 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 = 6 .

- Program:
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    t = int(data[0])
    idx = 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[idx])
        idx += 1
        a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))
        idx += n
        min_val = float('inf')
        max_val = float('-inf')
        for num in a:
            if num < min_val:
                min_val = num
            if num > max_val:
                max_val = num
        max_expression_value = 4 * (max_val - min_val)
        results.append(max_expression_value)
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it calculates the expression `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, where `max_val` is the maximum value and `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`. The function collects these calculated values in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each value in `results` on a new line. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `t` is 1 or where `n` is the minimum allowed value (i.e., 4). If the input does not follow the specified format, the function may behave unpredictably due to the assumptions made about the structure of `data`. The function does not handle missing or invalid input values explicitly.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the maximum value of the expression \(4 \times (max\_val - min\_val)\), but this approach is incorrect because the expression \(|a_i - a_j| + |a_j - a_k| + |a_k - a_l| + |a_l - a_i|\) does not necessarily simplify to \(4 \times (max\_val - min\_val)\). 

To see why, consider the following test case:
- Input:
```
5
1 1 2 2 3
```
- Expected output: 6
- Program output: 8

The program calculates \(4 \times (3 - 1) = 8\), but the correct value is 6, as explained in Example 2. Specifically, for \(i=1\), \(j=3\), \(k=2\), and \(l=5\), the expression evaluates to \(|1 - 2| + |2 - 2| + |2 - 3| + |3 - 1| = 1 + 0 + 1 + 2 = 4\), which is not included in the program's calculation. Therefore, the program does not handle all possible cases correctly.
