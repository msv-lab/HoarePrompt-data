### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided program and compare it with the problem description and the given function summary.

1. **Reading Input**:
   - The program correctly reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list of strings.
   - It correctly extracts the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case separately.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it extracts the size of the array (`n`) and the array itself.
   - It then finds the minimum and maximum values in the array. This step is correct because the maximum value of the expression \(4 \times (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val})\) ensures that the differences between the largest and smallest values in the array are maximized.

3. **Calculating Maximum Expression Value**:
   - The formula used to calculate the maximum value of the expression is:
     \[ \text{max_expression_value} = 4 \times (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val}) \]
   - This formula is derived correctly because the maximum possible value of the expression \(|a_i - a_j| + |a_j - a_k| + |a_k - a_l| + |a_l - a_i|\) for distinct indices \(i, j, k, l\) is indeed \(4 \times (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val})\).

4. **Output**:
   - The program correctly prints the results for each test case on separate lines.

Given this analysis, the program does appear to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. The function summary also aligns well with the behavior described in the original assessment.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment correctly identified the key points and the overall correctness of the program. There are no significant errors or misinterpretations in the program's logic.

**Final: True**

The given program is correct.
