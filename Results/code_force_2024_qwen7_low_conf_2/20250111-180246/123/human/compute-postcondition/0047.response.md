The code `min_val = num` updates the value of `min_val` to be equal to `num`. This affects only the `min_val` variable. The other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `min_val` is equal to `num`, and if `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is now equal to `num`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.**
