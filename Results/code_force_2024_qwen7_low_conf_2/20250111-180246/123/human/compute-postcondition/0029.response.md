Output State: **`a` contains all elements from the original list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`, and `max_val` is the maximum value within the list `a`.** 

### Explanation:
- **`a`**: The list `a` contains all the integers originally obtained from converting the sliced part of `data` to integers. Since the loop processes each element of `a` exactly once, `a` retains its complete list of integers.
  
- **`min_val`**: The variable `min_val` keeps track of the minimum value encountered in `a`. After the loop completes, `min_val` will be the smallest integer in the list `a`.

- **`max_val`**: The variable `max_val` keeps track of the maximum value encountered in `a`. After the loop completes, `max_val` will be the largest integer in the list `a`.

### Special Case: Loop Does Not Execute
If the loop does not execute (i.e., `a` is an empty list), then:
- `min_val` remains `positive infinity` (as specified in the initial state).
- `max_val` remains `negative infinity` (as specified in the initial state).

Thus, the final state after the loop has completed all iterations (or not executed at all) is captured as above.
