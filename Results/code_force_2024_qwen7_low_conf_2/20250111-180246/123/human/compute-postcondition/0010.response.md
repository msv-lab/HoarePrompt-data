`min_val` is assigned the value `float('inf')`. This initializes `min_val` to positive infinity. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `idx` is `2 + int(n)`; `results` is an empty list; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the sliced part of `data` to integers; `min_val` is positive infinity.
