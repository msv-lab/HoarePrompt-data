The code assigns a new value to `min_val`, but the specific value is not provided (it is referred to as `num`). Therefore, `min_val` is updated to be the value of `num`. The states of the other variables (`a`, `max_val`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`a` contains at least two elements, `min_val` is the value of `num`, `max_val` is either the same as the previous `max_val` or equal to the second element in `a` if it is greater.**
