The code `max_val = num` updates the value of `max_val` to the current value of `num`. However, the initial state mentions that if `num` is less than `min_val`, then `min_val` is updated to the value of `num`. Since `max_val` is set directly to `num` without considering the condition related to `min_val`, the value of `max_val` will only be updated to the value of `num`, regardless of whether `num` is less than `min_val`.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` contains at least two elements; `num` remains unchanged; `min_val` remains unchanged; `max_val` is now equal to `num`.

Output State: **`a` contains at least two elements; `num` remains unchanged; `min_val` remains unchanged; `max_val` is equal to `num`.**
