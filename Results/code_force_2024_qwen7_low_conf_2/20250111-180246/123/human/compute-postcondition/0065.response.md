The initial state includes `a` being a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the original list `a`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, and `n` is `n_val`.

The code snippet sets `max_val` to `float('-inf')`. This means that the new value of `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, which is the lowest possible value for a floating-point number.

All other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is `float('-inf')`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`**
