Let's break down the given Python code step by step:

- Initial State:
  - `a` is a list of integers with at least one element.
  - `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus `n`.
  - `t` is greater than 1.
  - `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`.
  - `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
  - `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.
  - `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it.
  - `n` is `n_val`.

- Code Execution:
  - `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))`
    - This line maps the elements from the slice of `data` starting at index `idx` and ending at `idx + n` to integers and assigns this new list to `a`.
    - The new list `a` will be composed of integers extracted from the specified slice of `data`.

- Updated Values:
  - The value of `a` changes to the new list of integers.
  - The values of `idx` and `n` remain unchanged because they are not reassigned.
  - `t`, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, and `results` also remain unchanged because these variables are not affected by the assignment.

- Output State:
  - `a` is now a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`.
  - `idx` remains equal to its original value plus 1 plus `n`.
  - `t` remains greater than 1.
  - `min_val` remains the minimum value in the original list `a`.
  - `max_val` remains the maximum value in the original list `a`.
  - `max_expression_value` remains `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.
  - `results` remains a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it.
  - `n` remains `n_val`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is the minimum value in the original list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the original list `a`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`.**
