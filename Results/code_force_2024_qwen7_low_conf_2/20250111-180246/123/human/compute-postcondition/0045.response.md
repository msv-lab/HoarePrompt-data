Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `min_val` is updated to `num` if `num` is less than the current `min_val`. If `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is now equal to `num`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.***
