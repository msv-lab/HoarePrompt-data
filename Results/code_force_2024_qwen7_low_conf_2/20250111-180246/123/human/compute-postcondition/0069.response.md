Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is the minimum value among the elements in `a`, `max_val` remains the same, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`, and `data[idx:idx + n]` must contain at least one element.***
