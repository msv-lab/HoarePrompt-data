The code sets `max_val` to the value of `num`. This means that the current value of `max_val` will be updated to the value of `num`. Other variables remain unaffected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `min_val` is equal to the minimum value between `min_val` and `num`, `max_val` is now equal to `num`.**
