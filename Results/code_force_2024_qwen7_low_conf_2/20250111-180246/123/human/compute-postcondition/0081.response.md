The code snippet sets `max_val` to the value of `num`. This affects the variables `max_val` and `max_expression_value`, as `max_expression_value` is calculated based on `max_val` and `min_val`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `max_val` is updated to the value of `num`.
2. Since `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, updating `max_val` to `num` changes `max_expression_value` to `4 * (num - min_val)`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + 1 + 2*n:idx + 1 + 3*n]` that must contain at least one element, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 3 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is the minimum of the original `min_val` and `num`, `max_val` is `num`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (num - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`**
