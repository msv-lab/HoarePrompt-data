Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`, and `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`.**

Explanation:
- After the loop executes, `min_val` will hold the smallest value in the list `a`, and `max_val` will hold the largest value in the list `a`. This is because the loop iterates through each number in `a` and updates `min_val` and `max_val` based on the conditions provided.
- The value of `idx` is increased by `1 + n` regardless of the number of iterations, as it is incremented outside the loop.
- The value of `t` remains unchanged and must still be greater than 0.
- The list `a` remains unchanged and contains the same integers it originally did, but now `min_val` and `max_val` reflect the minimum and maximum values within `a`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `a` is an empty list), then:
- `min_val` will remain infinity (as no number is smaller than infinity).
- `max_val` will remain negative infinity (as no number is larger than negative infinity).
- `idx` is increased by `1 + n` (even though the list is empty).
- `t` remains greater than 0.

However, since the problem statement specifies that the loop executes at least once, we assume `a` is a non-empty list.
