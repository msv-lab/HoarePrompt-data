The code `max_val = num` updates the value of `max_val` to be equal to `num`. 

From the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`
- `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`
- `t` is greater than 1
- `min_val` is the minimum value among the elements in `a`
- `max_val` remains the same (but now is equal to `num`)
- `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`
- `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it
- `n` is `n_val`
- `data[idx:idx + n]` must contain at least one element
- The current value of `num` is greater than `max_val`

After executing the code, `max_val` is updated to be equal to `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is the minimum value among the elements in `a`, `max_val` is equal to `num`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`, and `data[idx:idx + n]` must contain at least one element. The current value of `num` is greater than `max_val`.**
