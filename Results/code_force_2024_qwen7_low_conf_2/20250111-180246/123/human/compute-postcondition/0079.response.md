The code sets `min_val` to `num`. According to the initial state, `min_val` was previously determined by the condition `min_val = num` if `num < min_val`. This means that the current value of `min_val` is already equal to `num`, and setting it again to `num` does not change its value.

Other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state:
- `idx` is equal to its original value plus 3 plus 2 times `n`.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `max_val` is the maximum of the original `max_val` and `num`.
- `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.
- `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it.
- `n` is `n_val`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + 1 + 2*n:idx + 1 + 3*n]` that must contain at least one element, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 3 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is equal to `num`, `max_val` is the maximum of the original `max_val` and `num`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + 1 + 2*n:idx + 1 + 3*n]` that must contain at least one element, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 3 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is equal to `num`, `max_val` is the maximum of the original `max_val` and `num`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`**
