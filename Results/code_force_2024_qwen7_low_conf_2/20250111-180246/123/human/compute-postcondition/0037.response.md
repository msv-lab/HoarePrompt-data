The code sets `min_val` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This means that `min_val` is no longer the minimum value of the list `a`, but is instead set to infinity. The values of other variables such as `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, `results`, `t`, `idx`, and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`a` is the list of integers obtained by converting `data[idx:idx + n]` to integers; `min_val` is infinity; `max_val` is the maximum value within the new list `a`; `max_expression_value` is 4 \(\times\) (`max_val` - `min_val`); `results` is a list containing the value 4 \(\times\) (`max_val` - `min_val`); `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`.**
