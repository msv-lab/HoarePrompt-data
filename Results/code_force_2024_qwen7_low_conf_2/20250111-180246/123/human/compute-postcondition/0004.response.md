The code initializes an empty list called `results`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `data`, or `idx`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` (converted to an integer), `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input by whitespace, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
