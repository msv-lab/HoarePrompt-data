`idx` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `idx` is increased by 1. The values of other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` contains all elements from the original list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value within the list `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 \(\times\) (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val}), `results` is a list containing the value 4 \(\times\) (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val}), `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 1**
