`data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`. This means that `data` will store a list of strings, which are the results of splitting the input string by whitespace. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` are not yet processed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100; `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input by whitespace**
