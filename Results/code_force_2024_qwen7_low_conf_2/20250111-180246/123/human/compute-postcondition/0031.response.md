The code appends `max_expression_value` to the `results` list. The value of `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val). Since `max_expression_value` is a constant value derived from `max_val` and `min_val`, appending it to `results` does not change the values of `min_val`, `max_val`, or `a`. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`a` contains all elements from the original list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value within the list `a`, and `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val), results is a list containing the value 4 * (max_val - min_val)**.
