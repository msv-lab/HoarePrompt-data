The initial state is as follows:
- `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`
- `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`
- `t` is greater than 1
- `min_val` is the minimum value in the original list `a`
- `max_val` is the maximum value in the original list `a`
- `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`
- `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it
- `n` is `n_val`

The given code is:
```python
min_val = float('inf')
```

This line sets `min_val` to infinity (`float('inf')`). Since `min_val` was previously set to the minimum value in the original list `a`, setting it to infinity will affect the comparison when finding the new minimum value in the updated list `a`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is `float('inf')`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the original list `a`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`**
