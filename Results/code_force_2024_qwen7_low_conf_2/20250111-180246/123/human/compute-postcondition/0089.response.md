Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`. For each test case, it calculates the expression `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, where `max_val` is the maximum value and `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`. The function collects these calculated values in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints each value in `results` on a new line. Potential edge cases include scenarios where `t` is 1 or where `n` is the minimum allowed value (i.e., 4). If the input does not follow the specified format, the function may behave unpredictably due to the assumptions made about the structure of `data`. The function does not handle missing or invalid input values explicitly.**
