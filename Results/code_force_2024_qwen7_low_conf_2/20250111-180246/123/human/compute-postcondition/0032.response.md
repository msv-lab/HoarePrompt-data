According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop runs `t` times. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `a` contains all elements from the original list of integers.
- `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`.
- `max_val` is the maximum value within the list `a`.
- `max_expression_value` is calculated as \(4 \times (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val})\).
- `results` is a list containing the value \(4 \times (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val})\).

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than the number of iterations already performed.

Let's assume that after `k` iterations, the loop ends. This means that `t` was decremented by 1 in each iteration, so before the loop started, `t` was `k + 1`.

Since the loop has just ended, `t` is now `k`, meaning it has decremented by 1 from the initial value.

To execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0 (since `t` starts at a positive integer value).

Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`a` contains all elements from the original list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value within the list `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 \(\times\) (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val}), `results` is a list containing the value 4 \(\times\) (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val}), `t` must be greater than 0**.
