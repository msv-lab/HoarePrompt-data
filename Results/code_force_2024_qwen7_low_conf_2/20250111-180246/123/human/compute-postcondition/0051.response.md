Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least one element.
   - `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `min_val` is equal to the minimum value between `min_val` and `num`.
   - If `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is now equal to `num`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`.

3. **After the Last Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state just before the next iteration of the loop begins.
   - Since we are in the middle of the loop, the current element `num` has already been processed.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - `a` remains the same because we haven't removed or modified elements from the list yet.
   - `idx` was increased by 1 + `n` in the last iteration, so for the next iteration, `idx` will be increased by 1 + `n` again.
   - `t` remains greater than 0 as there is no information suggesting it changes within the loop.
   - `min_val` has been updated to the minimum value between `min_val` and `num` in the last iteration. Therefore, for the next iteration, `min_val` will be the minimum value between `min_val` (from the last iteration) and the next `num`.
   - `max_val` will be checked against the next `num`. If `num` is greater than `max_val`, then `max_val` will update to `num`. Otherwise, it remains unchanged.

5. **State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `idx` will be increased by 1 + `n` again.
   - `t` remains greater than 0.
   - `min_val` will be the minimum value between `min_val` (from the last iteration) and the next `num`.
   - `max_val` will be updated based on the next `num`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `min_val` is equal to the minimum value between `min_val` and the next `num`, and if the next `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is now equal to the next `num`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.**
