The code sets `max_val` to negative infinity (`float('-inf')`). This means that `max_val` is now negative infinity, which is less than any actual number. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is the list of integers obtained by converting `data[idx:idx + n]` to integers; `min_val` is infinity; `max_val` is negative infinity; `max_expression_value` is 4 \(\times\) (`max_val` - `min_val`); `results` is a list containing the value 4 \(\times\) (`max_val` - `min_val`); `t` must be greater than 0; `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`.**
