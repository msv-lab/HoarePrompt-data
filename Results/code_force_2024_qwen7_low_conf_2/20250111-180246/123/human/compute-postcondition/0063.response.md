The code `idx += n` increments the value of `idx` by `n`. Based on the initial state, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus `n`. Therefore, after the increment, `idx` will be equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`.

The states of other variables (`a`, `t`, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, and `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is the minimum value in the original list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the original list `a`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`.**
