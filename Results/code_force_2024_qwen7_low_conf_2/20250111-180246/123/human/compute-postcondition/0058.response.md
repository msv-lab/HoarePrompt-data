`results.append(max_expression_value)` appends the value of `max_expression_value` to the list `results`. The value of `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val), `results` is a list with the value 4 * (max_val - min_val) appended to it.**
