`min_val` is reassigned to the value of `num`. The value of `num` is the minimum value between `min_val` and the next `num`. Since `min_val` was previously equal to the minimum value between `min_val` and the next `num`, and `num` is now assigned to `min_val`, `min_val` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `min_val` is equal to the minimum value between `min_val` and the next `num`, and if the next `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is now equal to the next `num`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.
