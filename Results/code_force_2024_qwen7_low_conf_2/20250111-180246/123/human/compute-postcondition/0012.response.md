According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. The loop will execute as long as `a` is not empty. Before the loop starts, we know that `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the sliced part of `data` to integers. For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element.

Let's summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1 (unchanged, as this does not affect the loop's execution).
- `idx` is `2 + int(n)` (unchanged, as this does not affect the loop's execution).
- `results` is an empty list (unchanged, as this does not affect the loop's execution).
- `min_val` is positive infinity (unchanged, as this does not affect the loop's execution).
- `max_val` is negative infinity (unchanged, as this does not affect the loop's execution).

For the loop to execute, the list `a` must contain at least one element.

State: **`a` must contain at least one element**
