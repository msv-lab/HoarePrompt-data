The code `max_val = num` updates the value of `max_val` to be equal to `num`. Given the initial state, `num` is either greater than or less than `min_val`, and `max_val` is the maximum value between the original `max_val` and `num`.

- If `num` is greater than `max_val`, then `max_val` remains unchanged because the new value of `max_val` is set to `num`.
- If `num` is less than or equal to `max_val`, then `max_val` is updated to `num`.

Given this logic, the updated `max_val` will be the maximum of the original `max_val` and `num`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + 1 + 2*n:idx + 1 + 3*n]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 2 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is now `num` if `num < min_val`, `max_val` is the maximum of the original `max_val` and `num`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`, and `data[idx + 1 + 2*n:idx + 1 + 3*n]` must contain at least one element.**
