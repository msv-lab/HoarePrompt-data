The value of `idx` is incremented by `1 + n_val`. Since `n_val` is the same as `n`, the value of `idx` becomes `idx + 1 + n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`**
