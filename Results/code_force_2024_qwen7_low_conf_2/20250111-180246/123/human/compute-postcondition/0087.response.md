The given code snippet is printing the elements of the `results` list, which already contains values calculated previously. No new assignments or changes to variables are made within this code snippet. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `results` is a list containing the values `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for each iteration, `idx` is equal to its original value plus `t` times `(1 + n)`, `n` is the `n` value from the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + (t-1)*n:idx + t*n]` and contains at least one element, `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`. The print statement executes and outputs the elements of the `results` list, each on a new line.**
