`idx` is incremented by the value of `n`. Since `n` is the second element of `data`, and `data` is a list of strings, `n` is a string. However, `idx` is an integer, and adding a string to an integer is not a valid operation in Python, which would result in a TypeError. But assuming the context allows us to interpret this as an integer addition (for the sake of this exercise), we proceed with the interpretation that `idx` is updated to its current value plus the integer value of the second element of `data`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `n` is the second element of `data`
- `data` is a list of strings
- `idx` is 2
- `results` is an empty list
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the sliced part of `data` to integers

Since the exact value of `n` is not provided, we keep it as `n` in the output.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is `2 + int(n)`, `results` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the sliced part of `data` to integers**
