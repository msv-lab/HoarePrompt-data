To understand the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information given and analyze it step by step.

### Initial Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:** 
  - `a` contains at least one element.
  - `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`.
  - If `num` is greater than `max_val`, then `max_val` is set to `num`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.

### Key Points:
- The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`.
- `min_val` is already determined based on the initial elements of `a`.
- `max_val` is updated during each iteration if the current `num` is greater than the current `max_val`.

### Analysis:
- Since we are considering the state at the end of the previous iteration, `num` is the last element processed in the list `a`.
- `max_val` will be updated to this last `num` if `num` is greater than the current `max_val`.
- For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more element in the list `a` to process.

### Adjusted States:
- The number of elements in `a` must be at least 2 because we already processed one element in the previous iteration.
- The new `num` will be the second element in the list `a`.
- `max_val` will either remain unchanged or be updated to this new `num` depending on its value.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` contains at least two elements, `min_val` is the minimum value within the first element of `a`, `max_val` is either the same as the previous `max_val` or equal to the second element in `a` if it is greater.**
