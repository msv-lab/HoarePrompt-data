`max_val` is assigned the value of `num`. Since `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` now holds the value of `num`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` contains at least one element, and `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`; `max_val` is equal to `num`.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, and `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`; `max_val` is equal to `num`**
