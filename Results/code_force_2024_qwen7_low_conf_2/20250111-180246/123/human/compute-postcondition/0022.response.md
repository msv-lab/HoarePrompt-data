The code sets `max_val` to the value of `num`. The value of `num` is not specified in the initial state, but we know that `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`. The value of `min_val` does not change because the code does not update it. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` contains at least one element, and `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`; `max_val` is set to `num`.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, and `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`; `max_val` is set to `num`**
