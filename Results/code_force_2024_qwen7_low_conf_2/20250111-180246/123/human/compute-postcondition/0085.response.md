The code snippet `results.append(max_expression_value)` appends the value of `max_expression_value` to the list `results`. Given the initial state, `max_expression_value` is defined as `4 * (max_val - min_val)`. This value is then added to the list `results`.

- `a` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it.
- `idx` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it.
- `t` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it.
- `min_val` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it.
- `max_val` remains unchanged because no operation was performed on it.
- `max_expression_value` remains the same as `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.
- `results` now includes the value `max_expression_value` appended to it.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + 2*n:idx + 3*n]` that must contain at least one element.
- `idx` is equal to its original value plus 3 plus 2 times `n`.
- `t` is greater than 1.
- `min_val` is the minimum value among all elements in `a`.
- `max_val` is the maximum value among all elements in `a`.
- `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.
- `results` is a list containing the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it.
- `n` is `n_val`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + 2*n:idx + 3*n]` that must contain at least one element; `idx` is equal to its original value plus 3 plus 2 times `n`; `t` is greater than 1; `min_val` is the minimum value among all elements in `a`; `max_val` is the maximum value among all elements in `a`; `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`; `results` is a list containing the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it; `n` is `n_val`**.
