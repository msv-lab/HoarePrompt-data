The code assigns the value of `num` to `min_val`. Given the initial state where `num` is a value less than `min_val`, this assignment means that `min_val` now holds the value of `num`. The other variables (`a` and `num`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, `num` is a value less than `min_val`, and `min_val` is now equal to `num`.**
