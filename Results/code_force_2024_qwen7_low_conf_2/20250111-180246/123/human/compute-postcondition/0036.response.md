`idx` is increased by `n`. The value of `idx` was previously increased by 1, so now it is increased by an additional `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is the list of integers obtained by converting `data[idx:idx + n]` to integers, `min_val` is the minimum value within the new list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value within the new list `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 \(\times\) (`max_val` - `min_val`), `results` is a list containing the value 4 \(\times\) (`max_val` - `min_val`), `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`.**
