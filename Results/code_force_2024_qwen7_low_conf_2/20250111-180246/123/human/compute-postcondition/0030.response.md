The code assigns the value of `4 * (max_val - min_val)` to `max_expression_value`. This calculation uses the current values of `max_val` and `min_val` from the initial state. Since these values are known but not explicitly stated in the problem, let's denote them as they were in the initial state.

- `max_val` is the maximum value within the list `a`.
- `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`.

After executing the line of code, `max_expression_value` will hold the calculated value based on these two variables.

Output State: **`a` contains all elements from the original list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value within the list `a`, and `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val).**
