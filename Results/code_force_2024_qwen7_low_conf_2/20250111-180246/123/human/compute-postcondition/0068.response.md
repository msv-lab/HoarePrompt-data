The code sets `min_val` to the value of `num`. Given the initial conditions:

- `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`
- `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`
- `t` is greater than 1
- `min_val` is the new minimum value found including `num`, which now equals `num`
- `max_val` remains the same
- `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`
- `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it
- `n` is `n_val`
- `data[idx:idx + n]` must contain at least one element
- The current value of `num` is less than `min_val`

After setting `min_val = num`, the updated state is:

- `min_val` is now equal to `num`
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is equal to `num`, `max_val` remains the same, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`, and `data[idx:idx + n]` must contain at least one element.**
