The given code `input = sys.stdin.read` reassigns the `input` function to `sys.stdin.read`. This means that instead of using the standard `input` function, the program will now read all input data from `sys.stdin` as a single string. However, this code does not immediately execute any input or modify any variable values directly. It only changes the way input is read later in the program.

Output State: **t is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 500; for each test case, n is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100; the second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n such that -10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6; the input function is reassigned to `sys.stdin.read`**
