Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The loop is iterating over the list `a`, where `a` contains at least one element, and `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `num` is greater than `max_val` (which is equal to `num` in this case), then `min_val` remains unchanged.
   - Otherwise, if `num` is less than `min_val`, `min_val` is updated to `num`.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `a` contains at least one element.
   - `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`.

5. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the current `num` being processed should be the next element in the list `a`.
   - Since `min_val` was updated based on the current `num` during the previous iteration, it might or might not be the same as the previous `min_val` depending on the value of `num`.

Given the above points, let's adjust the states for the next iteration:

- `a` still contains at least one element (since we are iterating through the list).
- `min_val` could either remain the same or be updated to the new `num` if `num` is less than the current `min_val`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

**`a` contains at least one element, and `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`**.

Since the exact value of `min_val` is not specified without knowing the actual values in `a` and the current `num`, we only update the general conditions.

State: **`a` contains at least one element, and `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`**.
