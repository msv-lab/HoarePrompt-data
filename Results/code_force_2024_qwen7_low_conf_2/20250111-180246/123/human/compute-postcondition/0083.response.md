Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + 2*n:idx + 3*n]` that must contain at least one element, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 3 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is the minimum value among all elements in `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value among all elements in `a`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list containing the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`.**
