The code calculates `max_expression_value` as `4 * (max_val - min_val)`. This does not affect the values of `a`, `idx`, `t`, `min_val`, and `max_val` directly, but it assigns a new value to `max_expression_value`.

- `a` remains a list of integers with at least one element.
- `idx` remains increased by `1 + n`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `min_val` remains the minimum value in the list `a`.
- `max_val` remains the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `max_expression_value` is now `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val)**
