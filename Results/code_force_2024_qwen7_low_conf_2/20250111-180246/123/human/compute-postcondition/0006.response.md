The code assigns the value of `data[idx]` to `n`. Since `idx` is 1, `n` is assigned the second element of the list `data`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the second element of `data`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input by whitespace, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the second element of `data`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input by whitespace, `idx` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
