The code assigns the value of `num` to `min_val`. However, since `num` is not defined in the initial state and there is no new assignment to `num` in the given code snippet, it's unclear what the exact value of `num` is. Given that `min_val` was initially the minimum value within the list `a`, the updated state would reflect that `min_val` is now set to the value of `num`.

Since the initial state only tells us that `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`, and there's no additional information about `num`, we can only conclude that `min_val` is reassigned to `num`.

Output State: **`a` contains at least one element, and `min_val` is the value of `num`.**
