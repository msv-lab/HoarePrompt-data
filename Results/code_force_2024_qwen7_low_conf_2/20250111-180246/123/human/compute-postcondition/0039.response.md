Let's analyze the given scenario step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[idx:idx + n]` to integers.
   - `min_val` is set to infinity.
   - `max_val` is set to negative infinity.
   - `max_expression_value` is set to \(4 \times (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val})\), which is currently 4 \(\times\) (negative infinity - infinity) = undefined but logically should be 0 since max_val and min_val are at their initial extreme values.
   - `results` is a list containing the value 4 \(\times\) (\(\text{max_val} - \text{min_val}\)), which is currently 0.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`.

2. **For Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each `num` in `a`.

3. **Loop Execution Requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute, `a` must contain at least one element (since we are iterating over `num` in `a`). This ensures there is at least one number to process.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - `a` must have at least one element to ensure the loop body runs.
   - `idx` must be increased by 1 + `n`, as mentioned in the initial state.
   - `t > 0` remains unchanged and does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

5. **Summary**:
   - `a` must have at least one element.
   - `idx` must be increased by 1 + `n`.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the final state adjustments required for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 0**.
