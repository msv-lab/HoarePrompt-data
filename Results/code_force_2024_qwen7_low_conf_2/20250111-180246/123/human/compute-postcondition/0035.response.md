The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` changes the value of `a` by converting a slice of the list `data` starting from index `idx` and of length `n` into a list of integers. However, the initial values of `a`, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, `results`, `t`, and `idx` are not specified in detail. We know that `a` originally contained all elements from the original list of integers, and now it is updated to this new list of integers.

Let's break it down:

1. The slice `data[idx:idx + n]` is converted to a list of integers using `map(int, ...)` and assigned back to `a`.
2. This means `a` now holds the new list of integers, and the values of `min_val` and `max_val` will be recalculated based on this new list.
3. `max_expression_value` is recalculated as `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.
4. `results` remains unchanged, containing the list `[4 * (max_val - min_val)]`.
5. `t` is unaffected.
6. `idx` is increased by 1.

Given these points, we can construct the output state:

Output State: **`a` is the list of integers obtained by converting `data[idx:idx + n]` to integers, `min_val` is the minimum value within the new list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value within the new list `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 \(\times\) (`max_val` - `min_val`), `results` is a list containing the value 4 \(\times\) (`max_val` - `min_val`), `t` must be greater than 0, `idx` is increased by 1.**
