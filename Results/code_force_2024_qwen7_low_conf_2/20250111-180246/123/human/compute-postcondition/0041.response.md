`min_val` is assigned the value of `num`. The value of `num` is less than `min_val`, so after this assignment, `min_val` will be equal to `num`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers that must have at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` must be greater than 0, and `min_val` is equal to `num`**
