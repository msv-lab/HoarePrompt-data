Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`.
   - `idx` is equal to its original value plus 1 plus 2 times `n`.
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `min_val` is the minimum value among the elements in `a`.
   - `max_val` is either the original `max_val` or the current value of `num` if `num > max_val`.
   - `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.
   - `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it.
   - `n` is `n_val`.
   - `data[idx:idx + n]` must contain at least one element.

2. **Understand the loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`.

3. **Determine the changes needed for the next iteration:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, the list `a` must still have elements.
   - Since `a` is derived from `data[idx:idx + n]`, the next iteration would use `data[idx + 1:idx + n + 1]`.
   - `idx` is updated to `idx + 1 + 2 * n`.

4. **Adjust the states:**
   - `idx` will be updated to `idx + 1 + 2 * n`.
   - `a` will be updated to `data[idx:idx + n]` with `idx` incremented as described.
   - `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, and `results` will be recalculated based on the new list `a`.

Based on the above reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

- `idx` is updated to `idx + 1 + 2 * n`.
- `a` is derived from `data[idx:idx + n]` and must contain at least one element.

The other states (`t`, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, `results`, `n`, and the condition on `data`) remain unchanged as they do not directly affect the loop continuation.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + 1 + 2*n:idx + 1 + 3*n]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 2 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is the minimum value among the elements in `a`, `max_val` is either the original `max_val` or the current value of `num` if `num > max_val`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`, and `data[idx + 1 + 2*n:idx + 1 + 3*n]` must contain at least one element.**
