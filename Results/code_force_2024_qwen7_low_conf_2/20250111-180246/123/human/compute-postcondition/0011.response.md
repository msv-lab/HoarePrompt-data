The code sets `max_val` to negative infinity. This does not affect the values of `t`, `idx`, `results`, `a`, `min_val`, `data`, or `n`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `max_val`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1; `idx` is `2 + int(n)'; `results` is an empty list; `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the sliced part of `data` to integers; `min_val` is positive infinity; `max_val` is negative infinity.**
