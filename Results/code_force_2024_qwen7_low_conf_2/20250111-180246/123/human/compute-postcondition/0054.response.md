The code `max_val = num` updates the value of `max_val` to the current value of `num`. However, the initial state also includes conditions related to `min_val` and `max_val` being updated based on the next `num`. Since the code does not reference `min_val` or the next `num`, only `max_val` is directly affected.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `min_val` is equal to the minimum value between `min_val` and the next `num`.
- If the next `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is now equal to the next `num`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.

The code simply sets `max_val` to the current value of `num`, regardless of the previous conditions. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `min_val` is equal to the minimum value between `min_val` and the next `num`, `max_val` is equal to `num`.**
