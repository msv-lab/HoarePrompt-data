The code `max_val = num` updates the value of `max_val` to the current value of `num`. The other variables (`a`, `idx`, `t`, `min_val`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated values are:

- `max_val` is now equal to `num`
- The other variables retain their previous states.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `min_val` is updated to `num` if `num` is less than the current `min_val`, and `max_val` is now equal to `num`.**
