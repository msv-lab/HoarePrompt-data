According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were true:
- `a` is a list of integers with at least one element.
- `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`.
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`.
- `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`.
- `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val).
- `results` is a list with the value 4 * (max_val - min_val) appended to it.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be decremented by 1 but still remain greater than 0. Therefore, `t` will be `t - 1`.

The other states remain unchanged as they do not depend on the loop condition.

State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 * (max_val - min_val), `results` is a list with the value 4 * (max_val - min_val) appended to it**
