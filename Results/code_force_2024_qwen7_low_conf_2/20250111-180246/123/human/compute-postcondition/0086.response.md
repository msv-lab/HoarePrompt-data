Output State: **`t` is the number of iterations the loop has executed, `results` is a list containing the values `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for each iteration, `idx` is equal to its original value plus `t` times `(1 + n)`, `n` is the `n` value from the last iteration, `a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + (t-1)*n:idx + t*n]` and contains at least one element, `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`, and `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the value of the first element in the `data` list converted to an integer.
- For each iteration, the loop processes a sublist of `data` of length `n`, updates `min_val` and `max_val` based on the values in this sublist, and appends `4 * (max_val - min_val)` to the `results` list.
- After `t` iterations, `idx` will be updated to its original value plus the sum of `1 + n` for each iteration, which is `t * (1 + n)`.
- `n` retains the value it had in the last iteration.
- `a` is a list of integers derived from the sublists of `data` processed during each iteration.
- `min_val` and `max_val` are the minimum and maximum values found in the list `a` for the last iteration.
- `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)` for the last iteration.
