The code `t = int(data[0])` assigns the first element of the list `data`, converted to an integer, to the variable `t`. Since `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input by whitespace, the first element of `data` is a string representation of an integer. This string is then converted to an integer and assigned to `t`. The values of `n` and `data` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` (converted to an integer), `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input by whitespace**
