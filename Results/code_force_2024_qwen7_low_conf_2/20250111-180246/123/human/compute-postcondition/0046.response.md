Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers with at least one element.
   - `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`.
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `min_val` is updated to `num` if `num` is less than the current `min_val`.
   - If `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is now equal to `num`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the state just before the start of the next iteration.

4. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as there are elements left in the list `a`.

5. **Updating Variables**:
   - Each time an element `num` is processed, `idx` is incremented by 1 + `n`.
   - `min_val` is updated based on the current `num`.
   - `max_val` is updated if `num` is greater than the current `max_val`.

6. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to continue, `a` must still have elements.
   - `idx` will be incremented by 1 + `n` again.
   - `t` remains greater than 0 (since it was only checked at the start and not modified inside the loop).
   - `min_val` and `max_val` will be updated based on the new `num` value.

Given these points, let's formulate the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `a` must still have elements, meaning `a` is not empty.
- `idx` will be incremented by 1 + `n`.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `min_val` and `max_val` will be updated based on the next `num` in the list.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by 1 + `n`, `t` is greater than 0, `min_val` is updated to `num` if `num` is less than the current `min_val`, and if `num` is greater than `max_val`, `max_val` is now equal to `num`. Otherwise, `max_val` remains unchanged.**
