The code snippet `a = list(map(int, data[idx:idx + n]))` impacts the following:

- It slices the list `data` from index `idx` to `idx + n`.
- It converts each element in the sliced list to an integer using `map(int, ...)` and then converts the map object to a list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `n` is the second element of `data`
- `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input by whitespace
- `idx` is 2
- `results` is an empty list

Let's denote the elements of `data` as `data[0]`, `data[1]`, `data[2]`, etc.

Since `n` is the second element of `data`, let's denote it as `n = data[1]`. 

Then the slice `data[idx:idx + n]` would be `data[2:2 + n]` which translates to `data[2:2+n]`.

So, `a = list(map(int, data[2:2 + n]))` will convert the sliced list of strings to integers.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables after executing the code is:
- `t` must be greater than or equal to 1
- `n` remains the same (the second element of `data`)
- `data` remains the same (unchanged)
- `idx` remains 2
- `results` remains an empty list
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the sliced part of `data` to integers

Output State: **`t` must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is the second element of `data`, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input by whitespace, `idx` is 2, `results` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers obtained from converting the sliced part of `data` to integers**
