The code `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the integer value of `data[idx]` to the variable `n`. The other variables (`a`, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, `results`, and `t`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`a` contains all elements from the original list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value within the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value within the list `a`, `max_expression_value` is 4 \(\times\) (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val}), `results` is a list containing the value 4 \(\times\) (\text{max_val} - \text{min_val}), `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`**
