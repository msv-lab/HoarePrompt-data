The code `min_val = num` updates the value of `min_val` to be the current value of `num`. The previous value of `min_val` was the minimum value among the elements in the list `a`, but now it is updated to be `num`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers derived from `data[idx + 1 + 2*n:idx + 1 + 3*n]`, `idx` is equal to its original value plus 2 plus 2 times `n`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is now `num`, `max_val` is either the original `max_val` or the current value of `num` if `num > max_val`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`, and `data[idx + 1 + 2*n:idx + 1 + 3*n]` must contain at least one element.**
