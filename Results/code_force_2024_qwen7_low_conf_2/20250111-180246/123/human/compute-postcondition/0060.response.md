The code snippet assigns the value from `data[idx]` to the variable `n`. Since `idx` is increased by `1 + n`, the value of `idx` changes, and `n` is assigned the value from `data[idx]`. The other variables (`a`, `t`, `min_val`, `max_val`, `max_expression_value`, and `results`) are not affected.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers with at least one element
- `idx` is increased by `1 + n`
- `t` is greater than 1
- `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`
- `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`
- `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`
- `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it

Let's denote the value from `data[idx]` as `n_val`. After executing the code:
- `idx` is updated to `idx + 1 + n_val`
- `n` is assigned the value `n_val`

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers with at least one element, `idx` is increased by `1 + n_val`, `t` is greater than 1, `min_val` is the minimum value in the list `a`, `max_val` is the maximum value in the list `a`, `max_expression_value` is `4 * (max_val - min_val)`, `results` is a list with the value `4 * (max_val - min_val)` appended to it, `n` is `n_val`**
