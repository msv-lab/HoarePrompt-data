The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `idx`. The initial values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged, and `data` remains a list of strings resulting from splitting the input by whitespace.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to `data[0]` (converted to an integer), `n` is an integer such that 4 <= n <= 100, `data` is a list of strings resulting from splitting the input by whitespace, `idx` is 1**
