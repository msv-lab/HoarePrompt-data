The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition (`def func_1():`). However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, it seems the function is expected to handle input data similar to a problem involving multiple test cases, where each test case includes an integer `t` and a series of integers `n`.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that `1 <= t <= 500`.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that `4 <= n <= 100`.
- The second line of each test case contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` such that `-10^6 <= a_i <= 10^6`.

The output involves processing `t` test cases, each containing `n` integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but processes `t` test cases, each consisting of an integer `n` followed by `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`, and returns results based on the processed data.**
