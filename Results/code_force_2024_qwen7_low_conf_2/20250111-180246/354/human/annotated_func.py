    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a 2D list with `max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1` rows and 4 columns, `dp[i][j]` for `0 <= j < 4` and `0 <= i <= max(c1, c2, c3, c4)` contains the value computed according to the rules inside the loop, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4 <= 10^6` and the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` for each test case does not exceed `4 * 10^6`, and `MOD` is `998244353`.

    #The program returns total_ways which is the sum of the last row of dp modulo 998244353
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`, where each parameter is constrained to be between 0 and \(10^6\) inclusive, and their sum does not exceed \(4 \times 10^6\). It computes a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a sum `i` using a combination of elements from `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. Each element can be used multiple times. After populating the `dp` table, the function returns the sum of the last row of the `dp` table modulo \(998244353\).

The function correctly handles all provided annotations and includes the following steps:
1. Initializes a `dp` table with dimensions `(max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) x 4`.
2. Sets the base case `dp[0][0] = 1` to indicate one way to achieve a sum of 0 without any elements.
3. Iterates through each possible sum up to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, updating the `dp` table based on whether the current sum can be achieved using `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4`.
4. Computes the total number of ways to achieve the maximum sum (`max(c1, c2, c3, c4)`) by summing the values in the last row of the `dp` table.
5. Returns the total number of ways modulo \(998244353\).

Potential edge cases:
- If any of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4` is 0, the corresponding entries in the `dp` table will not be updated beyond the initial base case.
- If the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` exceeds \(4 \times 10^6\), the function will still execute but the constraints are not violated, so the computation is valid.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, c1, c2, c3, and c4 are integers representing the number of elements of each type, where 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4 <= 10^6. The sum of c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 for all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^6.
def func_2():
    MOD = 998244353
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        c1, c2, c3, c4 = map(int, input().split())

        results.append(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the last iteration (when `t` is reached).
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `results` is a list with exactly `t` elements, and the loop prints the list `results`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers \(c1\), \(c2\), \(c3\), and \(c4\). For each test case, it calls `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` to compute a result, which is then appended to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case. The function ensures that the input values are within specified limits (i.e., \(0 \leq c1, c2, c3, c4 \leq 10^6\) and the sum of \(c1 + c2 + c3 + c4\) for all test cases does not exceed \(4 \times 10^6\)). If any test case violates these constraints, the function will raise an error due to the input validation performed by `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`. The function also uses a constant `MOD` (998244353) in the computation, ensuring that all intermediate and final results are taken modulo `MOD`.
