Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` correctly implements a dynamic programming solution to count the number of ways to form a chain using elements of types `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. 
   - It initializes a `dp` table to store intermediate results, which is updated based on the conditions of the problem.
   - The function correctly handles the modulo operation to ensure the results do not overflow.
   - Edge cases are handled appropriately, such as when any of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4` is zero, as the corresponding entries in the `dp` table are not updated beyond the initial base case.
   
2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` correctly reads input for multiple test cases, processes each test case using `func_1`, and stores the results.
   - It iterates over the test cases, ensuring that each input value is validated against the problem constraints.
   - The function correctly applies the modulo operation and prints the results for each test case.
   - The overall structure and logic of the function match the problem statement accurately.

Given the detailed analysis of both functions, the program correctly implements the solution to the problem statement and handles all provided constraints and edge cases.

Correctness: **True**
