### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The problem requires us to form a single continuous chain using four types of elements (A, B, C, D) where each type has a specific connection rule. The elements of the same type cannot be directly connected but must alternate between different types with complementary connections.
   - The goal is to calculate the number of valid ways to arrange these elements.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - The solution uses dynamic programming to track the number of ways to form chains ending with a specific type of element.
   - The `dp` table is initialized such that `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a chain of length `i` ending with type `j`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function initializes a `dp` table with dimensions `(max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) x 4`.
   - It sets the base case `dp[0][0] = 1`, indicating one way to use zero elements.
   - For each element count from 1 to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, it updates the `dp` table by considering all possible ways to add the next element while ensuring that the connection rules are followed.
   - The final answer is the sum of all ways to use all available elements (`sum(dp[max(c1, c2, c3, c4)])`).

4. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function reads the number of test cases and processes each one using `func_1`.
   - It prints the results for each test case, ensuring that the input values are within the specified limits.

5. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The solution handles the constraints effectively by ensuring that the input values are non-negative and do not exceed the specified limits.
   - The modulo operation (`% MOD`) ensures that the intermediate and final results remain within a manageable range.

6. **Validation with Function Summaries**:
   - The function summary confirms that `func_1` correctly computes the number of valid arrangements for a single test case.
   - `func_2` correctly processes multiple test cases and prints the results as expected.

### Conclusion:
Based on the detailed analysis and the function summaries provided, the implementation appears to correctly address the problem statement. The logic in `func_1` ensures that all constraints and conditions are met, and `func_2` handles multiple test cases efficiently.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
