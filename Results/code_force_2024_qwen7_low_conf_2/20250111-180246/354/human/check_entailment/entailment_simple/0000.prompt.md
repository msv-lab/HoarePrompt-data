You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You have a one-dimensional puzzle, all the elements of which need to be put in
one row, connecting with each other. All the puzzle elements are completely
white and distinguishable from each other only if they have different shapes.

Each element has straight borders at the top and bottom, and on the left and
right it has connections, each of which can be a protrusion or a recess. You
cannot rotate the elements.

You can see that there are exactly 4 types of elements. Two elements can be
connected if the right connection of the left element is opposite to the left
connection of the right element.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/3a4ca20f32b3885d01c9dc80911de1cfb06870fe.png)
All possible types of elements.

The puzzle contains c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 elements of each type. The puzzle is
considered complete if you have managed to combine all elements into one long
chain. You want to know how many ways this can be done.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The description of each test case contains 4 integers c_i (0 \le c_i \le 10^6
) — the number of elements of each type, respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of c_i for all test cases does not exceed 4
\cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of possible ways to solve
the puzzle.

Two methods are considered different if there is i , such that the types of
elements at the i position in these methods differ.

Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 998244353 .

If it is impossible to solve the puzzle, print 0 .

This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: c1, c2, c3, and c4 are non-negative integers such that 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4 <= 10^6, and the sum of c1, c2, c3, and c4 for each test case does not exceed 4 * 10^6.
def func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4):
    MOD = 998244353
    dp = [[(0) for _ in range(4)] for _ in range(max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1
    for i in range(1, max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1):
        if i <= c1:
            dp[i][0] = (dp[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][2] + dp[i - 1][3]) % MOD
        
        if i <= c2:
            dp[i][1] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][2] + dp[i - 1][3]) % MOD
        
        if i <= c3:
            dp[i][2] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][3]) % MOD
        
        if i <= c4:
            dp[i][3] = (dp[i - 1][0] + dp[i - 1][1] + dp[i - 1][2]) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a 2D list with `max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1` rows and 4 columns, `dp[i][j]` for `0 <= j < 4` and `0 <= i <= max(c1, c2, c3, c4)` contains the value computed according to the rules inside the loop, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4 <= 10^6` and the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` for each test case does not exceed `4 * 10^6`, and `MOD` is `998244353`.
    total_ways = sum(dp[max(c1, c2, c3, c4)]) % MOD
    return total_ways
    #The program returns total_ways which is the sum of the last row of dp modulo 998244353

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, c1, c2, c3, and c4 are integers representing the number of elements of each type, where 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4 <= 10^6. The sum of c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 for all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^6.
def func_2():
    MOD = 998244353
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        c1, c2, c3, c4 = map(int, input().split())
        
        result = func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the last iteration (when `t` is reached).
    for result in results:
        print(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `results` is a list with exactly `t` elements, and the loop prints the list `results`.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
