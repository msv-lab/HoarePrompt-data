Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case individually. It correctly handles multiple test cases as specified.

2. **State Initialization:**
   - The state variables `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are initialized based on the input for each test case. These variables represent the number of elements of each type, and their values are within the specified range (`0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4 <= 10^6`).

3. **Dynamic Programming Table Construction:**
   - The function `func_1` constructs a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to form a chain of length `i` ending with the `j-th` type of element. The transitions in the DP table correctly account for the conditions where an element can be placed next to another based on their connections.
   - The initialization `dp[0][0] = 1` ensures that there is exactly one way to start the chain with no elements.

4. **Final Calculation:**
   - After filling the DP table, the program sums up the values in the last row of `dp` to get the total number of ways to form a complete chain using all elements. The result is taken modulo `998244353` as required by the problem statement.

5. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - The program correctly handles cases where one or more types of elements are missing (e.g., `0 0 566 239`). When all types of elements are zero, the function returns `1` (as expected), and for cases where a specific type is zero, it ensures that no invalid chains are formed.

6. **Output Formatting:**
   - The program outputs the results for each test case as required, ensuring that the output matches the problem's format.

Given that the program correctly initializes its state, performs the necessary calculations using dynamic programming, and outputs the results in the specified format, it fully adheres to the problem description provided. Therefore, the program is correct.
