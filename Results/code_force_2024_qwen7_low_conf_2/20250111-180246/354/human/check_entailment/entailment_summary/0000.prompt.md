You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You have a one-dimensional puzzle, all the elements of which need to be put in
one row, connecting with each other. All the puzzle elements are completely
white and distinguishable from each other only if they have different shapes.

Each element has straight borders at the top and bottom, and on the left and
right it has connections, each of which can be a protrusion or a recess. You
cannot rotate the elements.

You can see that there are exactly 4 types of elements. Two elements can be
connected if the right connection of the left element is opposite to the left
connection of the right element.

![](https://espresso.codeforces.com/3a4ca20f32b3885d01c9dc80911de1cfb06870fe.png)
All possible types of elements.

The puzzle contains c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4 elements of each type. The puzzle is
considered complete if you have managed to combine all elements into one long
chain. You want to know how many ways this can be done.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the
number of input test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The description of each test case contains 4 integers c_i (0 \le c_i \le 10^6
) — the number of elements of each type, respectively.

It is guaranteed that the sum of c_i for all test cases does not exceed 4
\cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the number of possible ways to solve
the puzzle.

Two methods are considered different if there is i , such that the types of
elements at the i position in these methods differ.

Since the answer can be very large, output it modulo 998244353 .

If it is impossible to solve the puzzle, print 0 .

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts four non-negative integer parameters `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`, where each parameter is constrained to be between 0 and \(10^6\) inclusive, and their sum does not exceed \(4 \times 10^6\). It computes a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a sum `i` using a combination of elements from `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. Each element can be used multiple times. After populating the `dp` table, the function returns the sum of the last row of the `dp` table modulo \(998244353\).

The function correctly handles all provided annotations and includes the following steps:
1. Initializes a `dp` table with dimensions `(max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) x 4`.
2. Sets the base case `dp[0][0] = 1` to indicate one way to achieve a sum of 0 without any elements.
3. Iterates through each possible sum up to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, updating the `dp` table based on whether the current sum can be achieved using `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4`.
4. Computes the total number of ways to achieve the maximum sum (`max(c1, c2, c3, c4)`) by summing the values in the last row of the `dp` table.
5. Returns the total number of ways modulo \(998244353\).

Potential edge cases:
- If any of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4` is 0, the corresponding entries in the `dp` table will not be updated beyond the initial base case.
- If the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` exceeds \(4 \times 10^6\), the function will still execute but the constraints are not violated, so the computation is valid.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2():
    MOD = 998244353
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        (c1, c2, c3, c4) = map(int, input().split())
        result = func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers \(c1\), \(c2\), \(c3\), and \(c4\). For each test case, it calls `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` to compute a result, which is then appended to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case. The function ensures that the input values are within specified limits (i.e., \(0 \leq c1, c2, c3, c4 \leq 10^6\) and the sum of \(c1 + c2 + c3 + c4\) for all test cases does not exceed \(4 \times 10^6\)). If any test case violates these constraints, the function will raise an error due to the input validation performed by `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`. The function also uses a constant `MOD` (998244353) in the computation, ensuring that all intermediate and final results are taken modulo `MOD`.
