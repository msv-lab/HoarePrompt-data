Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - This function uses dynamic programming to calculate the number of ways to arrange the puzzle elements based on the given counts `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`.
   - It correctly initializes the DP table `dp` with dimensions `(max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1) x 4`.
   - It sets the base case `dp[0][0] = 1` which is necessary to account for the possibility of having zero elements.
   - It iterates over each possible sum up to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)` and updates the DP table based on whether the current sum can be achieved using `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, or `c4`.
   - Finally, it sums the last row of the DP table to get the total number of ways to achieve the maximum sum modulo `998244353`.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - This function reads the number of test cases `t` and processes each test case by calling `func_1` with the given counts `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`.
   - It ensures that the input values are within the specified limits and appends the results of each test case to a list `results`.
   - It then prints the results for each test case.

Given the detailed execution summaries and the problem description, both functions seem to correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Function `func_1` calculates the number of ways to arrange the puzzle elements correctly using dynamic programming, and function `func_2` processes multiple test cases and prints the results accordingly.

Therefore, since both functions work correctly according to the problem description and the provided execution summaries, the overall program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
