Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided solution seems to correctly implement the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem of counting the number of ways to connect all puzzle pieces into one long chain. The function `func_1` initializes a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to arrange `i` elements ending with the `j`-th type of element. The transitions in the DP table ensure that the conditions for connecting elements are met. The function `func_2` reads the input and uses `func_1` to compute the result for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the nature of the solution, it appears that the code handles all valid cases correctly. The modular arithmetic ensures that the results are within the required bounds. There are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that the provided code does not handle. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
