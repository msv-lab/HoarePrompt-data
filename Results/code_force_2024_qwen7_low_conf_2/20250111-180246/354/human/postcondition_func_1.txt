The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of four integers \(c1\), \(c2\), \(c3\), and \(c4\). For each test case, it calls `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` to compute a result, which is then appended to a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results of each test case. The function ensures that the input values are within specified limits (i.e., \(0 \leq c1, c2, c3, c4 \leq 10^6\) and the sum of \(c1 + c2 + c3 + c4\) for all test cases does not exceed \(4 \times 10^6\)). If any test case violates these constraints, the function will raise an error due to the input validation performed by `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`. The function also uses a constant `MOD` (998244353) in the computation, ensuring that all intermediate and final results are taken modulo `MOD`.
