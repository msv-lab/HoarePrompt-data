According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` must be greater than 0, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 (since it was already greater than 0 in the previous iteration). Additionally, `results` should be updated to include the new result of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the current value of `t`.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration up to the current value of `t`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the current value of `t`**
