The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `result`, it will be appended to `results` in its current form. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration up to the next value of `t` plus the current value of `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the current value of `t` and `result` has been appended to `results`.**
