Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial State Analysis
- The number of remaining inputs is reduced by 1.
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers from the input.
- Depending on the conditions, either 0 is printed, or a specific formula is computed and printed.
- The loop continues until all inputs are processed.

### End of Previous Iteration
- At the end of the previous iteration, we have the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d`.
- We know the result of the computation based on the conditions provided.

### Loop Condition
- The loop runs for each input provided.
- The loop condition is `for _ in range(int(input()))`.

### Adjusting States for Next Iteration
- Since the loop runs based on the number of inputs, and the number of remaining inputs is reduced by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to continue, there must be at least one more input left.

### Key Points to Adjust
- The number of remaining inputs should be checked.
- The variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` should be reset for the next input.

### Updated State
- At the end of the previous iteration, the number of remaining inputs is reduced by 1, so for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more input left.
- Therefore, the number of remaining inputs should be at least 1.

Given the above points, the state adjustments for the next iteration would be:

**State: **The number of remaining inputs is at least 1, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is an integer from the input.**
