Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `results` is a list with exactly `t` elements, and the loop prints the list `results`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the list `results` and prints each element. Since the loop runs for each element in `results`, the length of `results` must be `t`.
- If `t` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `results` remains an empty list.
- If `t` is greater than 0, the loop executes `t` times, printing each element of the list `results`, which contains the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`.

Since the loop finishes executing after all iterations, the final state will reflect the full list `results` with exactly `t` elements, and the loop will have printed this list.
