The code `a, b, c, d = map(int, input().split())` takes four space-separated integers as input and assigns them to the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` respectively. Since the input is in the form of space-separated integers, the `map(int, input().split())` function will convert each input string to an integer.

The previous values of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are replaced by the new input values. All other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **The number of remaining inputs is at least 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is an integer from the input.**
