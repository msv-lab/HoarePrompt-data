The code `print(0)` simply prints the integer `0` to the console. This does not change the values of the variables `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`. The number of remaining inputs remains at least 0.

Output State: **the number of remaining inputs is at least 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is an integer from the input, the console shows `0`**
