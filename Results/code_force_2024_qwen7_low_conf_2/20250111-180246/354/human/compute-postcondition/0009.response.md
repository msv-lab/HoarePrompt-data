The function `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` is called with the values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. The result of this function call is assigned to the variable `result`. The initial state of `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration up to the current value of `t`. After this line of code executes, `result` will hold the return value of the current function call, and `results` will be updated to include this new value.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration up to the current value of `t` plus the current value of `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the current value of `t`.**
