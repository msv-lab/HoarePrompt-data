The function `func` accepts no parameters directly defined in the given code snippet. Instead, it seems to imply that the function will handle multiple test cases internally, where for each test case, it receives four non-negative integers \(c_1, c_2, c_3,\) and \(c_4\). Additionally, it receives a positive integer \(t\) (such that \(1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)) which represents the number of test cases. The function must process these inputs and return a result for each test case, with the final answer for each test case being printed modulo \(998244353\). If it is impossible to solve the puzzle for any test case, the function returns \(0\).

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters implicitly through its processing of multiple test cases, each containing four non-negative integers \(c_1, c_2, c_3, c_4\) and a positive integer \(t\), and returns the solution for each test case modulo \(998244353\), returning \(0\) if the puzzle cannot be solved.**
