The function `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` is called with the input values `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. The return value of this function call is assigned to the variable `result`. The initial state includes the values of `t`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `MOD`, and `results`.

Since `func_1` is not defined in the snippet, we assume that `func_1` returns a value based on its inputs. After the function call, `result` is updated with this return value, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration up to the next value of `t` plus the next value of `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the current value of `t`.**
