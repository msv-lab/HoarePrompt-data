The code reads four integers from the input and assigns them to `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. The values of `t`, `MOD`, and `results` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is an empty list []**
