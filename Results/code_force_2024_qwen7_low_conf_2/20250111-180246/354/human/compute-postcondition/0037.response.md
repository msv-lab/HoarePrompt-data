The function `func_1` accepts four parameters `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`. Each of these parameters is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq c1, c2, c3, c4 \leq 10^6\), and the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` for each test case does not exceed \(4 \times 10^6\). After executing the function body, the function returns `total_ways`, which is the sum of the last row of the dynamic programming table (dp) modulo 998244353.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept four non-negative integers `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`, perform some computation involving a dynamic programming approach, and return the sum of the last row of the dp table modulo 998244353.

Functionality: **The function accepts four parameters `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`, and returns the sum of the last row of the dp table modulo 998244353.**
