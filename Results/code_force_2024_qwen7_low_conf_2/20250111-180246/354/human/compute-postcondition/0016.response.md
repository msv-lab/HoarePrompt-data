Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their States**: The initial states given are:
   - `t` is a non-negative integer.
   - `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` are input integers.
   - `MOD` is 998244353.
   - `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the last iteration (when `t` is reached).

2. **Understand the Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and assigns each element to the variable `result`.

3. **Determine the Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element. This means `t` must be greater than 0, because if `t` were 0 or negative, the `results` list would be empty or not exist, and the loop would not run.
   - The loop will iterate `t` times, where `t` is the length of the `results` list minus 1.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop needs to iterate over the `results` list, the state must ensure that the list is not empty.
   - Therefore, `t` must be greater than 0.
   - Also, the `results` list should contain exactly `t` elements.

So, the required states to adjust for the loop to execute are:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `results` must be a list with exactly `t` elements.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list with exactly `t` elements**
