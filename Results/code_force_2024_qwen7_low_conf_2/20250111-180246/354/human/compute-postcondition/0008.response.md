`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration up to the current value of `t`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the current value of `t`, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer**
