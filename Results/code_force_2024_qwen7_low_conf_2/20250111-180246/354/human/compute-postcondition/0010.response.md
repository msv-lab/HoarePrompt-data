The code appends the current value of `result` to the list `results`. This means that the list `results` will contain one additional element, which is the current value of `result`.

The output state will include the updated list `results` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration up to the current value of `t` plus the current value of `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the current value of `t`, and `results` has been updated to include the current value of `result`.**
