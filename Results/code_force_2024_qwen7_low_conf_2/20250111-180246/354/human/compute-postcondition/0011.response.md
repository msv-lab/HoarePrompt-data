According to the code, the loop iterates `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are given:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `c1` is an input integer
- `c2` is an input integer
- `c3` is an input integer
- `c4` is an input integer
- `MOD` is 998244353
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration up to the current value of `t` plus the current value of `result`
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the current value of `t`
- `results` has been updated to include the current value of `result`

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:
- The variable `t` should be decremented by 1 because it represents the number of iterations remaining.
- The variable `results` should include the result of the next iteration, which means it will have one more element.

So, at the start of the next iteration:
- `t` will be `t - 1`, which is still greater than 0 since it was greater than 1 initially.
- `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` remain unchanged as they are input integers.
- `MOD` remains the same.
- `results` will have one more element added to it, but the structure remains the same.

State: **`t` is greater than 0, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration up to the next value of `t` plus the next value of `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the next value of `t`**
