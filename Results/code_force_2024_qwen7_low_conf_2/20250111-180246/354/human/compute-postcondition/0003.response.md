To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the condition specified in the `for` loop. The loop iterates `t` times, where `t` is the input integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.

Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Variable `t`:** Since the loop iterates based on the value of `t`, `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
2. **Other Variables (`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, `MOD`, `results`):** The values of these variables do not directly affect whether the loop can execute. They remain as given or will be modified within the loop body.

Based on this analysis, the necessary adjustment is to ensure `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `c1` is an integer, `c2` is an integer, `c3` is an integer, `c4` is an integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is an empty list []**
