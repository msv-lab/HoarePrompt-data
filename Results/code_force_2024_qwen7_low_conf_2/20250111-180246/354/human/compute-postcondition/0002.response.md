The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The variables `t`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `MOD` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer, `c1` is an integer, `c2` is an integer, `c3` is an integer, `c4` is an integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is an empty list []**
