Postcondition: ***The number of remaining inputs is at least 0, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers from the input. If `a` equals 0, the print output is 1 if either `c` or `d` is 0, otherwise the print output is 0. Otherwise, `f` is an array, `mod` is an integer, and `result` is the computed value based on the given formula involving the array `f` and modulo `mod`, with the value of `result` being printed.***
