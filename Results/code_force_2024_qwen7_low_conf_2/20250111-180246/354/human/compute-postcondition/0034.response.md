Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with `max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1` rows and 4 columns, `dp[i][j]` for `0 <= j < 4` and `0 <= i <= max(c1, c2, c3, c4)` contains the value computed according to the rules inside the loop, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4 <= 10^6` and the sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` for each test case does not exceed `4 * 10^6`, and `MOD` is `998244353`.**

Explanation:
- The loop updates the `dp` table based on the conditions involving `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`.
- Each row `i` of the `dp` table is updated based on the previous row `i-1` only if the index `i` is within the bounds defined by `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`.
- After all iterations, the `dp` table will contain the values calculated according to the rules inside the loop for all valid indices `i` up to `max(c1, c2, c3, c4)`.
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `max(c1, c2, c3, c4) == 0`), the `dp` table will remain as initially set, with all elements initialized to 0 except `dp[0][0]` which is 1.
