Postcondition: ***The number of remaining inputs is at least 0, `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers from the input. If the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is greater than 1, the console shows `0`. Otherwise, if `a` equals `b`, then `a` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `b`, and the value of `result` is printed based on the given formula involving the array `f` and modulo `mod`. If `a` does not equal `b`, the console shows `1` if either `c` or `d` is 0, otherwise it shows `0`.***
