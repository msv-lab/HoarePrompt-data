The code snippet sets a constant `MOD` to the value `998244353`. This value is used for modular arithmetic operations to prevent overflow. The variables `t`, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are not affected by this line of code since they are defined in the initial state and the code snippet does not interact with them.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers representing the number of elements of each type, where 0 <= `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4` <= 10^6, and `MOD` is set to 998244353.**
