The code `print(int(c == 0 or d == 0))` evaluates the boolean expression `c == 0 or d == 0` and prints the result as an integer (0 or 1). This does not change the values of `a`, `b`, `c`, or `d`. The output of this expression depends on the values of `c` and `d`.

- If `c` is 0 or `d` is 0, the expression evaluates to `True`, and `int(True)` is `1`.
- Otherwise, the expression evaluates to `False`, and `int(False)` is `0`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **the number of remaining inputs is at least 0, `a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `c` is an integer from the input, `d` is an integer from the input, print output is 1 if c is 0 or d is 0, otherwise print output is 0**
