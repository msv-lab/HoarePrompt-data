`results` is an empty list `[]`. The code appends the value of `result` to `results`. Since `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `results` will now contain this return value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`**
