The code `total_ways = sum(dp[max(c1, c2, c3, c4)]) % MOD` calculates the sum of the last row of the 2D list `dp` (which corresponds to the maximum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4`) and stores the result modulo `MOD`. No other variables are affected by this code.

Given the initial state:
- `dp` is a 2D list with `max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1` rows and 4 columns.
- `dp[i][j]` for `0 <= j < 4` and `0 <= i <= max(c1, c2, c3, c4)` contains values computed according to the rules inside the loop.
- `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4 <= 10^6`.
- The sum of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` for each test case does not exceed `4 * 10^6`.
- `MOD` is `998244353`.

After running the given code, `total_ways` is updated to the sum of the last row of `dp` (which is `dp[max(c1, c2, c3, c4)]`) modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp` is a 2D list with `max(c1, c2, c3, c4) + 1` rows and 4 columns, `total_ways` is the sum of the last row of `dp` modulo `998244353`.**
