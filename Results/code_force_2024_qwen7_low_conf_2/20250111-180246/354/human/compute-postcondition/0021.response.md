The code `print(results)` prints the value of the variable `results`. However, the value of `results` itself does not change due to this print statement. Therefore, the only impact is the output of the program, which will display the current value of `results`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1; `results` is a list with exactly `t-1` elements; prints the list `results`**
