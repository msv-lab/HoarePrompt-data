According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t` and the list `results`. The loop iterates over each element in the list `results`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `results` is a list with exactly `t` elements.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 0, and the list `results` must still contain exactly `t` elements.

However, since the loop iterates over all elements in `results`, after each iteration, `t` decreases by 1 (because each element is processed once). Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `t` should be `t - 1`.

Given that `t` was greater than 0 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1. After processing one more element, `t` will be `t - 1`, which means it must be greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `t` must be greater than 1.
- `results` must still contain exactly `t` elements.

State: **`t` must be greater than 1, `results` is a list with exactly `t` elements**
