The code `print(results)` simply prints the contents of the list `results`. This does not modify the value of any variables; it only outputs the existing value of `results`. The precondition that `t` must be greater than 0 and `results` is a list with exactly `t` elements remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `results` is a list with exactly `t` elements**
