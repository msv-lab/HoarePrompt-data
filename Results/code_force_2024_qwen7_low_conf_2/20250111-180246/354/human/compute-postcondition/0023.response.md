The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly. However, based on the constraints, it seems that the function is intended to process multiple test cases, where each test case includes four integers (c1, c2, c3, c4) representing the number of elements of each type. The function will handle these test cases according to the given constraints.

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated, we focus on the parameters and their nature:

- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are integers representing the number of elements of each type, with constraints 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4 <= 10^6 and the sum of c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 for all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^6.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a parameter `t`, which represents the number of test cases, and for each test case, it processes integers c1, c2, c3, and c4. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it processes integers c1, c2, c3, and c4, where 0 <= c1, c2, c3, c4 <= 10^6 and the sum of c1 + c2 + c3 + c4 for all test cases does not exceed 4 * 10^6.**
