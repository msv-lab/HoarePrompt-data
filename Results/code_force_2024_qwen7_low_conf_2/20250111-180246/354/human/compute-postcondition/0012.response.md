`c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are assigned the values of the integers entered by the user using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `t`, `MOD`, `results`, and `result` remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration up to the next value of `t` plus the next value of `result`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the next value of `t`, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer**
