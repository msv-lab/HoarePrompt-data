Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that `t` is greater than 1, and `results` is a list with exactly `t` elements.

2. **Loop Structure**: The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. Each element in `results` is referred to as `result`.

3. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one element left in the `results` list to iterate over.

4. **Adjusting States**: Since `t` is the length of the `results` list, and `t` is greater than 1, the loop will continue until all elements in `results` are processed. After the last iteration, `t` will be 1 (since the list was initially `t` elements long and one element has been processed).

5. **Final State Before Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must still be greater than 1, and `results` must still have at least one element remaining to be processed.

6. **Conclusion**: After the last iteration, `t` will be reduced by 1, making it equal to `t-1`. Since `t` was greater than 1, `t-1` will still be greater than 0, meaning there is at least one element left in the `results` list.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `t` is now `t-1` and `results` still has exactly `t-1` elements.

**State: **`t` is greater than 1, `results` is a list with exactly `t-1` elements**
