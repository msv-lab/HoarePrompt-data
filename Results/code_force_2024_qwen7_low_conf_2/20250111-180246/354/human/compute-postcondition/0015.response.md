Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `c1` is an input integer, `c2` is an input integer, `c3` is an input integer, `c4` is an input integer, `MOD` is 998244353, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each iteration from 0 to `t-1`, and `result` is the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the last iteration (when `t` is reached).**

Explanation:
- The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is a non-negative integer.
- During each iteration, `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, and `c4` are read from input and passed to `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)`.
- The result of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` is stored in the variable `result` and then appended to the list `results`.
- After all iterations, `results` will contain the return values of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for each of the `t` iterations.
- The variable `result` will hold the return value of `func_1(c1, c2, c3, c4)` for the last iteration when `t` is reached.
