`t` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, which means `t` now holds the integer input from the user. The values of `c1`, `c2`, `c3`, `c4`, and `MOD` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer equal to the input integer from the user, `c1` is an integer, `c2` is an integer, `c3` is an integer, `c4` is an integer, `MOD` is 998244353**
