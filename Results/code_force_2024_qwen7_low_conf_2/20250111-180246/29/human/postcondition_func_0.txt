The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. After executing the loop, `a` contains the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. The function returns `a`, ensuring that `b` is always 0 upon completion. This approach handles all possible cases where `a` and `b` are positive integers within their specified ranges. There are no missing functionalities in the given code, and it correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm without any edge cases being overlooked.
