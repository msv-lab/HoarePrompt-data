#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and the function calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. After executing the loop, `a` contains the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. The function returns `a`, ensuring that `b` is always 0 upon completion. This approach handles all possible cases where `a` and `b` are positive integers within their specified ranges. There are no missing functionalities in the given code, and it correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm without any edge cases being overlooked.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count` is the total number of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` was satisfied during the loop's execution, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of times the condition (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0 was satisfied during the loop's execution
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` as parameters, and returns the count of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is satisfied during the nested loop's execution, where `a` ranges from `1` to `n` and `b` ranges from `1` to `m`. The function iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the specified ranges and increments the `count` variable each time the condition is met. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a value such that the condition is never satisfied, the count will remain unchanged. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `m`; instead, it uses them to define the range of the loops. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `count` contains the total number of times the specified condition was satisfied, and both `n` and `m` retain their original values.
