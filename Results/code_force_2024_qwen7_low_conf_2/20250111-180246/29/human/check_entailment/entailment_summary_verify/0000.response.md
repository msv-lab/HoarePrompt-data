Reasoning:
Let's analyze the program based on the provided function summaries and the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This part of the program is correct.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`.
   - For each pair `(a, b)`, it checks if `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0`. This is the key condition we need to verify.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the `count` variable.
   - Finally, it returns the `count`.

Given the function summary, the program logic appears to be sound and aligns with the problem requirements. However, let's validate the overall correctness:

- The problem asks for the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 ≤ a ≤ n`, `1 ≤ b ≤ m`, and `(a + b) % (b * gcd(a, b)) == 0`.
- The function `func_2` correctly implements this logic by iterating through all possible pairs and checking the condition using `func_1` to compute the GCD.
- No edge cases or specific inputs were mentioned that would cause the program to fail, and the logic seems to cover all necessary cases.

Based on the function summaries and the problem description, the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs `(a, b)`.

Final: **True**
