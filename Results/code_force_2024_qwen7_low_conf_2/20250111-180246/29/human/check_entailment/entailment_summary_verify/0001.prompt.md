You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` as parameters, and returns the count of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is satisfied during the nested loop's execution, where `a` ranges from `1` to `n` and `b` ranges from `1` to `m`. The function iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the specified ranges and increments the `count` variable each time the condition is met. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a value such that the condition is never satisfied, the count will remain unchanged. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `m`; instead, it uses them to define the range of the loops. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `count` contains the total number of times the specified condition was satisfied, and both `n` and `m` retain their original values.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The implementation is correct and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`.
   - For each pair, it checks if the condition `(a + b) % (b * GCD(a, b)) == 0` holds true.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program does not include input/output handling, but based on the problem statement, we assume it correctly reads `t`, `n`, and `m` for each test case and prints the count for each test case.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The nested loops run up to `O(n * m)`. Given the constraints (`1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6`), this approach would be inefficient for large values. However, the correctness of the logic is what we need to verify here.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - We need to verify that for each pair `(a, b)` within the specified ranges, the function correctly counts pairs that satisfy the given condition.
   - The logic inside the function `func_2` appears to be correct based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the above points, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
