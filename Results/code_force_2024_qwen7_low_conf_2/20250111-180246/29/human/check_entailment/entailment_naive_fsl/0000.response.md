Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. The inner loop iterates through all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges, and the outer conditions check if the sum of `a` and `b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, and `func_2` uses this GCD to verify the condition for each pair (a, b). Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, no edge cases or specific inputs were found that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
