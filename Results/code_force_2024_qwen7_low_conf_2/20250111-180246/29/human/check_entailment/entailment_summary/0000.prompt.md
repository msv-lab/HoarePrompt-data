You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the programâ€™s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

Example

Input

    6
    
    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8
    
    100 1233
    
    1000000 1145141

Output

    1
    3
    4
    14
    153
    1643498
    
Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

# Functions with Execution Summary:
Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `a` and `b`. It uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`. After executing the loop, `a` contains the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is set to 0. The function returns `a`, ensuring that `b` is always 0 upon completion. This approach handles all possible cases where `a` and `b` are positive integers within their specified ranges. There are no missing functionalities in the given code, and it correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm without any edge cases being overlooked.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` as parameters, and returns the count of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is satisfied during the nested loop's execution, where `a` ranges from `1` to `n` and `b` ranges from `1` to `m`. The function iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the specified ranges and increments the `count` variable each time the condition is met. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a value such that the condition is never satisfied, the count will remain unchanged. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `m`; instead, it uses them to define the range of the loops. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `count` contains the total number of times the specified condition was satisfied, and both `n` and `m` retain their original values.
