Reasoning:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two integers `a` and `b`. This ensures that for any valid input within the specified ranges, `func_1` will return the correct GCD without any issues.
- `func_2` iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. For each pair, it checks if the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is satisfied. If the condition is true, it increments the count. This function correctly counts the number of valid pairs based on the provided conditions.
- The program does not have any missing functionalities, and the execution summaries indicate that both functions handle the specified ranges and edge cases appropriately.
- Given the constraints, the implementation appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all valid test cases.

Correctness: **True**
