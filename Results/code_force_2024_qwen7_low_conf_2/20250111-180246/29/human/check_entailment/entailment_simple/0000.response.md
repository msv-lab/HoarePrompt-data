Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The annotated program correctly implements the solution as described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**:
   - This function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The state of the program after the loop is such that `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.
   - This function correctly returns the GCD of `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2(n, m)`**:
   - This function iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`.
   - For each pair, it checks if the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is satisfied.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the `count`.
   - After iterating through all pairs, it returns the `count`, which is the total number of valid pairs.

### Why the Program is Correct:

- **Comprehensive Iteration**: The program iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the specified ranges, ensuring no valid pair is missed.
- **Correct Condition Check**: The condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is correctly evaluated using the GCD calculated by `func_1(a, b)`.
- **Accurate Counting**: The program maintains a count of all pairs that satisfy the given condition.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- **Valid Inputs**: The program assumes valid inputs (`1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6`) and handles them correctly.
- **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles the boundary conditions (`a = 1` and `b = 1`) without issues.

Since the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all required conditions, the program is correct. Therefore, the answer is **True**.
