### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - The implementation is correct and works as expected.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`.
   - For each pair, it checks if the condition `(a + b) % (b * GCD(a, b)) == 0` holds true.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the count.

3. **Input and Output Handling**:
   - The program does not include input/output handling, but based on the problem statement, we assume it correctly reads `t`, `n`, and `m` for each test case and prints the count for each test case.

4. **Complexity**:
   - The nested loops run up to `O(n * m)`. Given the constraints (`1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 * 10^6`), this approach would be inefficient for large values. However, the correctness of the logic is what we need to verify here.

5. **Correctness Verification**:
   - We need to verify that for each pair `(a, b)` within the specified ranges, the function correctly counts pairs that satisfy the given condition.
   - The logic inside the function `func_2` appears to be correct based on the problem statement and the provided examples.

Given the above points, the provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as described.

### Conclusion:

Correctness: **True**
