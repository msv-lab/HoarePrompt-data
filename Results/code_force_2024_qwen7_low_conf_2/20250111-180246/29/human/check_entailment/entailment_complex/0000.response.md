Reasoning:
- Function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive integers `a` and `b`. The implementation ensures that `a` holds the gcd value and `b` is set to 0 after the loop, which is the expected behavior.
- Function `func_2` correctly iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. For each pair, it checks if the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is satisfied. If the condition is met, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, the function returns the total count of such pairs.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles the problem statement's constraints and logic. The nested loops ensure that all possible pairs `(a, b)` are considered, and the gcd calculation is done efficiently using `func_1`.
- The function does not have any logical errors or missing parts that would prevent it from solving the problem as described.

Based on the above reasoning, the given program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
