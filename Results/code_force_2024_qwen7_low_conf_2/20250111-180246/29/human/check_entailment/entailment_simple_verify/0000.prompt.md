You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The two versions are different problems. You may want to read both versions.
You can make hacks only if both versions are solved.

You are given two positive integers n , m .

Calculate the number of ordered pairs (a, b) satisfying the following
conditions:

  * 1\le a\le n , 1\le b\le m ; 
  * a+b is a multiple of b \cdot \gcd(a,b) . 

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1\le t\le 10^4 ). The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , m (1\le n,m\le 2
\cdot 10^6 ).

It is guaranteed that neither the sum of n nor the sum of m over all test
cases exceeds 2 \cdot 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print a single integer: the number of valid pairs.

    1 1
    
    2 3
    
    3 5
    
    10 8

Note

In the first test case, only (1,1) satisfies the conditions.

In the fourth test case,
(1,1),(2,1),(2,2),(3,1),(4,1),(5,1),(6,1),(6,2),(6,3),(7,1),(8,1),(9,1),(10,1),(10,2)
satisfy the conditions.

- Program: 

#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
    return count



- Annotated Code: 
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n\), \(1 \leq b \leq m\), and the function calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b != 0:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the gcd of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns `a`, which is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6.
def func_2(n, m):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n + 1):
        for b in range(1, m + 1):
            if (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count` is the total number of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` was satisfied during the loop's execution, `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\), `m` is a non-negative integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\).
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of times the condition (a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0 was satisfied during the loop's execution




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ordered pairs (a, b) that satisfy the given conditions. The inner loop iterates through all possible values of `a` and `b` within their respective ranges, and the outer conditions check if the sum of `a` and `b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, and `func_2` uses this GCD to verify the condition for each pair (a, b). Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, no edge cases or specific inputs were found that would cause the program to fail. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
