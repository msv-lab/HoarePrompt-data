### Reasoning

Let's break down the program and the original assessment step-by-step:

1. **Function `func_1` - Euclidean Algorithm for GCD:**
   - This function correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`.
   - It iteratively replaces `a` with `b` and `b` with `a % b` until `b` becomes zero. At this point, `a` holds the GCD of the original `a` and `b`.

2. **Function `func_2`:**
   - This function iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 <= a <= n` and `1 <= b <= m`.
   - For each pair, it checks if the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` holds true.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it increments the counter `count`.

3. **Problem Description and Constraints:**
   - The problem requires counting pairs `(a, b)` such that `1 <= a <= n`, `1 <= b <= m`, and `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
   - The constraints are \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\) and the sum of `n` and `m` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\).

4. **Original Assessment:**
   - The assessment states that the program is correct because it correctly calculates the GCD and checks the condition for each pair.
   - No edge cases or specific inputs were found that would cause the program to fail.

5. **Annotated Code Analysis:**
   - The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the function calls.
   - The GCD calculation is accurate and used correctly in the condition check.
   - The nested loops cover all possible pairs within the given constraints.

Given the analysis, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of valid pairs, and there are no apparent issues or edge cases that would invalidate its correctness.

### Final Evaluation

Final: **True**

The program is correct based on the problem description and the given constraints.
