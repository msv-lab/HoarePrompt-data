### Reasoning

Let's analyze the program step-by-step based on the provided annotated code and the problem description.

#### Function `func_1` (Euclidean Algorithm)
The function `func_1` correctly implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b`. The algorithm ensures that after the loop, `a` holds the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is zero. This part of the program is accurate and correctly implemented.

#### Function `func_2`
The function `func_2` iterates over all possible pairs `(a, b)` where `1 ≤ a ≤ n` and `1 ≤ b ≤ m`. For each pair, it checks whether the sum `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)` using the GCD computed by `func_1`.

To ensure correctness, let's verify the logic:
1. **Loop Structure**: The nested loops correctly iterate over all possible pairs `(a, b)`.
2. **Condition Check**: The condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is checked for each pair. This condition ensures that `a + b` is a multiple of `b * gcd(a, b)`.
3. **Count Increment**: If the condition is met, the counter `count` is incremented.

Now, let's consider some specific examples and edge cases:
- **Example 1**: For `n = 1` and `m = 1`, there is only one pair `(1, 1)`. Since `1 + 1 = 2` and `1 * gcd(1, 1) = 1`, `2 % 1 == 0` is true. Thus, the output is `1`.
- **Example 4**: For `n = 10` and `m = 8`, we need to check all pairs `(a, b)` and increment the counter when the condition is satisfied. The valid pairs are listed in the example, and the count is `14`.

Based on the problem constraints and the examples provided, the program correctly counts the number of valid pairs.

### Conclusion
The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of ordered pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions. There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the provided examples and the constraints.

### Final Evaluation
