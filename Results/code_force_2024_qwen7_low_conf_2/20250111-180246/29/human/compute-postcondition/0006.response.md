Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` must be at least 1
   - `b` is any integer
   - `count` is 1 if `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))` equals 0, otherwise `count` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `b` in the range from 1 to `m + 1`.

3. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` must be at least 1
   - `b` is some value within the range [1, m]
   - `count` is 1 (since the condition was met for the previous value of `b`)

4. **For the Loop to Execute One More Time:**
   - The loop will execute one more time if `b` is less than `m`.
   - Since `b` must be an integer and the loop ranges from 1 to `m + 1`, `b` needs to be incremented by 1 to proceed to the next iteration.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `a` remains 1
   - `n` must still be greater than 0
   - `m` remains at least 1
   - `b` will be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes `b + 1`
   - `count` remains 1 since there is no else part in the code, and the condition was already met.

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`a` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `b` is `b + 1`, `count` is 1**
