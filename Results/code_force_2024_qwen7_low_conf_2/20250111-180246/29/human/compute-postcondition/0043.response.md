The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but operates over variables `t`, `n`, and `m` which are constrained as follows: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case, `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\). It is also guaranteed that the sum of `n` and the sum of `m` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^6\).

The function may return different outputs based on the values of `n` and `m` across the test cases. However, since no specific return conditions are provided in the problem statement, we can infer that the function processes these inputs according to some logic and then returns a result. 

Given the constraints, the function likely processes each test case and aggregates results based on `n` and `m`.

Functionality: **The function accepts implicit parameters `t`, `n`, and `m` with specified constraints and returns a result based on processing these inputs.**
