Let's think through this step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop is defined as `for b in range(1, m + 1):`, which means `b` will take values from 1 to `m` (inclusive).

2. **Determine Necessary States for the Loop to Execute**:
   - For the loop to execute, `m` must be at least 1. This ensures that there is at least one value for `b` in the range (1, m + 1).
   - The initial value of `b` will be 1.

3. **Current States Given**:
   - `a` is 1.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.

4. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - Since the loop depends on `m`, `m` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - `b` will start at 1, but since `b` is not directly mentioned in the given states, we do not need to explicitly state its initial value unless it affects the condition or behavior within the loop body.

5. **Combine the Necessary States**:
   - We need to ensure `m` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - We already know `a` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 0, but these do not affect the loop's execution directly based on the provided information.

Thus, the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute are:

State: **`a` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1**
