The code `print(out)` prints the value of `out`. Since `out` is the next element in the `outs` list, it is printed but its value is not stored back into any variable. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`outs` is a list with at least two more elements, `out` is the next element in the `outs` list, and the value of `out` has been printed.**
