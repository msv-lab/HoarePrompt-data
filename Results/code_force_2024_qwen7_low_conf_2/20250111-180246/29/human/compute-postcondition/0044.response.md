Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by two positive integers \( n \) and \( m \). For each test case, it calculates the sum of \(\left\lfloor \frac{n + b}{b^2} \right\rfloor\) for \( b \) ranging from 1 to \( m \), subtracts 1 from the total, and stores this value in a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each stored value. The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads inputs for \( t \) (number of test cases), \( n \) (integer for each test case), and \( m \) (integer for each test case) from standard input. There are no explicit return values, but the final state includes a list of processed values for each test case. Potential edge cases include handling the minimum values for \( n \) and \( m \) (both set to 1), and ensuring that the total number of \( n \) and \( m \) values does not exceed \( 2 \cdot 10^6 \).**
