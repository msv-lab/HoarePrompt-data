Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `a` is 3
- `b` is `b + 1` (or `m + 1` if `b` is equal to `m`)
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `count` is incremented by 1 if `(a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is true; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.

### Loop Statement:
```python
for b in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `b` from 1 to `m` inclusive.
   - After each iteration, `b` is updated as `b + 1`.
   - If `b` reaches `m`, it updates to `m + 1`.

2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - We know `b` is either `b + 1` or `m + 1` depending on its value relative to `m`.
   - `m` is a non-negative integer.
   - `count` is incremented based on a condition involving `a`, `b`, and `func_1(a, b)`.

3. **Determining the Next State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to satisfy the range condition `1 <= b < m + 1`.
   - Since `b` is already at `b + 1` or `m + 1`, we need to ensure that `b` moves to the next valid position within the range.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - If `b` is currently `b + 1`, then for the next iteration, `b` should be `b + 2` (since `b` is incremented by 1 in each iteration).
   - If `b` is currently `m + 1`, then for the next iteration, `b` should be reset to 1 (starting of the range).

5. **Updating Other Variables**:
   - `count` remains unchanged unless the condition `(a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is met, but this does not affect the state of `b` directly.

### Final Adjusted State:

Given that `b` must be in the range `1` to `m` for the loop to continue, and considering the current state where `b` is either `b + 1` or `m + 1`, the state needs to adjust to ensure `b` is within the valid range for the next iteration.

State: **`a` is 3, `b` is 1, `m` is a non-negative integer, `count` is incremented by 1 if `(a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is true; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.**

This ensures that `b` starts at the beginning of the range `1` for the next iteration of the loop.
