Postcondition: ***`a` is 2, `b` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `m` must be at least 3. If `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0`, then the function sets some unspecified variables to certain values (as described in the if part, but the specific values are not provided). Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains unchanged from the if part if the condition is true.*** 

Note: The specific variables and their values set in the if part are not detailed in the provided information, so the postcondition reflects that the condition being met or not would leave the variables in a state consistent with the if part's action.
