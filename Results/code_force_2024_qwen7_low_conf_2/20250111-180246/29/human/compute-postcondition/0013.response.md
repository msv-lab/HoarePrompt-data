According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `a` and `n`. The loop condition is `a` is within the range `[1, n + 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be incremented by 1 and still remain within the range `[1, n + 1)`.

Given that `a` starts at 1 and `n` is greater than 0, if `a` was 1, then for the loop to continue, `a` must be 2 and `n` must still be greater than 0.

So, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

- `a` must be 2.
- `n` must still be greater than 0.

State: **`a` is 2, `n` is greater than 0**
