Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is 2
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `b` is 1
   - `m` must be at least 1
   - The condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))` is checked.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for b in range(1, m + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over values of `b` starting from 1 up to `m` inclusive.
   - The initial value of `b` is 1, and it needs to be incremented by 1 for each iteration.
   - The loop will continue as long as `b` is within the range `[1, m]`.

4. **Determine the New Value of `b`:**
   - Since the loop starts with `b = 1`, for the next iteration, `b` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `b` will become 2 for the next iteration.

5. **Condition Check for the Next Iteration:**
   - The condition to check in the next iteration is `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))`.
   - Substituting the new value of `b`, the condition becomes `(a + 2) % (2 * func_1(2, 2))`.

6. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The value of `a` remains unchanged, so `a` is still 2.
   - The value of `b` increases by 1, so `b` is now 2.
   - The value of `n` remains unchanged since it is not involved in the loop and no information about `n` is provided in the loop body.
   - The value of `m` remains unchanged since it is not modified in the loop and no information about `m` is provided in the loop body.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`a` is 2, `b` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1**.
