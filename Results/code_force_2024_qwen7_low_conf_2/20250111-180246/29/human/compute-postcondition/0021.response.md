According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b` and `m`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `m + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, and `count` is determined based on the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `a` is 2
- `b` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` must be at least 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `b` must be incremented by 1, so `b` becomes 3. Also, `m` must still satisfy the condition of being at least 1.

Given that `b` starts from 1 and goes up to `m`, if `b` is currently 2, then for the loop to continue, `b` needs to be 3. This means `m` must be at least 3 (since `b` increments by 1 each iteration and we want it to reach 3).

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `b` must be 3
- `m` must be at least 3

The updated state is:
State: **`a` is 2, `b` is 3, `n` is greater than 0, `m` must be at least 3**
