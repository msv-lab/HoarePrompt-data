`count` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `count` is not specified. However, since `count` was not defined before this line, it is assumed to be 0 initially. The other variables (`a`, `n`, `m`, `b`) remain unchanged according to the precondition.

Output State: **`a` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` must be at least 1, `b` is any integer, the expression `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))` equals 0, `count` is 1**
