The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `m`. Both `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^6. The function executes a loop and counts the number of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is satisfied, where `a` and `b` are integers ranging from `n` to `m` inclusive. After the loop completes, the function returns the count of times the condition was satisfied.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two parameters `n` and `m`, and return the count of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is satisfied during the loop's execution, where `a` and `b` range from `n` to `m` inclusive.
