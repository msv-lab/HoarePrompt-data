Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` as parameters, and returns the count of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` is satisfied during the nested loop's execution, where `a` ranges from `1` to `n` and `b` ranges from `1` to `m`. The function iterates through all possible pairs `(a, b)` within the specified ranges and increments the `count` variable each time the condition is met. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a value such that the condition is never satisfied, the count will remain unchanged. The function does not modify the input parameters `n` and `m`; instead, it uses them to define the range of the loops. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that the variable `count` contains the total number of times the specified condition was satisfied, and both `n` and `m` retain their original values.**

Note: The annotation mentions that `n` and `m` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^6\). However, the code itself does not enforce these constraints. Therefore, it is important to consider that the function could potentially encounter large values of `n` and `m`, which might lead to performance issues due to the nested loop structure. Additionally, the function relies on `func_1(a, b)` being defined and returning a valid integer for all `a` and `b` within the specified ranges. If `func_1(a, b)` ever returns zero, it would result in a division by zero error, which should be handled appropriately to ensure the function's robustness.
