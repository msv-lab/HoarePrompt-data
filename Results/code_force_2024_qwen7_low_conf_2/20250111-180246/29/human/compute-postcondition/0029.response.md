Postcondition: ***`a` is 3, `b` is a value within the range [1, m], `m` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the number of times the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) was satisfied during the loop's execution (unchanged). If the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) is true, then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
