Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is 2
   - `b` is `m + 1`
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - `m` is a non-negative integer
   - `count` is the number of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` was satisfied during the loop's execution

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for a in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop iterates over `a` starting from 1 up to `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `a` is 2, meaning the loop has already incremented `a` once.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `a` must be incremented to 3.
   - Therefore, the new value of `a` will be 3.
   - The value of `b` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop, so `b` is still `m + 1`.
   - The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the loop.
   - The value of `count` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.

4. **Final State:**
   - `a` is now 3
   - `b` is still `m + 1`
   - `n` is a non-negative integer
   - `m` is a non-negative integer
   - `count` is the number of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` was satisfied during the loop's execution (unchanged)

Therefore, the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time are:

State: **`a` is 3, `b` is `m + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the number of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` was satisfied during the loop's execution**.
