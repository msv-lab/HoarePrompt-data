`count` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `count` is not specified. However, we know that the operation `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))` holds true, and the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 2, `n` is greater than 0, `b` is 1, `m` must be at least 1, `count` is 1, and `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b))` is equal to 0**
