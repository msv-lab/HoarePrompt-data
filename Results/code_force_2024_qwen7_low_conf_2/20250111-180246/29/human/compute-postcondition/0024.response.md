Output State: **`a` is 2, `b` is `m + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the number of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` was satisfied during the loop's execution.**

### Explanation:
- **`a` is 2**: The value of `a` remains constant throughout the loop since it is not modified inside the loop.
- **`b` is `m + 1`**: The loop runs until `b` reaches `m + 1`. This means that `b` will take all values from 1 to `m` inclusive. After the loop finishes, `b` will be `m + 1`.
- **`n` is a non-negative integer**: The value of `n` is not modified within the loop, and it is mentioned that `n` is greater than 0 initially. Thus, `n` remains a non-negative integer.
- **`m` is a non-negative integer**: The value of `m` is not modified within the loop, but it needs to be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once.
- **`count` is the number of times the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` was satisfied during the loop's execution**: Each time the condition `(a + b) % (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0` evaluates to `True`, `count` increments by 1. If the condition never evaluates to `True`, `count` remains 0.

This output state captures the final values and conditions of all relevant variables after the loop has completed its execution.
