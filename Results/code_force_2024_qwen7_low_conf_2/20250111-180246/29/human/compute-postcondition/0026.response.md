Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `a` is now 3
- `b` is still `m + 1`
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `m` is a non-negative integer
- `count` is the number of times the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) was satisfied during the loop's execution (unchanged)

### For Loop Statement:
```
for b in range(1, m + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `b` is within the range from 1 to `m + 1` (exclusive). Specifically, the loop will run when `b` is in the range `[1, m]`.

2. **Current State of `b`**: Initially, `b` is set to `m + 1`. Since the loop iterates over `range(1, m + 1)`, `b` starting at `m + 1` means it is out of the valid range for the loop to execute.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - To make the loop execute, `b` must be within the range `[1, m]`. Therefore, `b` must be adjusted to a value within this range.

4. **Other Variables**:
   - `a` remains 3.
   - `m` remains a non-negative integer.
   - `n` remains a non-negative integer.
   - `count` remains unchanged.

### Conclusion:
To allow the loop to execute, we need to adjust `b` to be within the range `[1, m]`.

### Final State:
State: **`a` is 3, `b` is a value within the range [1, m], `m` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is the number of times the condition \((a + b) \% (b * func_1(a, b)) == 0\) was satisfied during the loop's execution (unchanged)**

This ensures that the loop can start executing with the correct initial value of `b`.
