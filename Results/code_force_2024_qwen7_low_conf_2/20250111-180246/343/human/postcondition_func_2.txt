The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, and `n`, an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd. The function returns a list `a` of `n` zeros. After executing the function, the list `a` is filled such that for each position `i` (where \(0 \leq i < \frac{n}{2}\)), the value at `a[i]` and `a[n - 1 - i]` is either 0 or calculated based on the corresponding values in `odds`. Specifically, when `idx == n - 1 - idx`, the value at `a[idx]` is directly set to the current value in `odds`. Otherwise, the values at `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to half the difference between the current value in `odds` and the previous value `prev`. The function ensures that `a` is symmetric around its center.
