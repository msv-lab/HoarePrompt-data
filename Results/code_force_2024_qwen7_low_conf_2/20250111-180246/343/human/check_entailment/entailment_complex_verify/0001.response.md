### Reasoning:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**: The original assessment correctly points out that `func_1(a)` is not used correctly. It should take the list of subarray sums as input instead of trying to calculate subarray sums from an unknown array `a`. This function is crucial for generating the list of subarray sums that will be processed further.

2. **Function `func_2(cts)`**: This function correctly identifies the unique subarray sums by removing duplicates. The logic is sound, and the function works as expected.

3. **Function `func_3(odds, n)`**: The function `func_3` is designed to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` from the unique subarray sums. However, the original assessment incorrectly states that the logic is flawed and overly simplistic. Let's analyze the logic more closely:
   - The function initializes a list `a` of zeros.
   - It iterates through the unique subarray sums and sets the values in the palindrome array based on the sums.
   - When `idx == n - 1 - idx`, it directly sets the value at the middle of the array.
   - Otherwise, it sets the symmetric values around the center.
   
   This approach is indeed correct for constructing a palindrome array from the subarray sums. The logic is sound and covers all necessary cases for constructing a valid palindrome.

4. **Function `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**: This function is not used in the provided solution, which aligns with the original assessment. It appears to be a leftover or misinterpretation of the problem requirements.

Given the detailed analysis:
- `func_1` should be corrected to accept the list of subarray sums.
- `func_2` and `func_3` are correctly implemented and logically sound.
- `func_4` is not used in the provided solution.

However, the overall logic of the program, once corrected, should be able to recover a valid palindrome array from the given subarray sums. The primary issue lies in the initial setup of `func_1` rather than the core logic of `func_2` and `func_3`.

### Final Evaluation:

Since the core logic of the program, once `func_1` is corrected, is sound and should work as intended, the original assessment is **inaccurate**.

**Final: False**
