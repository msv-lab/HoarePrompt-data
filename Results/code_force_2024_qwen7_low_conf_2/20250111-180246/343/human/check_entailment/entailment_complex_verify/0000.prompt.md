You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of n positive integers. You know that a is a
palindrome, or in other words, for all 1 \le i \le n , a_i = a_{n + 1 - i} .
You are given the sums of all but one of its distinct subarrays, in arbitrary
order. The subarray whose sum is not given can be any of the \frac{n(n+1)}{2}
distinct subarrays of a .

Recover any possible palindrome a . The input is chosen such that there is
always at least one array a that satisfies the conditions.

An array b is a subarray of a if b can be obtained from a by the deletion of
several (possibly, zero or all) elements from the beginning and several
(possibly, zero or all) elements from the end.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 200 ) —
the number of test cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (3 \le n \le 1000
) — the size of the array a .

The next line of each test case contains \frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1 integers s_i
(1\leq s_i \leq 10^9 ) — all but one of the subarray sums of a .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 1000 .

Additional constraint on the input: There is always at least one valid
solution.

Hacks are disabled for this problem.

Output

For each test case, print one line containing n positive integers a_1, a_2,
\cdots a_n — any valid array a . Note that a must be a palindrome.

If there are multiple solutions, print any.

    3 5 5 3 
    6 4 4 6 
    1 1 1 1 1 
    2 1 2 1 2 
    500000000 500000000 500000000 
    
Note

For the first example case, the subarrays of a = [1, 2, 1] are:

  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [2] with sum 2 , 
  * [1] with sum 1 , 
  * [1, 2] with sum 3 , 
  * [2, 1] with sum 3 , 
  * [1, 2, 1] with sum 4 . 

So the full list of subarray sums is 1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4 , and the sum that is
missing from the input list is 3 .

For the second example case, the missing subarray sum is 4 , for the subarray
[2, 2] .

For the third example case, the missing subarray sum is 13 , because there are
two subarrays with sum 13 ([3, 5, 5] and [5, 5, 3] ) but 13 only occurs once
in the input.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array, and the length of a is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\) where \(n\) is the size of the original palindrome array.

        for j in range(i, len(a)):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` from the start to the last index, `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from the beginning of `a` up to every index, `i` is 0.
    cts.sort()
    return cts
    #The program returns the sorted list of all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from the beginning of list `a` up to every index, which is represented by variable `cts`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. The length of `a` is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\), where \(n\) is the size of the original palindrome array. The function calculates all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from the beginning of list `a` up to every index. It then sorts these cumulative sums in ascending order. The function returns the sorted list of these cumulative sums.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: cts is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array a. Each element in cts is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^9\), inclusive.
def func_2(cts):
    odds = []
    for ct in cts:
        if len(odds) > 0 and ct == odds[-1]:
            odds.pop()
        else:
            odds.append(ct)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `cts` is an empty list, and `odds` is a list containing the unique subarray sums of the palindrome array `a`.
    return odds
    #The program returns the list 'odds' containing the unique subarray sums of the palindrome array 'a'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` which contains all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`. It processes `cts` by maintaining a list `odds` that only includes unique subarray sums. Specifically, for each element `ct` in `cts`, if `ct` is already the last element in `odds`, it is removed; otherwise, `ct` is added to `odds`. After processing all elements in `cts`, the function returns the list `odds` containing the unique subarray sums of the palindrome array `a`. 

Potential edge cases include scenarios where `cts` is empty or contains duplicate elements. In such cases, the function correctly handles them by ensuring that `odds` only contains unique values. Additionally, if `cts` is empty, the function will return an empty list. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; however, the function assumes that `cts` does not contain the sum of the entire array `a`, which would need to be handled separately if required.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: odds is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array a of size n, and n is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 1000 and n is odd.
def func_3(odds, n):
    a = [0] * n
    prev = 0
    idx = (n - 1) // 2
    for x in odds:
        if idx == n - 1 - idx:
            a[idx] = x
        else:
            a[idx] = (x - prev) // 2
            a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
        
        prev = x
        
        idx = idx - 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `idx` is `-1`, `x` is the last odd number in the sequence `odds`, `prev` is equal to `x`, and `a` is a list of `n` zeros where each element is either `0` or set according to the logic inside the loop.
    return a
    #The program returns a list 'a' of 'n' zeros
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, and `n`, an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd. The function returns a list `a` of `n` zeros. After executing the function, the list `a` is filled such that for each position `i` (where \(0 \leq i < \frac{n}{2}\)), the value at `a[i]` and `a[n - 1 - i]` is either 0 or calculated based on the corresponding values in `odds`. Specifically, when `idx == n - 1 - idx`, the value at `a[idx]` is directly set to the current value in `odds`. Otherwise, the values at `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to half the difference between the current value in `odds` and the previous value `prev`. The function ensures that `a` is symmetric around its center.

#Function 4:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: bigList is a list of integers representing the complete list of subarray sums, and smallList is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array a.
def func_4(bigList, smallList):
    while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
        bigList.pop()
        
        smallList.pop()
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `bigList` is an empty list, `smallList` is a list with all elements except the last one of the original `smallList` removed, and the original last element of `smallList` was not equal to the last element of `bigList` (or `bigList` was empty)
    return bigList[-1]
    #The program returns the last element of the original `bigList` if it exists, otherwise returns None
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, which are both lists of integers. The function aims to check if the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. If they are, the function removes the last elements from both lists until they are no longer equal or one of the lists becomes empty. After the loop, the function returns the last element of the original `bigList` if it exists; otherwise, it returns `None`.




Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  1 2 3 4 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  1 2 1
  ```

- **Program Execution:**
  - `func_1` generates the list of subarray sums from the input array `[1, 2, 1]`, which includes all subarray sums in sorted order.
  - `func_2` filters out duplicate sums, leaving us with the unique sums.
  - `func_3` attempts to reconstruct the original array from the unique sums. However, the logic in `func_3` does not correctly handle the reconstruction of the palindrome array.

Let's walk through the reconstruction process for the example input `[1, 2, 1]`:

1. **Original array:** `[1, 2, 1]`
2. **Subarray sums:** `[1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4]`
3. **Unique subarray sums:** `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
4. **Reconstruction attempt:**
   - `a = [0, 0, 0]`
   - `prev = 0`
   - `idx = 1`
   - For `x = 1`:
     - `a[1] = 1` (since `idx` is 1, and it's the middle element in a palindrome of length 3)
     - `prev = 1`
     - `idx = 0`
   - For `x = 2`:
     - `a[0] = (2 - 1) / 2 = 0.5` (this is not an integer, which is invalid for the problem constraints)
     - `a[2] = (2 - 1) / 2 = 0.5` (this is not an integer, which is invalid for the problem constraints)
     - `prev = 2`
     - `idx = -1`

As you can see, the program fails to correctly reconstruct the palindrome array due to invalid integer division results. This indicates that the logic in `func_3` is flawed and cannot produce the correct output for all cases.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem and hence the correctness is **False**.
