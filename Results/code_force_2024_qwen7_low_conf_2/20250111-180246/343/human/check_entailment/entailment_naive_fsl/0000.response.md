Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. Let's consider a specific example to illustrate this:

### Example:
- **Input:**
  ```
  3
  1 2 3 4 1
  ```

- **Expected Output:**
  ```
  1 2 1
  ```

- **Program Execution:**
  - `func_1` generates the list of subarray sums from the input array `[1, 2, 1]`, which includes all subarray sums in sorted order.
  - `func_2` filters out duplicate sums, leaving us with the unique sums.
  - `func_3` attempts to reconstruct the original array from the unique sums. However, the logic in `func_3` does not correctly handle the reconstruction of the palindrome array.

Let's walk through the reconstruction process for the example input `[1, 2, 1]`:

1. **Original array:** `[1, 2, 1]`
2. **Subarray sums:** `[1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4]`
3. **Unique subarray sums:** `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
4. **Reconstruction attempt:**
   - `a = [0, 0, 0]`
   - `prev = 0`
   - `idx = 1`
   - For `x = 1`:
     - `a[1] = 1` (since `idx` is 1, and it's the middle element in a palindrome of length 3)
     - `prev = 1`
     - `idx = 0`
   - For `x = 2`:
     - `a[0] = (2 - 1) / 2 = 0.5` (this is not an integer, which is invalid for the problem constraints)
     - `a[2] = (2 - 1) / 2 = 0.5` (this is not an integer, which is invalid for the problem constraints)
     - `prev = 2`
     - `idx = -1`

As you can see, the program fails to correctly reconstruct the palindrome array due to invalid integer division results. This indicates that the logic in `func_3` is flawed and cannot produce the correct output for all cases.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem and hence the correctness is **False**.
