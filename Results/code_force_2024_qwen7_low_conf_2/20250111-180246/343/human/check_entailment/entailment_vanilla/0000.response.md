Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the given program, we need to ensure that it correctly recovers a palindrome array `a` from the provided subarray sums, except for one. Let's break down the solution step by step:

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**: This function calculates all possible subarray sums of the array `a`. However, the function does not actually receive the hidden palindrome array `a` but rather is supposed to generate a list of subarray sums for an unknown palindrome array. Therefore, `func_1(a)` is not used correctly and should be replaced with a function that takes the list of subarray sums as input.

2. **Function `func_2(cts)`**: This function removes duplicate subarray sums from the list `cts`. It aims to identify the unique subarray sums. This is a crucial step since we need to find the missing sum to reconstruct the palindrome array.

3. **Function `func_3(odds, n)`**: This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` using the unique subarray sums. However, the logic here is flawed. The function assumes that the subarray sums can directly map to the values in the palindrome array, which is not necessarily true without additional context. Specifically, the logic for setting the middle value and the symmetric values around it is overly simplistic and might not cover all cases correctly.

4. **Function `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**: This function is not used in the provided solution and is likely a leftover or a misinterpretation of the problem requirements. It seems intended to remove matching elements from two lists, but it is not utilized in the main logic.

Given the above analysis, the provided functions do not correctly solve the problem as stated. They fail to properly handle the reconstruction of the palindrome array from the subarray sums.

Correctness: **False**
