### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the provided functions and their roles in solving the problem.

1. **Function `func_1(a)`**: This function calculates all possible subarray sums of an array `a`. Given the problem statement, this function should take a list of subarray sums as input and generate the full list of subarray sums for an unknown palindrome array. However, the function `func_1(a)` is currently calculating subarray sums for an array `a`, which is not aligned with the problem requirement. This function needs to be corrected to take the list of subarray sums and generate the full list of subarray sums for a potential palindrome array.

2. **Function `func_2(cts)`**: This function removes duplicate subarray sums from the list `cts`. It correctly identifies unique subarray sums, which is essential for finding the missing sum. However, it does not inherently help in reconstructing the palindrome array directly. We need to use this list of unique subarray sums to infer the structure of the palindrome array.

3. **Function `func_3(odds, n)`**: This function attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array `a` using the unique subarray sums. The logic here is indeed flawed, but let's break it down to understand why:
   - The function assumes the middle value and then propagates values symmetrically around it. However, this assumption is too simplistic and may not always hold. For example, consider a palindrome array like `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The subarray sums would include sums like `1+2+3+2+1=9`, `2+3+2=7`, etc. The function's logic might not capture these relationships correctly.
   - The function's logic for setting the middle value and symmetric values is overly simplistic and might not cover all cases correctly. It assumes that the middle value and the symmetric values can be derived directly from the subarray sums, which is not always true.

4. **Function `func_4(bigList, smallList)`**: This function is not used in the provided solution and is likely a leftover or a misinterpretation of the problem requirements. It seems intended to remove matching elements from two lists, but it is not utilized in the main logic.

### Correcting the Functions:

- **Function `func_1`**: Should be corrected to accept a list of subarray sums and generate the full list of subarray sums for a potential palindrome array.
- **Function `func_3`**: Needs a more sophisticated approach to reconstruct the palindrome array. One possible method could involve using dynamic programming or other combinatorial techniques to ensure the palindrome property is maintained.

### Revisiting the Original Assessment:

The original assessment correctly identified that the current implementation is flawed due to the incorrect usage of `func_1` and the oversimplified logic in `func_3`.

However, the core idea of the solution is sound: it correctly identifies the unique subarray sums and attempts to reconstruct the palindrome array. With appropriate corrections to the functions, the solution can be made correct.

### Conclusion:

While the current implementation is flawed, the fundamental approach is correct. With proper corrections and enhancements, the solution can be made to work correctly.

### Final Evaluation:

Final: **False**
