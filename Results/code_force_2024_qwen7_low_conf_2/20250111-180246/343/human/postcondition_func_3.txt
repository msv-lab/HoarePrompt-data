The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, which are both lists of integers. The function aims to check if the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. If they are, the function removes the last elements from both lists until they are no longer equal or one of the lists becomes empty. After the loop, the function returns the last element of the original `bigList` if it exists; otherwise, it returns `None`.
