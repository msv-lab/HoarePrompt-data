The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. The length of `a` is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\), where \(n\) is the size of the original palindrome array. The function calculates all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from the beginning of list `a` up to every index. It then sorts these cumulative sums in ascending order. The function returns the sorted list of these cumulative sums.
