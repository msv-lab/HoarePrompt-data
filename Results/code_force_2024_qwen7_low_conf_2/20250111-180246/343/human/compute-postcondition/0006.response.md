To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions in the `while` loop:

The loop condition is:
```
while len(smallList) > 0 and bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]:
```

This means the loop will continue as long as both conditions are true:
1. The length of `smallList` is greater than 0.
2. The last element of `bigList` is equal to the last element of `smallList`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `smallList` has its last element removed.

Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. **Condition 1: Length of `smallList` > 0**
   - After removing the last element from `smallList`, `smallList` now has fewer elements. For the loop to continue, `smallList` must still have at least one element.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `smallList` has at least one element before the loop continues.

2. **Condition 2: bigList[-1] == smallList[-1]**
   - The last element of `bigList` must be equal to the last element of `smallList` for the loop to continue.
   - Since `smallList` has had its last element removed, we need to check if the second-to-last element of `smallList` (now the last element) matches the last element of `bigList`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that the second-to-last element of `smallList` (after the removal) is equal to the last element of `bigList`.

Given these conditions, the necessary adjustments are:
- Ensure that `smallList` has at least one element.
- Ensure that the second-to-last element of `smallList` is equal to the last element of `bigList`.

Thus, the modified state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`smallList` must have at least one element and the second-to-last element of `smallList` must be equal to the last element of `bigList`**.
