Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. The length of `a` is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\), where \(n\) is the size of the original palindrome array. The function calculates all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from the beginning of list `a` up to every index. It then sorts these cumulative sums in ascending order. The function returns the sorted list of these cumulative sums.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input list `a` is correctly formatted as described (i.e., it contains subarray sums of a palindrome array and has the correct length). If `a` does not meet these conditions, the behavior is undefined.
- There are no explicit checks for invalid inputs such as non-integer elements or incorrect list lengths. While the function does not explicitly fail, incorrect inputs could lead to unexpected results or errors in downstream processing.
- The function does not handle empty lists or lists with a single element specially. However, given the specified length formula, such edge cases should not occur as per the problem statement.
- The function does not modify the input list `a` itself; it only works with a copy of the list during its operation.
- The function does not provide any information about the original palindrome array or its properties beyond the subarray sums.

In summary, the function calculates and returns a sorted list of all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from the beginning of the input list `a`, covering all valid inputs as per the provided constraints.
