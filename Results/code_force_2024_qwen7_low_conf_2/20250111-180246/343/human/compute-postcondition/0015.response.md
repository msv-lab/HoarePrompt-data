`a[n - 1 - idx]` is assigned the value of `(x - prev) // 2`. From the initial state, `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds`, `prev` is equal to `x`, and `a[idx]` is 0. The value of `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - x) // 2`, which simplifies to 0. The values of `idx`, `x`, `prev`, and `a[idx]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`idx` is `idx`, `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds`, `prev` is equal to `x`, `a[idx]` is 0, and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is 0.**
