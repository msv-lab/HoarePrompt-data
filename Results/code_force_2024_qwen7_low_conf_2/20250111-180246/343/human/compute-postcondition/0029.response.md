Functionality: **The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, and `n`, an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd. The function returns a list `a` of `n` zeros. After executing the function, the list `a` is filled such that for each position `i` (where \(0 \leq i < \frac{n}{2}\)), the value at `a[i]` and `a[n - 1 - i]` is either 0 or calculated based on the corresponding values in `odds`. Specifically, when `idx == n - 1 - idx`, the value at `a[idx]` is directly set to the current value in `odds`. Otherwise, the values at `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to half the difference between the current value in `odds` and the previous value `prev`. The function ensures that `a` is symmetric around its center.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- If `n` is even or less than 3, the function should raise an exception since these are outside the valid range for `n`.
- The function assumes that `odds` contains exactly \(n-1\) elements, which is necessary for the calculation. If `odds` has fewer or more elements, the function would behave unpredictably.
- The function correctly handles the symmetry of the palindrome array by ensuring that `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are set to the same value when `idx == n - 1 - idx`. However, it does not explicitly handle the case where `n` is the smallest possible value (i.e., `n = 3`). In this case, the loop would not execute, and `a` would remain `[0, 0, 0]`, which is the correct initial state.
