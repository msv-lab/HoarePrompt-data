The code `sm = sm + a[j]` updates the value of `sm` by adding the last element of `a` (which is indexed as `j`, where `j` is `len(a) - 1`) to the current value of `sm`. According to the initial state, `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` from the start to the second-to-last index plus the last element of `a`. Since `sm` already includes the last element of `a`, adding the last element again would double count it. However, based on the given code, the intention seems to be to include the last element once more.

Given that `sm` is initially defined as the sum of all elements in `a` from the start to the second-to-last index plus the last element, adding the last element again simply redefines `sm` to be the sum of all elements in `a` up to the last index.

Therefore, after the code execution, the value of `sm` is updated to the sum of all elements in `a`.

Output State: **`sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `cts` is a list of cumulative sums of all elements in `a` from the start to each index up to `len(a) - 2` with the final sum `sm` appended, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `cts` has `sm` appended**
