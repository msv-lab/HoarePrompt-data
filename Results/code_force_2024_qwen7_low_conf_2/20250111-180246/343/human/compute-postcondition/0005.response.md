The code `smallList.pop()` removes the last element from `smallList`. Since `bigList` having its last element removed was part of the initial state, it implies that `bigList` was modified before this code was run, and `smallList` is a separate list that undergoes the pop operation.

After running `smallList.pop()`, the last element of `smallList` is removed. The initial state only provides information about `bigList`, not `smallList`. Therefore, we only update the state of `smallList`.

Output State: **`smallList` has its last element removed**
