`a[idx]` is assigned the value of `x`. The value of `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds`, and `prev` is equal to `x`. Therefore, after executing the line of code, `x` will no longer be the next odd number in the sequence but will instead be stored in `a[idx]`, and `prev` will still hold the original value of `x`.

Output State: **`idx` is `idx`, `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds` (but now stored in `a[idx]`), `prev` is equal to the original value of `x`**
