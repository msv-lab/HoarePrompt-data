`bigList` has its last element removed using the `pop()` method. The last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` were initially equal, so after removing the last element from `bigList`, the last elements of both lists are no longer equal. However, all other elements in `smallList` remain the same.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers representing all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal.**
