The code assigns the current value of `x` to `prev`. This means that `prev` now holds the same value as `x`, and no other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the value of `x` remains unchanged, and the conditions for `a[idx]` and `prev` also remain as they were.

Output State: **`idx` is `idx`, `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds`, `prev` is equal to the original value of `x`, and both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are 0 if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, otherwise `prev` is equal to `x` and both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are 0.**
