The variable `idx` is decremented by 1. Based on the initial state, the following conditions are true:

- `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds`.
- `prev` is equal to the original value of `x`.
- Both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are 0 if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, otherwise `prev` is equal to `x` and both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are 0.

After decrementing `idx`, the new value of `idx` is `idx - 1`. The values of `x`, `prev`, and the elements in the list `a` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified by the code, which they are not here.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`idx` is `idx - 1`, `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds`, `prev` is equal to the original value of `x`, and both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are 0 if `idx` equals `n - 1 - idx`, otherwise `prev` is equal to `x` and both `a[idx]` and `a[n - 1 - idx]` are 0.**
