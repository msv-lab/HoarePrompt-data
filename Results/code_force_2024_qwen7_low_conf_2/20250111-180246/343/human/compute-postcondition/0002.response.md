The code removes the last element from `smallList`. The last element of `bigList` and `smallList` were previously not equal, but now since the last element of `smallList` is removed, this condition is no longer relevant. The states of `bigList` and `smallList` before the operation still hold true.

Output State: **`bigList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, `smallList` is a list of integers with the last element removed, and the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are no longer equal (since the last element of `smallList` has been removed).**
