The code `sm = sm + a[j]` updates the value of `sm` by adding the value of `a[j]` to it. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `sm` and `a[j]`. Therefore, we can only say that `sm` is updated to its current value plus the value of `a[j]`.

Output State: **`sm` is updated to its current value plus the value of `a[j]`, `a[j]` retains its original value**
