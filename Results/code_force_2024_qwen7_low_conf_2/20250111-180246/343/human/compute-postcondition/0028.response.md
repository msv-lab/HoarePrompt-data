The function `func_3` accepts two parameters: `odds`, which is a list of integers representing all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a palindrome array `a` of size `n`, and `n`, which is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 1000\) and `n` is odd. The function returns a list `a` of `n` zeros.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept a list `odds` and an integer `n`, and return a list `a` of `n` zeros.
