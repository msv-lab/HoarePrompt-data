The `pop()` method is called on `bigList`, which removes and returns the last element of `bigList`. However, since the initial state does not specify what `bigList` contains, we cannot determine the exact value of the removed element. We only know that the last element has been removed from `bigList`.

Output State: **`bigList` has its last element removed**
