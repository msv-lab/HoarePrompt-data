Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
   - `cts` is a list of cumulative sums of all elements in `a` from the start to each index up to `len(a) - 2` with the final sum `sm` appended twice.
   - `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` is `len(a) - 1`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` starting from `i` (which is `len(a) - 2`) up to `len(a)`.

3. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` is `len(a) - 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1.
   - Since `j` is currently `len(a) - 1`, incrementing `j` by 1 would make `j` equal to `len(a)`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `sm` remains unchanged as it is the sum of all elements in `a`.
   - `cts` remains unchanged as it is already a list of cumulative sums up to `len(a) - 2` with `sm` appended twice.
   - `i` remains `len(a) - 2` as it does not change within the loop.
   - `j` becomes `len(a)` for the next iteration.

**Final State:**
- `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`.
- `cts` is a list of cumulative sums of all elements in `a` from the start to each index up to `len(a) - 2` with the final sum `sm` appended twice.
- `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
- `j` is `len(a)`.

**State:**
**`sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `cts` is a list of cumulative sums of all elements in `a` from the start to each index up to `len(a) - 2` with the final sum `sm` appended twice, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(a)`**
