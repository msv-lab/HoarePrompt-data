The code `bigList.pop()` removes the last element from `bigList`. Since the second-to-last element of `smallList` must be equal to the last element of `bigList`, removing the last element from `bigList` means that the second-to-last element of `smallList` is no longer equal to the last element of `bigList`. However, the condition that `smallList` must have at least one element remains true.

Therefore, the output state is: `smallList` must have at least one element, the second-to-last element of `smallList` is no longer equal to the last element of `bigList` (which no longer exists).

Output State: **`smallList` must have at least one element, the second-to-last element of `smallList` is not equal to the last element of `bigList`**
