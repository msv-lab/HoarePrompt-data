Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` from the start to the second-to-last index plus the last element of `a`.
- `cts` is a list of cumulative sums of all elements in `a` from the start to each index up to `len(a) - 2` with the final sum `sm` appended.
- `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
- `j` is `len(a) - 2`.
- `cts` has `sm` appended.

### For Loop
The for loop is defined as:
```python
for j in range(i, len(a)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j` is within the range `[i, len(a))`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `len(a) - 2` and `j` is `len(a) - 2`.

2. **Incrementing `j`**: The loop increments `j` starting from `i` (which is `len(a) - 2`) until `j` reaches `len(a)`.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is `len(a) - 2`.
   - `j` is `len(a) - 2`.
   - `cts` has `sm` appended, meaning it contains the cumulative sums up to the second-to-last index plus the final sum `sm`.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to `len(a) - 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` should be `len(a) - 1`.

### Updated States
- Since `j` is incremented to `len(a) - 1`, the state needs to reflect this change.
- The other variables (`sm`, `cts`, `i`) remain unchanged.

### Final State
State: **`sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` from the start to the second-to-last index plus the last element of `a`, `cts` is a list of cumulative sums of all elements in `a` from the start to each index up to `len(a) - 2` with the final sum `sm` appended, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`, `cts` has `sm` appended**

This ensures that the loop can proceed to the next iteration with `j` being `len(a) - 1`.
