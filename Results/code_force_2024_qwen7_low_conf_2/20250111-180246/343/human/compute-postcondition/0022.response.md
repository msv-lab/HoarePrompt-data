Based on the initial state and the given Python code snippet:

- `idx` is `idx - 1`
- `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds`
- `prev` is equal to the original value of `x`
- `a[idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`
- `a[n - 1 - idx]` are 0

The code snippet is:
```python
a[n - 1 - idx] = (x - prev) // 2
```

This line of code updates `a[n - 1 - idx]` with the value of `(x - prev) // 2`. Given the initial state, we know:
- `a[n - 1 - idx]` was initially 0.
- `a[idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`.

After the code runs, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is updated to `(x - prev) // 2`, and since no other variables are affected, the updated values are as follows:
- `a[n - 1 - idx]` is now `(x - prev) // 2`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`idx` is `idx - 1`, `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds`, `prev` is equal to the original value of `x`, `a[idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`, `a[n - 1 - idx]` is `(x - prev) // 2`, and the rest of the variables retain their initial states.**
