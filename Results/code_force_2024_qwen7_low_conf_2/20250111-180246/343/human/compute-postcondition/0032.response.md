The code appends the value of `sm` to the list `cts`. Given the initial state, `cts` already contains the cumulative sums of all elements in `a` from the start to each index up to `len(a) - 2`, and the final sum `sm` is appended. The code simply appends `sm` again, so the updated `cts` will have `sm` repeated.

Therefore, the Output State is: `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `cts` is a list of cumulative sums of all elements in `a` from the start to each index up to `len(a) - 2` with the final sum `sm` appended twice, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`.

Output State: **`sm` is the sum of all elements in `a`, `cts` is a list of cumulative sums of all elements in `a` from the start to each index up to `len(a) - 2` with the final sum `sm` appended twice, `i` is `len(a) - 2`, `j` is `len(a) - 1`**
