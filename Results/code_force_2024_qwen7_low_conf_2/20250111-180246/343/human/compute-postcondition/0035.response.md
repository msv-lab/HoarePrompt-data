`cts` is appended with the value of `sm`. The value of `sm` is the current value of `sm` plus the value of `a[j]`. The value of `a[j]` retains its original value, and the value of `sm` is updated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `sm` is updated to its current value plus the value of `a[j]`; `a[j]` retains its original value; `cts` contains the previous value of `cts` plus the value of `sm`.

Output State: **`sm` is updated to its current value plus the value of `a[j]`; `a[j]` retains its original value; `cts` contains the previous value of `cts` plus the value of `sm`.**
