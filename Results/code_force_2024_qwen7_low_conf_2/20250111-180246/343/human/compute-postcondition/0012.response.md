Functionality: **The function `func_4` accepts two parameters, `bigList` and `smallList`, which are both lists of integers. The function aims to check if the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are equal. If they are, the function removes the last elements from both lists until they are no longer equal or one of the lists becomes empty. After the loop, the function returns the last element of the original `bigList` if it exists; otherwise, it returns `None`.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `bigList` or `smallList` is initially empty, the function will directly return `None`.
- If the last elements of `bigList` and `smallList` are never equal during the iteration, the function will remove elements from both lists until one of them is empty, then return the last element of the non-empty list (if any), or `None` if both become empty.
- If `bigList` contains fewer than two elements, the function will simply return the only remaining element, or `None` if `bigList` is empty after the loop.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not provide any feedback or action when the lists are modified during the process, such as logging or raising exceptions for invalid inputs (though the current code does not have invalid input handling beyond checking list lengths).
