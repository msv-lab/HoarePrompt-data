`prev` is assigned the value of `x`. The value of `x` does not change, and neither does `idx` or `a`. The other variables (`prev`, `a`, etc.) are not affected in terms of their relationships or conditions. Therefore, the only change is that `prev` now holds the value of `x`.

Output State: **`idx` is `idx - 1`, `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds`, `prev` is equal to the original value of `x`, and `prev` is now equal to `x`.**
