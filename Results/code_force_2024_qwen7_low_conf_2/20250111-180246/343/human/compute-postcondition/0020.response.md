The code `a[idx] = x` assigns the value of `x` to `a[idx]`. Based on the initial state, `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds`, and `prev` is equal to the original value of `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, after executing this line of code:

- `a[idx]` is now equal to `x`.
- `x` remains the next odd number in the sequence `odds`.
- `prev` remains equal to the original value of `x`.

The Output State is: **`idx` is `idx - 1`, `x` is the next odd number in the sequence `odds`, `prev` is equal to the original value of `x`, `a[idx]` is `x`, and `a[n - 1 - idx]` is 0.**
