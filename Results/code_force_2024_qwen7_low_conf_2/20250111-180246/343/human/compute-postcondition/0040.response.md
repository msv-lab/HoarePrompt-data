The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `a`, which is a list of integers representing the subarray sums of a palindrome array. The length of `a` is \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2} - 1\), where \(n\) is the size of the original palindrome array.

Case_1: The function returns a sorted list of all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from the beginning of list `a` up to every index, which is represented by variable `cts`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `a` of integers and return a sorted list of cumulative sums of subarrays starting from the beginning of `a` up to every index.
