The `pop()` method removes and returns the last element of `smallList`. Since `smallList` must have at least one element, the last element will be removed. The second-to-last element of `smallList` is not equal to the last element of `bigList`, which remains unchanged.

Output State: **`smallList` is now one element shorter; the second-to-last element of `smallList` is not equal to the last element of `bigList`**
