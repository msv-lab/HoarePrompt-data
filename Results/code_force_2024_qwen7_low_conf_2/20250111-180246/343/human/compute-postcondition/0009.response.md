Output State: **`bigList` is an empty list, `smallList` is a list with all elements except the last one of the original `smallList` removed, and the original last element of `smallList` was not equal to the last element of `bigList` (or `bigList` was empty)**

Explanation:
1. Initially, `bigList` contains all subarray sums and `smallList` contains all but one of these subarray sums.
2. The loop continues to execute as long as both lists are non-empty and their last elements are equal.
3. Each iteration removes the last elements from both `bigList` and `smallList`.
4. After multiple iterations, eventually, one of the lists will become empty, or the last elements of both lists will no longer match.
5. Since `bigList` starts with more elements and each iteration removes one element from both lists, `bigList` will become empty first if the lengths of the lists are different.
6. When `bigList` becomes empty, the loop stops, and `smallList` will have one fewer element than it originally did.
7. The final condition ensures that the last elements of the original lists were not equal, or `bigList` was empty due to the removal process.
