The `sort()` method sorts the list `cts` in ascending order. The initial value of `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` from the start to the last index, `cts` is a list containing all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from the beginning of `a` up to every index, and `i` is 0. After sorting `cts`, the output state will be: `sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` from the start to the last index, `cts` is a sorted list of all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from the beginning of `a` up to every index, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`sm` is the sum of all elements in `a` from the start to the last index, `cts` is a sorted list of all possible cumulative sums of subarrays starting from the beginning of `a` up to every index, `i` is 0**
