The function `func_2` accepts a list `cts` which contains all but one of the subarray sums of a palindrome array `a`. It processes `cts` by maintaining a list `odds` that only includes unique subarray sums. Specifically, for each element `ct` in `cts`, if `ct` is already the last element in `odds`, it is removed; otherwise, `ct` is added to `odds`. After processing all elements in `cts`, the function returns the list `odds` containing the unique subarray sums of the palindrome array `a`. 

Potential edge cases include scenarios where `cts` is empty or contains duplicate elements. In such cases, the function correctly handles them by ensuring that `odds` only contains unique values. Additionally, if `cts` is empty, the function will return an empty list. There is no missing functionality in the provided code; however, the function assumes that `cts` does not contain the sum of the entire array `a`, which would need to be handled separately if required.
