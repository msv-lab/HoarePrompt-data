a is a list of positive integers representing a palindrome, where the length of the list n satisfies 3 ≤ n ≤ 1000. The function getSubarraySums takes as input a list of integers which contains all but one of the distinct subarray sums of a, and returns a possible palindrome a that satisfies the conditions.
