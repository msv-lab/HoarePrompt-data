The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m` (the total number of months), `x` (the monthly salary), and `costs` (a list of costs associated with increasing happiness). The function first sorts the `costs` list in descending order. It then iterates through each month, accumulating earnings by adding the monthly salary. During each iteration, it checks if the highest remaining cost can be afforded with the current earnings. If so, it reduces the earnings by that cost and records a unit of happiness. This process continues until either all months have passed or no more costs can be afforded. Finally, the function returns the total number of units of happiness achieved.
