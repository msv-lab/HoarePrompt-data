The `costs.pop()` function removes the last element from the `costs` list. Since the last element in the `costs` list is removed, the length of the list decreases by 1. The states of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `earnings`, and `happiness`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 3*costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1, 1, 1]`, and the `costs` list has its last element removed.**
