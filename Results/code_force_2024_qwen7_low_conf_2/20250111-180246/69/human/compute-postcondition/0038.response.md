The `pop()` method removes and returns the last element of the `costs` list. Given the initial conditions, the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`. After executing `costs.pop()`, the last element of `costs` is removed, and its value is returned.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `earnings` is `initial_earnings + 2 * x - costs[-1]`, `happiness` is a list of length 4 filled with ones, and the last element of `costs` is removed and its value is returned.**
