The code `rs.append(cnt)` appends the current value of `cnt` to the list `rs`. The values of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `l` is a list containing two integers.
- `mx` is the maximum count of consecutive valid operations.
- `s` is the sum of `m` added to the initial value of `s` plus the adjustments made during each iteration.
- `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive valid operations.
- `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements from `l` that were successfully subtracted from `s` and then pushed into the heap.
- `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents.
- `i` is `n`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `s` is updated to `s + m` after each iteration.

After executing `rs.append(cnt)`, the value of `rs` changes, but the values of all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is the maximum count of consecutive valid operations; `s` is the sum of `m` added to the initial value of `s` plus the adjustments made during each iteration; `cnt` is the maximum count of consecutive valid operations; `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements from `l` that were successfully subtracted from `s` and then pushed into the heap; `rs` is a list containing the previous elements and the current value of `cnt` appended to it; `i` is `n`; `n` is a non-negative integer; `s` is updated to `s + m` after each iteration.**
