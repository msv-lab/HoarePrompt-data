Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing two integers (the split values of the input), `mx` is 0, `s` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `h` is an empty list, `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents, `i` is initialized to 0 and `n` is greater than 0, `s` is less than `l[i]`. The if condition is `(h)`, which evaluates to true since `h` is an empty list (and thus truthy in a boolean context).***
