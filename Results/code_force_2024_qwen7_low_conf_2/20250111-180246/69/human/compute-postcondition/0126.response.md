The code `mx = max(mx, cnt)` updates the value of `mx` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `cnt`. Given that `cnt` is 2, and the initial value of `mx` is 1, `mx` will be updated to 2.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is 2; `s` is `s + m - l[1]`; `cnt` is 2; `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]` twice (after adjustment to maintain heap property); `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is 1.**
