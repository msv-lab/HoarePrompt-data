The code appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. Initially, `happiness` is a list of length 5 filled with ones, so appending `1` increases its length to 6. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `earnings` is its original value minus the last element of `costs`, `happiness` is a list of length 6 filled with ones, `costs` is one element shorter than before and the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`**
