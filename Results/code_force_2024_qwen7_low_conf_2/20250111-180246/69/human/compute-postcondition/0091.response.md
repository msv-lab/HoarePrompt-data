The code `heapq.heappop(h)` pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` contains `-n`, and assuming the heap is a min-heap (which is typical), popping the smallest element will remove `-n`.

Given that `h` initially contains `-n`, after calling `heapq.heappop(h)`, `h` will no longer contain any elements. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`; `mx` is the maximum of its original value and 1 if `s >= l[3]` is true; `s` is `s_initial + n - m`; `cnt` is 0 or 1; `h` is an empty heap; `rs` is `[0]`; `i` is 3.**
