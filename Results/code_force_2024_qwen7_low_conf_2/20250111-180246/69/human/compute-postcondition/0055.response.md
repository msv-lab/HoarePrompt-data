The code `cnt = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `cnt`. This changes the value of `cnt` from its previous value (which was the number of times `s >= l[i]` was true) to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`, `mx` is 0, `s` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `h` is a heap, `rs` is a list with an additional element `cnt` appended, the remaining number of iterations left in the loop is 1.**
