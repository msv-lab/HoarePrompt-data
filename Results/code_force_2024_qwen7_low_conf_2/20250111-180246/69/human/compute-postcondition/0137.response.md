`cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `cnt` was either 1 or 2, so now it is either 2 or 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is either 1 or 2; `s` is equal to `s + m - l[i]`; `cnt` is either 2 or 3; `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]` twice and `-l[i]` (where `i` is either 2 or 3); `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is either 2 or 3; `n` is greater than 0.
