`earnings` is updated by subtracting the last element of the `costs` list from its current value. The previous value of `earnings` was `initial_earnings - 3 * costs[-1] + x`. After the subtraction, the new value of `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 3 * costs[-1] + x - costs[-1]`, which simplifies to `initial_earnings - 4 * costs[-1] + x`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 4 * costs[-1] + x`, `happiness` is a list `[1, 1, 1]`**
