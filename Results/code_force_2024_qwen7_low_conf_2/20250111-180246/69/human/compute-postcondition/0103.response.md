`s` is assigned the value `0`. All other variables retain their previous values. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing two integers (the split values of the input), `mx` is 0, `s` is 0, `cnt` is the total count of elements added to `s` without violating the condition, `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements added to `s` without violating the condition, `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents, `i` is `i + 1`.**
