`cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `cnt` was initially 0 or 1, so now it will be 1 or 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`, `mx` is the maximum of its original value and 1 if `s >= l[3]` is true, `s` is `s_initial + \text{if } l[3] < abs(h[0]) \text{ then } n \text{ else } m + m`, `cnt` is 1 or 2, `h` is a heap containing `-n` or `-m` (depending on the condition), `rs` is `[0]`, and `i` is 3.**
