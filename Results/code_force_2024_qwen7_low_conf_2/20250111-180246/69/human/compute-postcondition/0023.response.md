`costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. Since the initial state does not provide the exact values in the `costs` list, we only know that the last element is removed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 2 * costs[-1] + x`, `happiness` is a list `[1, 1]`, `costs` list has its last element removed**
