`s` is updated to `s - l[i]`. The value of `i` is either 2 or 3, depending on the previous value of `i`. Since `s` was previously updated to `s + m`, the current value of `s` is `s + m - l[i]`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing two integers, `mx` is either 1 or 2, `s` is equal to `s + m - l[i]`, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `h` is either a heap containing `-l[1]` twice (if `s >= l[i]`) or an empty heap (if `s < l[i]`), `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents, `i` is either 2 or 3 (depending on the previous value of `i`), `n` is greater than 0**.
