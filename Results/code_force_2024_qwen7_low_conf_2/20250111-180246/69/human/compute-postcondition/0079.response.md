The code `heapq.heappop(h)` pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Given the initial state, `h` is a list containing `-n`, which means `h` is a min-heap with one element `-n`.

After executing `heapq.heappop(h)`, the smallest element, which is `-n`, is removed from the heap. Since `h` initially contained only one element, it is now empty.

The output state is updated as follows:
- `h` is now an empty list.
- All other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`, `l`, `mx`, `s`, `cnt`, `rs`, and `i`) remain unchanged because the operation does not affect them.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `previous_value + 1` if `s >= l[i]` is true, `s` is `s_initial + n`, `cnt` is 0, `h` is an empty list, `rs` is `[0]`, and `i` is 1.**
