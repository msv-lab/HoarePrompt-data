`s` is incremented by `m`. The previous values of the affected variables are as follows:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`
- `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `previous_value + 1` if `s >= l[i]` is true
- `s` is either `abs(h[0]) - l[i]` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])` is true, or `abs(h[0])` if not
- `cnt` is 0
- `h` is a list containing `-n`
- `rs` is `[0]`
- `i` is 0

After executing `s += m`, the new value of `s` is the previous value of `s` plus `m`. Since the exact initial value of `s` is not given, we will denote it as `s_initial`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `previous_value + 1` if `s >= l[i]` is true, `s` is `s_initial + m`, `cnt` is 0, `h` is a list containing `-n`, `rs` is `[0]`, and `i` is 0.**
