Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is either 1 or 2; `s` is updated to `s + m` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])` and `s + l[1] - l[0]` if `h` is non-empty or `s - l[0]` if `h` is empty; `cnt` is either 1 or 2; `h` now contains `-l[1]` and `-l[2]` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])` or remains unchanged otherwise; `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is 3; `n` is greater than 0.***
