`mx` is assigned the maximum value between `mx` and `cnt`. Since `mx` can be either 1 or 2, and `cnt` is either 2 or 3, the maximum of these two values will be assigned to `mx`. Given that `cnt` is either 2 or 3, and `mx` is either 1 or 2, the maximum value will be `cnt` itself because `cnt` is at least 2 and `mx` is at most 2.

Therefore, the updated value of `mx` will be `cnt`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing two integers, `mx` is `cnt`, `s` is equal to `s + m - l[i]`, `cnt` is either 2 or 3, `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]` twice and `-l[i]` (where `i` is either 2 or 3), `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents, `i` is either 2 or 3, `n` is greater than 0.**
