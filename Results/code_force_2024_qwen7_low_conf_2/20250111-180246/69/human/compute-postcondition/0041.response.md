The code appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. Since `happiness` was initially a list of length 4 filled with ones, appending another `1` will make it a list of length 5 filled with ones.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `earnings` is its original value minus the last element of `costs`, `happiness` is a list of length 5 filled with ones, and `costs` must have at least two elements with the last element being less than or equal to `earnings`.**
