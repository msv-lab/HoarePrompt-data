The initial state is given as:
- `m` is greater than 0
- `i` is 1
- `earnings` is `earnings - costs[-1]`
- `happiness` is `[1]`
- `costs` must have at least one element and the last element must satisfy `costs[-1] <= earnings`

The code to be executed is:
```python
earnings -= costs[-1]
```

This line subtracts the last element of the `costs` list from `earnings`. Since the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`, this operation will modify `earnings`.

Given the initial state:
- `earnings` is already defined as `earnings - costs[-1]`, meaning `earnings` has already had its last cost subtracted before the current line of code.

The line `earnings -= costs[-1]` is redundant because `earnings` is already calculated as `earnings - costs[-1]` in the initial state. However, for the sake of the exercise, let's assume the current state of `earnings` before this line is `initial_earnings - costs[-1]`, and it will be further updated to `initial_earnings - 2*costs[-1]`.

Thus, after executing the code, the updated state will be:
- `m` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 1 (unchanged)
- `earnings` is now `initial_earnings - 2*costs[-1]` (updated)
- `happiness` is `[1]` (unchanged)
- `costs` must have at least one element and the last element must satisfy `costs[-1] <= earnings` (unchanged)

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 2*costs[-1]`; `happiness` is `[1]`; `costs` must have at least one element and the last element must satisfy `costs[-1] <= earnings`**
