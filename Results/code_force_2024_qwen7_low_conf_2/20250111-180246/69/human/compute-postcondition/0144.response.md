Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing two integers, `mx` is either 1 or 2, `s` is updated to `s + m`, `cnt` is either 2 or 3, `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]` twice and `-l[i]` where `i` is either 2 or 3 if `s >= l[i]`, otherwise `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]` and `-l[2]` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])` or remains unchanged otherwise, `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than 0.***
