The code `happiness.append(1)` appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. Initially, `happiness` is a list of length 1 with all elements being `1`. After appending `1`, the list `happiness` will have two elements, both being `1`. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `earnings`, and `costs`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 2 * costs[-1] + x`, `happiness` is a list `[1, 1]`**
