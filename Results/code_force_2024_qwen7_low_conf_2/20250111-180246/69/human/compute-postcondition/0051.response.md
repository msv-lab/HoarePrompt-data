Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m` (the total number of months), `x` (the monthly salary), and `costs` (a list of costs associated with increasing happiness). The function first sorts the `costs` list in descending order. It then iterates through each month, accumulating earnings by adding the monthly salary. During each iteration, it checks if the highest remaining cost can be afforded with the current earnings. If so, it reduces the earnings by that cost and records a unit of happiness. This process continues until either all months have passed or no more costs can be afforded. Finally, the function returns the total number of units of happiness achieved.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `costs` is an empty list, the function will return the length of the `happiness` list after processing all months. Since `happiness` is populated with ones based on the costs that could be afforded, and `costs` becomes an empty list by the end, the return value is simply the length of `happiness`.
- If `m` is zero or `x` is zero, the function will return 0 because no months will be processed and no happiness units will be earned.
- If all costs are greater than the accumulated earnings, the `happiness` list will remain empty, and the function will return 0.
