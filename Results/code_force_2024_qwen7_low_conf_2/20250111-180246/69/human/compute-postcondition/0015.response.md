The code appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. Initially, `happiness` is `[1, 1]`. After appending `1`, the list becomes `[1, 1, 1]`. The values of `m`, `i`, `earnings`, and `costs[-1]` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 3*costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1, 1, 1]`, and `costs[-1]` from the previous iteration is less than or equal to `earnings`**
