The code `heapq.heappop(h)` pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Given the initial conditions, the heap `h` contains either `-l[1]` twice (if `s >= l[2]`) or is empty (if `s < l[2]`). Since `h` cannot be empty at this point because we are performing `heappop`, it means `s >= l[2]`.

- Before popping, the heap `h` contains `-l[1]` twice.
- After popping, the smallest element, which is `-l[1]`, is removed from the heap.

Since `h` was a min-heap and we popped the smallest element, the heap now contains `-l[1]` once.

The states of other variables are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `h` now contains `-l[1]`.
- `s` remains unchanged because the element being popped is `-l[1]` and the operation does not directly involve `s`.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing two integers, `mx` is either 1 or 2, `s` is updated to `s + l[1] - l[0]` if `h` is non-empty or `s - l[0]` if `h` is empty, `cnt` is either 1 or 2, `h` now contains `-l[1]`, `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents, `i` is either 2 or 3 (depending on the previous value of `i`), `n` is greater than 0.**
