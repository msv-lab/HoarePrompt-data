`s` is decremented by `l[i]`. The initial value of `i` is 0, so `s` is decremented by `l[0]`, which is `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`; `mx` is 0; `s` is reduced by `n`; `cnt` is 0; `h` is an empty list `[]`; `rs` is a list with an additional element `cnt` appended; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; and the condition `s >= l[i]` is true (since `s` was initially greater than 0 and now `s` is reduced by `n`).

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`; `mx` is 0; `s` is reduced by `n`; `cnt` is 0; `h` is an empty list `[]`; `rs` is a list with an additional element `cnt` appended; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; and the condition `s >= l[i]` is true.**
