`earnings` is decremented by `costs[-1]`. The value of `costs[-1]` from the previous iteration is known to be less than or equal to `earnings` and is subtracted from `earnings`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated value of `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 2*costs[-1] - costs[-1] = initial_earnings - 3*costs[-1]`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 3*costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1, 1]`, and `costs[-1]` from the previous iteration is less than or equal to `earnings`**
