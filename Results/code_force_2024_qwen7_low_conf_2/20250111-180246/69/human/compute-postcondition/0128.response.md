The `heapq.heappop(h)` function pops and returns the smallest element from the heap `h`. Since `h` initially contains `-l[1]`, the smallest element (and thus the one being popped) is `-l[1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `l` is a list containing two integers
- `mx` is 1
- `s` is `s + m + abs(l[1]) - l[2]`
- `cnt` is 1
- `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`
- `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents
- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 0

After executing `heapq.heappop(h)`, the smallest element `-l[1]` is removed from the heap `h`. The heap `h` will now be empty.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is 1; `s` is `s + m + abs(l[1]) - l[2]`; `cnt` is 1; `h` is an empty heap; `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0.**
