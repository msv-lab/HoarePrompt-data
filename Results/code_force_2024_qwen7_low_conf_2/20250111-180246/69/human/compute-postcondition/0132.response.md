Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is either 1 or 2; `s` is adjusted according to the condition (`s + m - l[1]` if `s >= l[i]` and `s + m + abs(l[1]) - l[2]` otherwise); `cnt` is either 1 or 2; `h` is either a heap containing `-l[1]` twice (if `s >= l[i]`) or an empty heap (if `s < l[i]`); `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is either 1 or 2; `n` is greater than 0.***
