Output State: **`m` is a positive integer, `i` is `m`, `earnings` is the initial value of `earnings` minus the sum of all elements in the final `costs` list, `happiness` is a list of length `len(happiness) + len(costs)` filled with ones, and `costs` is an empty list.**

### Explanation:
- **`m`**: The loop runs exactly `m` times since the loop condition is `range(1, m + 1)`. After all iterations, `i` will be `m`.
- **`earnings`**: Initially, `earnings` is `0`. Each iteration, `x` is added to `earnings`, and if the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`, it is subtracted from `earnings`. This process continues until `costs` is empty. Therefore, after all iterations, `earnings` will be the initial `earnings` value minus the sum of all elements in the final `costs` list.
- **`happiness`**: Each time a cost is removed from `costs`, a `1` is appended to `happiness`. Since the loop runs `m` times, `happiness` will be a list of length `m` filled with `1`s.
- **`costs`**: The `while` loop continues to remove elements from `costs` as long as they are less than or equal to `earnings`. Once all elements that satisfy this condition are removed, `costs` will be empty.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the state of the variables will be as described above.
