`earnings` is initially calculated as `initial_earnings - 1 * costs[-1]`. The code `earnings += x` adds the value of `x` to `earnings`. Since the value of `x` is not specified in the initial state, we will denote it as `x`. Therefore, the new value of `earnings` is `initial_earnings - costs[-1] + x`.

The states of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `happiness`, and `costs`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - costs[-1] + x`, `happiness` is a list of length 1 with all elements being 1, and the `costs` list has had its last element removed**
