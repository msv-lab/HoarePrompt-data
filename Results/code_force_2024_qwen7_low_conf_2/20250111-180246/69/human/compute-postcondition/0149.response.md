The given code snippet simply prints the elements of the list `rs` separated by newlines. No variables are modified, and no new values are calculated or assigned. The only operation performed is the printing of the contents of `rs`.

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the last integer processed in the input for the last iteration; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list of integers obtained from the inputs for all iterations; `mx` is the maximum count of consecutive valid operations across all iterations; `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations, which is the sum of `m` multiplied by `t` plus any adjustments made during each iteration; `cnt` is the total count of elements added to `s` without violating the condition `s >= l[i]` across all iterations; `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements from `l` that were successfully subtracted from `s` and then pushed into the heap during all iterations; `rs` is a list containing the result of `cnt` for each iteration; `i` is `n` for the last iteration processed; the contents of `rs` are printed separated by newlines.**
