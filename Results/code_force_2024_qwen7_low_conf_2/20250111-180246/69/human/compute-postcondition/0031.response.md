The `costs.pop()` method removes the last element from the `costs` list. Given the initial state where `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 4 * costs[-1] + x`, and `happiness` is a list `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, the last element of the `costs` list is removed. This means the length of the `costs` list is reduced by one, and its last element is no longer present.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 4 * costs[-1] + x`, `happiness` is a list `[1, 1, 1, 1]` and the last element of `costs` has been removed.**
