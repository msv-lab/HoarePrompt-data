Let's break down the given information and the conditions for the `while` loop to determine which states need to be adjusted.

### Given Information:
- `m` must be greater than or equal to 3
- `i` is 3
- `earnings` is `initial_earnings + 2 * x`
- `happiness` is a list of length 3 filled with ones
- `costs` is an empty list

### Loop Condition:
```
while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition Breakdown**:
   - The loop continues as long as `costs` is non-empty (`costs != []`) and the last element in `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`.
   
2. **Initial States**:
   - `costs` is an empty list initially, so `costs and costs[-1]` evaluates to `False` because there is no last element to compare.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute at all based on the given initial states.

3. **Needed Adjustments**:
   - To make the loop execute at least once, we need to change the state such that `costs` becomes non-empty and the last element in `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`.
   - We need to add at least one element to `costs` such that the condition `costs and costs[-1] <= earnings` is satisfied.

### Conclusion:
Since `costs` is initially an empty list, we need to add at least one element to `costs` that satisfies `costs[-1] <= earnings`.

### Updated State:
State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `earnings` is `initial_earnings + 2 * x`, `happiness` is a list of length 3 filled with ones, and `costs` must contain at least one element such that the last element is less than or equal to `earnings`**

This ensures that the loop condition `costs and costs[-1] <= earnings` will be true for at least one iteration.
