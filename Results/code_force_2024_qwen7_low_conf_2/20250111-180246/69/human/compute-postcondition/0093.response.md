Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is the list containing `[n, m, ...]` with `l[3]` being `m`; `mx` is the maximum of its original value and 1 if `s >= l[3]` is true; `s` is `s_initial + n - m`; `cnt` is 0 or 1; `h` is a heap containing `-m`; `rs` is `[0]`; `i` is 3. If `l[i] < abs(h[0])` is true, then `s` is updated to `s_initial + n - m`. Otherwise, `s` remains unchanged.***
