The `costs.pop()` function removes the last element from the `costs` list. This operation changes the length of the `costs` list by reducing it by one and also updates the `earnings` variable, which was calculated as the original value of `earnings` minus the last element of `costs`. Since the last element of `costs` is now removed, the value subtracted from `earnings` no longer exists.

- The `m` variable remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
- The `i` variable remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
- The `happiness` list remains unchanged as it is not affected by this operation.
- The `earnings` variable is updated to its original value plus the value of the last element that was in `costs`.
- The `costs` list is reduced by one element, and the last element that was in `costs` is no longer there.

Given these points, the output state is:

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `earnings` is its original value plus the last element that was in `costs`, `happiness` is a list of length 6 filled with ones, `costs` is one element shorter than before and the last element of `costs` does not exist.**
