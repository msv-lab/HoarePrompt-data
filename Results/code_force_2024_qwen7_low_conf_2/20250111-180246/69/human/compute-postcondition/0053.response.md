The line `mx = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `mx`. This is the only assignment made in the code snippet. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`, `mx` is 0, `s` is `s + n * m`, `cnt` is the number of times `s >= l[i]` is true, `h` is a heap, `rs` is a list with an additional element `cnt` appended, the remaining number of iterations left in the loop is 1.**
