The code `earnings -= costs[-1]` subtracts the last element of the `costs` list from `earnings`. Given the initial conditions:

- `m` must be greater than or equal to 3,
- `i` is 3,
- `earnings` is `initial_earnings + 2 * x`,
- `happiness` is a list of length 3 filled with ones,
- `costs` contains at least one element such that the last element is less than or equal to `earnings`.

After executing the code, the value of `earnings` is updated by subtracting the last element of `costs` from its current value. Since the exact values of `initial_earnings` and `x` are not specified, we will represent the updated `earnings` as `initial_earnings + 2 * x - costs[-1]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `earnings` is `initial_earnings + 2 * x - costs[-1]`, `happiness` is a list of length 3 filled with ones, and `costs` contains at least one element such that the last element is less than or equal to `earnings`.**
