`cnt` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `previous_value + 1` if `s >= l[i]` is true, `s` is `s_initial`, `cnt` is 1, `h` is a list containing `-n`, `rs` is `[0]`, and `i` is 2.
