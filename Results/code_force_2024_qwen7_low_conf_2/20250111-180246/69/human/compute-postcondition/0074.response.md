`s` is decremented by `l[i]`. The value of `i` is 1, so `s` is decreased by `l[1]`. The previous value of `s` was `s_initial + m`. Since `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`, `l[1]` is `m`. Therefore, the new value of `s` is `(s_initial + m) - m = s_initial`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `previous_value + 1` if `s >= l[i]` is true, `s` is `s_initial`, `cnt` is 0, `h` is a list containing `-n`, `rs` is `[0]`, and `i` is 2.**
