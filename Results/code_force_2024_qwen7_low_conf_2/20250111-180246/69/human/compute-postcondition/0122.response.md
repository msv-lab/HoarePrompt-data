Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\).
   - `n` is the first integer from the input.
   - `m` is the second integer from the input.
   - `l` is a list containing two integers.
   - `mx` is 1.
   - `s` is `s + m`.
   - `cnt` is 1.
   - `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`.
   - `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   The for loop is defined as:
   ```python
   for i in range(n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs for each integer in the range from 0 to `n-1`.
   - Since `i` is initially set to 1, the loop will check if `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Current Value of Variables:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `n` is greater than 0.

5. **Next Iteration Check:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and still be less than `n`.
   - Incrementing `i` from 1 to 2, the condition `i < n` should still hold true.

6. **States to Adjust:**
   - `i` should be updated to 2.
   - `n` should remain the same and must still be greater than 0.

Therefore, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is 1; `s` is `s + m`; `cnt` is 1; `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`; `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0.**
