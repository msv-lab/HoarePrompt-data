The code appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. The initial state of `happiness` is `[1]`, so after appending `1`, the list `happiness` will be `[1, 1]`.

The values of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `earnings`, and `costs`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 2*costs[-1]`; `happiness` is `[1, 1]`; `costs` must have at least one element and the last element must satisfy `costs[-1] <= earnings`**
