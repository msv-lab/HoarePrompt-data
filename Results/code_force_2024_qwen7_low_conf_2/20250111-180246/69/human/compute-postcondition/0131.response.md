Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is 1; `s` is `s + m + abs(l[1]) - l[2]`; `cnt` is 1; `h` is an empty heap; `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is 2; `n` is greater than 0.***

Explanation: Since the else part is not provided, we consider the if part as the entire if-else block. Therefore, the postcondition of the if part directly becomes the overall postcondition of the if-else block.
