The code updates the variable `mx` to be the maximum value between `mx` and `cnt`. Given that `mx` is initially 0 and `cnt` is 1, the new value of `mx` will be 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is 1; `s` is decreased by `l[i]`; `cnt` is 1; `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`; `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0**
