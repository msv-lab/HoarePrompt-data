The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m` (a positive integer representing the total number of months), `x` (a positive integer representing the monthly salary), and `costs` (a list of positive integers where `costs[i]` represents the cost of one unit of happiness in the i-th month). 

Given that `costs` is an empty list, the function returns the length of the happiness list, which is `len(happiness) + len(costs)`. Since `costs` is empty, the length is just `len(happiness)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `m`, `x`, and `costs`, and if `costs` is an empty list, it returns the length of the happiness list.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `m`, `x`, and `costs`, and if `costs` is an empty list, it returns the length of the happiness list.**
