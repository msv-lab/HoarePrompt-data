The code appends the value `1` to the list `happiness`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of the `happiness` list, we can only say that `happiness` now contains the value `1`. The values of the other variables (`m`, `i`, and `earnings`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `earnings` is `earnings - costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1]`**
