The code initializes an empty list for `h`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value for `h` and retains the pre-existing values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`, `mx` is 0, `s` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `h` is an empty list `[]`, `rs` is a list with an additional element `cnt` appended, the remaining number of iterations left in the loop is 1.**
