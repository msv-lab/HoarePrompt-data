`costs.pop()` removes the last element from the list `costs`. Since the initial value of `costs` is not specified in detail, let's assume it is a list containing at least one element. After removing the last element, the length of `costs` will decrease by one. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `earnings`, and `happiness`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 3 * costs[-1] + x`, `happiness` is a list `[1, 1, 1]`, `costs` has its last element removed.**
