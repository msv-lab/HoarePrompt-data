Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` remains 0; `s` remains unchanged as `s < l[i]` and the condition `l[i] < abs(h[0])` is false; `cnt` is 0; `h` is a list containing `-l[1]`; `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0; `s` is less than `l[i]` since the else part does not change these variables and the if condition is always met based on the given preconditions.***
