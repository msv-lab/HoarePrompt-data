`cnt` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `cnt` was 1, so the new value of `cnt` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is 1; `s` is `s + m - l[1]`; `cnt` is 2; `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]` twice (after adjustment to maintain heap property); `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is 1.**
