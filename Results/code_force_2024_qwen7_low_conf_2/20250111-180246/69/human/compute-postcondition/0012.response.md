The `costs.pop()` method removes the last element from the `costs` list. Since the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings` and `costs` has at least one element, the last element is removed.

The `earnings` variable is defined as `initial_earnings - 2 * costs[-1]`. After removing the last element, the new last element (which is now the second last element) would affect the `earnings` if recalculated, but the problem does not specify a recalculation of `earnings`, so we assume `earnings` remains unchanged unless explicitly recalculated.

The `happiness` list remains unchanged, and `m` and `i` are also unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0; `i` is 1; `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 2*costs[-1]`; `happiness` is `[1, 1]`; `costs` has one less element than before.**
