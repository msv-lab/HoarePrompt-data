To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and analyze each variable involved in the loop.

### Given Information:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) (this value does not change within the loop).
- `n` is the first integer from the input.
- `m` is the second integer from the input.
- `l` is a list containing the elements added by the loop.
- `mx` is the maximum count of consecutive elements added to `s` without violating the condition `s >= l[i]`.
- `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations.
- `cnt` is the total count of elements added to `s` without violating the condition.
- `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements added to `s` without violating the condition.
- `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents.
- `i` is the last index processed by the loop.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates for as many times as there are inputs (`int(input())`).

2. **Input Handling**: Each iteration processes one new input value. This means `i` will be incremented by 1 for each iteration.

3. **Variables Involved**:
   - `mx`: The maximum count of consecutive elements added to `s` without violating the condition `s >= l[i]`. This value may or may not change with each iteration but will be reset if a violation occurs.
   - `s`: The value of `s` will be updated based on the current input value and the condition `s >= l[i]`.
   - `cnt`: The count of elements added to `s` without violating the condition will increment each time the condition holds true.
   - `h`: The heap will contain the negative values of the elements added to `s` without violating the condition.
   - `rs`: This list will store the cumulative counts of elements added to `s` without violating the condition.
   - `i`: This is the index of the current input value being processed.

### Adjusted States:
At the start of the next iteration:
- `i` will be increased by 1 from its current value.
- `mx`, `s`, `cnt`, `h`, and `rs` will retain their values from the previous iteration unless a new input violates the condition.

Given this, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing the elements added by the loop, `mx` is the maximum count of consecutive elements added to `s` without violating the condition `s >= l[i]`, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations, `cnt` is the total count of elements added to `s` without violating the condition, `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements added to `s` without violating the condition, `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents, and `i` is `i + 1`**.

So, the adjusted state is:
State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing the elements added by the loop, `mx` is the maximum count of consecutive elements added to `s` without violating the condition `s >= l[i]`, `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations, `cnt` is the total count of elements added to `s` without violating the condition, `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements added to `s` without violating the condition, `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents, and `i` is `i + 1`**.
