`earnings` is decremented by the value of the last element in the `costs` list. Since the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`, `earnings` will now be the value of its original value minus the last element of `costs`. The other variables (`m`, `i`, `happiness`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `earnings` is its original value minus the last element of `costs`, `happiness` is a list of length 4 filled with ones, and `costs` must have at least two elements with the last element being less than or equal to `earnings`.**
