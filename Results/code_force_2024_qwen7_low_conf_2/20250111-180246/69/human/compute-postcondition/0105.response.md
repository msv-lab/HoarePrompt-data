The code initializes `h` as an empty list. This does not affect the values of any other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing two integers (the split values of the input), `mx` is 0, `s` is 0, `cnt` is 0, `h` is an empty list, `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents, `i` is `i + 1`.**
