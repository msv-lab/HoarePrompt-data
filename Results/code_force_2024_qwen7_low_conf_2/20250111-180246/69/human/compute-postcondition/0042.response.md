The code `costs.pop()` removes the last element from the `costs` list. Since the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`, removing it does not affect the condition specified. The value of `earnings` remains unchanged, and the `happiness` list remains a list of length 5 filled with ones. The `m` and `i` variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `earnings` is its original value minus the last element of `costs`, `happiness` is a list of length 5 filled with ones, `costs` has at least one element less than or equal to `earnings` and is one element shorter than before.**
