The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `n` and `m` respectively. This changes the values of `n` and `m` but does not affect the other variables.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\)
- `n` is the first integer from the input
- `m` is the second integer from the input
- `l` is a list containing the elements added by the loop
- `mx` is the maximum count of consecutive elements added to `s` without violating the condition `s >= l[i]`
- `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations
- `cnt` is the total count of elements added to `s` without violating the condition
- `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements added to `s` without violating the condition
- `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents
- `i` is `i + 1`

After executing the code, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing the elements added by the loop; `mx` is the maximum count of consecutive elements added to `s` without violating the condition `s >= l[i]`; `s` is the final value of `s` after all iterations; `cnt` is the total count of elements added to `s` without violating the condition; `h` is a heap containing the negative values of the elements added to `s` without violating the condition; `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is `i + 1`.**
