`earnings` is updated by adding `x` to its current value. The original value of `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 3 * costs[-1] + x`. Since `costs` is an empty list, `costs[-1]` does not exist and would result in an error if accessed directly. However, since the code only updates `earnings` by adding `x` to its current value, the current value of `earnings` before this line of code is what matters.

Given that the initial state includes `earnings` as `initial_earnings - 3 * costs[-1] + x`, and assuming `costs[-1]` is not accessed (or is considered as 0), the new value of `earnings` is the previous value of `earnings` plus `x`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 3 * 0 + x + x` (which simplifies to `initial_earnings + 2 * x`), `happiness` is a list of length 3 filled with ones, and `costs` is an empty list.

Output State: **`m` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `earnings` is `initial_earnings + 2 * x`, `happiness` is a list of length 3 filled with ones, and `costs` is an empty list.**
