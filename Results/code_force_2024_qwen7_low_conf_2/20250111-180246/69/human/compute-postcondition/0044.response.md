`earnings` is decreased by the last element of `costs`. Given that the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`, the new value of `earnings` is the original value of `earnings` minus the last element of `costs`. The states of the other variables (`m`, `i`, `happiness`, and `costs`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `earnings` is its original value minus the last element of `costs`, `happiness` is a list of length 5 filled with ones, `costs` is one element shorter than before and the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`**
