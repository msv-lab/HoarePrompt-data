`earnings` is decreased by `costs[-1]`. Since `costs[-1]` is one of the elements in the list `costs`, and its specific value is not provided, we can denote it as `costs[-1]`. The value of `m` and `i` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `earnings` is `earnings - costs[-1]`.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `earnings` is `earnings - costs[-1]`**
