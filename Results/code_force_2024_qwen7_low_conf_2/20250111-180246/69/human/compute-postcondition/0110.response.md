The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Initially, `cnt` is 0. Therefore, after executing this line of code, `cnt` will be 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is 0; `s` is decreased by `l[i]`; `cnt` is 1; `h` is a heap containing `-l[1]`; `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 0**
