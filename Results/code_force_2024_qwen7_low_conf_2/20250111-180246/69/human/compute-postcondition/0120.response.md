Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing two integers; `mx` is 1; `s` is decreased by `l[i]` and `cnt` is 1, making `h` a heap containing `-l[1]` and `rs` a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents, where `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than 0. If the condition `s < l[i]` holds, `mx` remains 0, `s` remains unchanged, `cnt` is 0, `h` is a list containing `-l[1]`, `rs` is a list containing the final value of `cnt` appended to its previous contents, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0.***
