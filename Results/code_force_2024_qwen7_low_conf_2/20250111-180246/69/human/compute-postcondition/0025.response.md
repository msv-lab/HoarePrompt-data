The initial state includes `m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 2 * costs[-1] + x`, `happiness` is a list `[1, 1]`, and `costs` list must have at least two elements and its last element must be less than or equal to `earnings` before the last element is removed.

The code snippet `earnings -= costs[-1]` means that the last element of the `costs` list (let's denote it as `costs[-1]`) is subtracted from `earnings`.

Since the last element of `costs` is less than or equal to `earnings`, this operation will not change the condition that `earnings` is greater than 0. The value of `earnings` will be updated to `initial_earnings - 2 * costs[-1] + x - costs[-1]`, which simplifies to `initial_earnings - 3 * costs[-1] + x`.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `m` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `i` is 2 (unchanged)
- `earnings` is now `initial_earnings - 3 * costs[-1] + x`
- `happiness` is a list `[1, 1]` (unchanged)
- `costs` list is unchanged in terms of its length and content except that its last element has been effectively subtracted from `earnings`

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `earnings` is `initial_earnings - 3 * costs[-1] + x`, `happiness` is a list `[1, 1]`**
