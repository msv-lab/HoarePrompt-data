Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\), `n` is the first integer from the input, `m` is the second integer from the input, `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`, `mx` is the maximum of `mx` and `previous_value + 1` if `s >= l[i]` is true, `s` is reduced by `n` if `s >= l[i]` is true, `cnt` is its previous value + 1 if `s >= l[i]` is true, `h` is a heap containing `-n` if `s >= l[i]` is true, `rs` is a list with an additional element `cnt` appended if `s >= l[i]` is true, `i` is 0; otherwise, `mx` is 0, `s` is either `abs(h[0]) - l[i]` if `l[i] < abs(h[0])` is true, or `abs(h[0])` if not, `cnt` is 0, `h` is a list containing `-n`, `rs` is `[0]`, and `i` is 0.***
