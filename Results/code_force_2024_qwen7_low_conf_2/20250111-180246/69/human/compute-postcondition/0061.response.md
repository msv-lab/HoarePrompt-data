`cnt` is incremented by 1, which means `cnt` is now equal to its previous value plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing `[n, m]`; `mx` is 0; `s` is reduced by `n`; `cnt` is its previous value + 1; `h` is a heap containing `-n`; `rs` is a list with an additional element `cnt` appended; `i` is 0; `n` is greater than 0; and the condition `s >= l[i]` is true.**
