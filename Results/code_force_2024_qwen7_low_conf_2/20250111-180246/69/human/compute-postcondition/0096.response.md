`s` is updated by adding `m` to its current value. The previous definition of `s` was either `s_initial + \text{if } l[3] < abs(h[0]) \text{ then } n \text{ else } m + m` or `s_initial + n - m` depending on the condition. After this operation, the new value of `s` will be the old value of `s` plus `m`. 

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\); `n` is the first integer from the input; `m` is the second integer from the input; `l` is a list containing `[n, m, ...]` with `l[3]` being `m` or `n` depending on the condition; `mx` is the maximum of its original value and `cnt` if `s >= l[3]` is true, otherwise it is the maximum of its original value and 1; `s` is either `s_initial + \text{if } l[3] < abs(h[0]) \text{ then } n \text{ else } m + m + m` or `s_initial + n - m + m`; `cnt` is 0, 1, or 2; `h` is a heap containing `-n` or `-m` (depending on the condition); `rs` is `[0]`; `i` is 3.**
