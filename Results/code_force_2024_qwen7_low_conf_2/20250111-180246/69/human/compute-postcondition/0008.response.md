The `pop()` method removes the last element from the `costs` list. Since `costs` was not specified initially, we cannot determine the exact value of the last element, but we know it will be removed. The values of `m`, `i`, `earnings`, and `happiness` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `earnings` is `earnings - costs[-1]`, `happiness` is `[1]`, `costs` does not have its last element.**
