The `costs.sort(reverse=True)` line sorts the `costs` list in descending order. This means the highest cost will be at index 0, the second highest at index 1, and so on. The values of `m` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer representing the total number of months; `x` is a positive integer representing the monthly salary; `costs` is a list of positive integers sorted in descending order.**
