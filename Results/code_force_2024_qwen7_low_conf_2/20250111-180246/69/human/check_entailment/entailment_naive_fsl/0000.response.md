Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle cases where the cost of happiness units in subsequent months decreases. Specifically, consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2
  4 3 1 2
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

In this case, the program sorts the costs in descending order and iterates through them. However, it does not account for the fact that after buying a happiness unit in the third month (cost = 1), Charlie still has 2 pounds left from the fourth month's salary. He can then buy another happiness unit in the fourth month, resulting in a total of 2 units of happiness. The program incorrectly calculates the happiness as 3 units because it does not properly handle the remaining balance after each purchase.
