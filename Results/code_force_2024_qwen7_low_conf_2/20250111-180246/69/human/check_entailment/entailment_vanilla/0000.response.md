Reasoning:
1. The program is designed to maximize the amount of happiness Charlie can achieve given the constraints.
2. The function `func_1` takes three parameters: `m` (number of months), `x` (monthly salary), and `costs` (list of happiness costs for each month).
3. The main logic of the program involves sorting the `costs` list in descending order and then iterating through each month to calculate the maximum happiness Charlie can buy.
4. During each iteration:
   - Charlie's earnings are updated by adding his monthly salary `x`.
   - While there are remaining happiness costs that Charlie can afford (`costs[-1] <= earnings`), he buys one unit of happiness, reducing his earnings by the cost and increasing the happiness count.
5. This approach ensures that Charlie always buys happiness when he has the maximum possible amount of money available, which aligns with the problem's goal of maximizing happiness.
6. The program correctly handles the constraints and examples provided in the problem statement.

Given the above reasoning, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
