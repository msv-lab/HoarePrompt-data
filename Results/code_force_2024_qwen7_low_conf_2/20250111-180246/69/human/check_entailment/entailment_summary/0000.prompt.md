You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the provided problem description and its execution summary. You can use the execution summary as a guide to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.

# Problem:
You can never buy enough happiness, so here we go again! In this version, you
can only buy h_i = 1 unit of happiness each month, but the number of months is
hugely increased. We are in the realm of quantum happiness and time dilation.

Being a physicist, Charlie likes to plan his life in simple and precise terms.

For the next m months, starting with no money, Charlie will work hard and earn
x pounds per month. For the i -th month (1 \le i \le m) , there'll be a single
opportunity of paying cost c_i pounds to obtain one unit of happiness. You
cannot buy more than one unit each month.

Borrowing is not allowed. Money earned in the i -th month can only be spent in
a later j -th month (j>i ).

Since physicists don't code, help Charlie find the maximum reachable units of
happiness.

Input

The first line of the input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers, m and x (1 \le m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 1 \le x \le 10^3 ) — the total number of months and the monthly
salary.

The second line of each test case contains m integers c_1, c_2, \dots, c_m (1
\leq c_i \leq 10^3 ) — the cost of one unit of happiness for each month.

It is guaranteed that sum of m over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output one integer — the maximal amount of happiness
Charlie can get.

# Program:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (m, x) = map(int, input().split())
    costs = list(map(int, input().split()))
    print(func_1(m, x, costs))

def func_1(m, x, costs):
    costs.sort(reverse=True)
    earnings = 0
    happiness = []
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        earnings += x
        while costs and costs[-1] <= earnings:
            earnings -= costs[-1]
            happiness.append(1)
            costs.pop()
    return len(happiness)





# Execution Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `m` (the total number of months), `x` (the monthly salary), and `costs` (a list of costs associated with increasing happiness). The function first sorts the `costs` list in descending order. It then iterates through each month, accumulating earnings by adding the monthly salary. During each iteration, it checks if the highest remaining cost can be afforded with the current earnings. If so, it reduces the earnings by that cost and records a unit of happiness. This process continues until either all months have passed or no more costs can be afforded. Finally, the function returns the total number of units of happiness achieved.
