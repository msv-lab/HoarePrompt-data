Reasoning:
The given program appears to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the number of test cases and processes each test case individually.
2. **Cost Sorting**: The costs are sorted in descending order to always consider the most expensive happiness unit first.
3. **Earnings Accumulation**: For each month, Charlie earns a fixed amount (`x`) which is added to his total earnings.
4. **Happiness Purchase Check**: During each month, the program checks if the highest remaining cost can be afforded with the current earnings. If so, it deducts the cost from the earnings and increments the happiness count.
5. **Loop Termination**: The loop continues until all months have been processed or no more costs can be afforded.
6. **Output**: The final happiness count is printed for each test case.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum reachable units of happiness for each test case.

Correctness: **True**
