#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the array a, and a is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9].
def func():
    t = int(input())
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(input())
        
        a = list(map(int, input().split()))
        
        a.sort()
        
        median_index = (n - 1) // 2
        
        median = a[median_index]
        
        operations = 0
        
        for i in range(median_index, n):
            if a[i] < median + 1:
                operations += median + 1 - a[i]
        
        results.append(operations)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, `results` is a list containing the operations count for each input set, `n` and `a` are as defined in the loop for each iteration, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `median` is the element at index `median_index` in the sorted list `a`, and `operations` is the sum of all differences `(median + 1 - a[i])` for each `i` in the range `(median_index, n)` where `a[i] < median + 1`.
    print('\n'.join(map(str, results)))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it accepts an integer `t`, an integer `n`, and a list `a` of `n` integers. It sorts the list `a` and calculates the median. Then, it counts the number of operations required to make all elements in the second half of the list `a` greater than or equal to `median + 1`. This count is stored in the `results` list. After processing all test cases, the function prints the results list, which contains the operation count for each test case. Potential edge cases include scenarios where the list `a` might contain duplicate elements or when `t` is 0. There is no explicit handling for these edge cases in the code, so the function will still execute correctly in these scenarios. However, if `t` is 0, the `results` list will be empty.
