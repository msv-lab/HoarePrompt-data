The code assigns the value of `a[median_index]` to `median`. Since `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, the value of `median` becomes `a[(n - 1) // 2]`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is `a[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is the sum of all differences `(median + 1 - a[i])` for each `i` in the range `(median_index, n)` where `a[i] < median + 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.**
