`cnt` is incremented by 1. The value of `cnt` was 2, so now it is 3. All other variables remain unchanged and still satisfy the conditions specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be increased to ensure `m + 1 < n`, `m` is now `m + 1`, `a[m]` is a value, `a[m + 1]` is a value + 1, `cnt` is 3, and the loop condition `m + 1 < n` and `a[m + 1] < a[m]` must still hold true.**
