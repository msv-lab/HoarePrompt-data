Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variable**: The loop variable in the given for loop is `_`. This is typically used as a throwaway variable when we don't care about the value of the loop index.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs `t` times, where `t` is the input integer (positive). For the loop to execute, `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **State Adjustments**:
   - `t` must be greater than 0 for the loop to run.
   - `n` and `a` are not yet defined, so they do not need to be adjusted unless the loop body modifies them.
   - `results` is an empty list, and since the loop body is omitted, the initial state of `results` does not affect the loop's execution.

Therefore, the key states that need adjustment for the loop to execute are `t` must be greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
