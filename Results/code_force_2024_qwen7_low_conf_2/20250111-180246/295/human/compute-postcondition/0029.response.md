Postcondition: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `median_index`, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is initialized to `median_index`, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`**
