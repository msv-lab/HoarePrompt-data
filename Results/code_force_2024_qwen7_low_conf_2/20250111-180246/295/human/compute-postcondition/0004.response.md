`a` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping `int` over the input split by spaces. The input is an integer list provided by the user, and since `n` is the number of elements in this list, `a` will have `n` elements, each converted to integers. The initial state that `t` is greater than 0 is not directly affected by the code, and `n` is still an input integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created from the input**
