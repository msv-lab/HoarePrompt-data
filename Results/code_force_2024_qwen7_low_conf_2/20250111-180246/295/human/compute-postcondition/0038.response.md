Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `median_index`, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is the sum of all increments performed by the loop (each increment being `median + 1 - a[i]` when `a[i] < median + 1`), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, and `i` is `n`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Conditions**: The initial conditions are `t > 1`, `n` is an integer, `median_index = (n - 1) // 2`, `a` is a sorted list, `median = a[median_index]`, `operations = 0`, and `results` is a list containing `operations`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates from `median_index` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, if `a[i] < median + 1`, `operations` is incremented by `median + 1 - a[i]`.

3. **Final Values**:
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `n-1` and then exits.
   - `operations` will be the sum of all increments performed during the loop, each time `a[i] < median + 1`.
   - `results` will still contain only the final value of `operations` since it is updated but not extended during the loop.

4. **Case When Loop Does Not Execute**:
   - If the list `a` is such that all elements are greater than or equal to `median + 1`, the loop will not execute at all. In this case, `operations` will remain 0, and `results` will still be a list containing 0.
