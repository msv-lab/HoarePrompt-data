The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. This means that `a` now contains the integers entered by the user.

- The initial state of `t` is greater than 1.
- `n` remains an input integer.
- `median_index` is still `(n - 1) // 2`.
- `a` is now updated to a list of integers entered by the user.
- `median` is still `a[n - 1] // 2`.
- `operations` is the sum of all differences `(median + 1 - a[i])` for each `i` in the range `(median_index, n)` where `a[i] < median + 1`.
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.

Since the code does not directly change the values of `t`, `n`, `median_index`, `median`, or `results`, these remain as described in the initial state. However, `a` is now a list of integers entered by the user.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `a` is a list of integers entered by the user, `median` is `a[n - 1] // 2`, `operations` is the sum of all differences `(median + 1 - a[i])` for each `i` in the range `(median_index, n)` where `a[i] < median + 1`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`**
