The code `operations += median + 1 - a[i]` updates the value of `operations`. Given that `median` is equal to `a[(n - 1) // 2]` and `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`, we can substitute `median` with `a[(n - 1) // 2]` in the expression.

Let's break down the expression:
- `median + 1` is `a[(n - 1) // 2] + 1`
- `a[i]` is less than `a[(n - 1) // 2] + 1`

So, `median + 1 - a[i]` is a positive number since `a[i]` is less than `a[(n - 1) // 2] + 1`.

Let's denote this positive difference as `positive_difference`. Therefore, `operations` is increased by `positive_difference`.

The output state is: `total` is not relevant, `n` must be greater than 1, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `median` is equal to \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is increased by a positive difference (which is `median + 1 - a[i]`), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations`, `i` is `median_index`. 

Output State: **`total` is not relevant, `n` must be greater than 1, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `median` is equal to \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is increased by `median + 1 - a[i]`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations`, `i` is `median_index`.**
