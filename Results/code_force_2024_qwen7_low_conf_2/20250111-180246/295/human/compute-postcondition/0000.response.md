`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. The values of `n` and `a` are not yet defined as they depend on the subsequent inputs for each test case. The precondition that `t` is a positive integer is preserved.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (positive), `n` and `a` are not yet defined**
