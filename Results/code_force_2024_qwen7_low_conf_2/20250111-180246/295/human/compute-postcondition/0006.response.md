The code assigns the value `(n - 1) // 2` to the variable `median_index`. Since `n` is an input integer, the exact value of `median_index` depends on the value of `n`. However, it is known that `median_index` will be the floor division of `(n - 1)` by 2. The other variables (`t`, `n`, and `a`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is (n - 1) // 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order**
