The code snippet updates the value of `n` by assigning it the integer value of user input. The initial values of the other variables (`t`, `median_index`, `a`, `median`, `operations`, `results`, and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer equal to the input from the user, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is the sum of all increments performed by the loop, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations`, and `i` is `n`.**
