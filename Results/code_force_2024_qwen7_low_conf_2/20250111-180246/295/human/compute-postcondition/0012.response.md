Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is (n - 1) // 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is a[n - 1] // 2, and `operations` is updated by adding `(median + 1 - a[i])` to the original value of `operations` if `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`. If `a[i]` is not less than `median + 1`, `operations` remains unchanged.***
