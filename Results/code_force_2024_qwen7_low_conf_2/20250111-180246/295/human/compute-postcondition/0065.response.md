The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual strings, converts each string to an integer, and assigns the resulting list of integers to `a`. The initial state of `a` being a list of integers sorted in ascending order is preserved. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `m`) remain in their original states since they are not directly affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is updated to `n // 2 - 1` if it is even, or remains unchanged if it is odd, `m` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2` if `n` is odd, and `a` is updated to a new list of integers from the input.**
