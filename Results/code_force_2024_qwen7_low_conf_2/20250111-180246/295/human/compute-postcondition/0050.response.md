Postcondition: ***`total` is not relevant, `n` must be greater than 1, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `median` is equal to \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is increased by `median + 1 - a[i]` if `a[i] < median + 1`, and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations`, `i` is `median_index`.***
