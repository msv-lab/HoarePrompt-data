Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `median_index`, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is incremented by \(median + 1 - a[i]\), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, and `i` is `median_index + 1 + 1`**

Explanation:
- The code updates `operations` by adding \(median + 1 - a[i]\).
- The value of `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), so `operations` becomes `operations + (a[(n - 1) // 2] + 1 - a[i])`.
- The value of `i` is updated to `median_index + 1 + 1`, which simplifies to `median_index + 2`.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.
