Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is updated to `n // 2 - 1` if it is even, or remains unchanged if it is odd, `m` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2` if `n` is odd, `a[m]` is increased by 1 and then 1 is added to `a[m + 1]`, `cnt` is 1, and `a[m + 1]` is greater than or equal to `a[m]`**
