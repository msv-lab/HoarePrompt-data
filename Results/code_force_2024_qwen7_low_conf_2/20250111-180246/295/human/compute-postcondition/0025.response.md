The code does not change the value of `median_index`; it only reassigns the variable `median_index` to the same value it already had. The initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is `a[n - 1] // 2`, `operations` is the sum of all differences `(median + 1 - a[i])` for each `i` in the range `(median_index, n)` where `a[i] < median + 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.**
