`operations` is incremented by the value of `median + 1 - a[i]`. Given that `median` is `a[n - 1] // 2`, and `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`, the value of `median + 1 - a[i]` is a positive integer. The exact value depends on the specific values of `median` and `a[i]`, but it is known to be a positive integer.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `t` is greater than 0 (unchanged)
- `n` is an input integer (unchanged)
- `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2` (unchanged)
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order (unchanged)
- `median` is `a[n - 1] // 2` (unchanged)
- `operations` is now `operations + (median + 1 - a[i])`

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is (n - 1) // 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is a[n - 1] // 2, `operations` is operations + (median + 1 - a[i])**
