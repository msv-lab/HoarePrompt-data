The code appends the current value of `operations` to the list `results`. This means that `operations`, which is the sum of all increments performed by the loop, is added to `results`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is greater than 1
- `n` is an integer greater than `median_index`
- `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\)
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
- `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\)
- `operations` is the sum of all increments performed by the loop (each increment being `median + 1 - a[i]` when `a[i] < median + 1`)
- `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`
- `i` is `n`

After executing the line `results.append(operations)`, the value of `operations` is added to the list `results`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `median_index`, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is the sum of all increments performed by the loop (each increment being `median + 1 - a[i]` when `a[i] < median + 1`), `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations`, and `i` is `n`.**
