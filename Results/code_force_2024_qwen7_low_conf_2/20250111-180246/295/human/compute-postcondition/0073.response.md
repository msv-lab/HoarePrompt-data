`cnt` is assigned the value `1`. The values of `a`, `t`, `n`, `m`, and `a[m]` are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the only change is that `cnt` now has the value `1`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is updated to `n // 2 - 1` if it is even, or remains unchanged if it is odd, `m` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2` if `n` is odd, `a[m]` is increased by 1, `cnt` is 1**
