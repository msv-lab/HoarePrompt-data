The line `operations = 0` sets the variable `operations` to 0. This changes the value of `operations` from its previous value (the sum of all differences as defined in the initial state) to 0. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is `a[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is 0, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.**
