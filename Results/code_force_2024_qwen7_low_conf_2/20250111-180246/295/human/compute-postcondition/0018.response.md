Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is \(a[n - 1] // 2\), and `operations` is updated. If `a[i] < median + 1`, then `operations` is the old value of `operations` plus \(\frac{a[n - 1]}{2} + 1 - a[((n - 1) // 2) + 1]\), and `i` is \(((n - 1) // 2) + 1\). Since there is no else part, no additional changes occur in the case where `a[i] >= median + 1`.***
