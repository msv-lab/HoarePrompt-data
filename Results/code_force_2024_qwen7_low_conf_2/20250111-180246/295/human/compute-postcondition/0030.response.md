`operations` is incremented by the value of `median + 1 - a[i]`. Given that `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`, the value of `median + 1 - a[i]` is a positive integer. Since `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and `a[i]` is the current value of `a[i]`, the exact value of `median + 1 - a[i]` cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `a[i]`, `median`, and `n`. However, we know it is a positive integer.

The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `median_index`, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is 0 plus a positive integer, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is initialized to `median_index`, and the current value of `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`**
