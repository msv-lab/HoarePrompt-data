Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the final value of `n` after all updates, `m` is the final value of `m` after all updates, `a[m]` is the last incremented value, `a[m + 1]` is the value after incrementing, and `cnt` is the total number of iterations. The loop will continue to execute as long as `m + 1 < n` and `a[m + 1] < a[m]`. After the loop ends, all elements in `a` between indices `m` and `n-1` will be in non-decreasing order.**
