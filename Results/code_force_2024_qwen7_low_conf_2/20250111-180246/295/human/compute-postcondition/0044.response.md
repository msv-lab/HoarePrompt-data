The code `median_index = (n - 1) // 2` does not change any variables. It simply reassigns the value of `median_index` based on the current value of `n`. Since `n` is an integer equal to the user input and `median_index` is defined as `(n - 1) // 2`, the value of `median_index` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer equal to the user input, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is the sum of all increments performed by the loop, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations`, `i` is `n`, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\)**
