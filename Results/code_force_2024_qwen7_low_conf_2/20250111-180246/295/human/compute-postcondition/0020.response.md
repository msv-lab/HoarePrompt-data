The code snippet appends the value of `operations` to the list `results`. The value of `operations` is already defined in the initial state, and the code does not modify its value or the values of other variables directly. Therefore, the only change is that `operations` is added to the list `results`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is `a[n - 1] // 2`, and `operations` is the sum of all differences `(median + 1 - a[i])` for each `i` in the range `(median_index, n)` where `a[i] < median + 1`; `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`.**
