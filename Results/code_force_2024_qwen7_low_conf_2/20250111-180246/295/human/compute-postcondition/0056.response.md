Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `median` is equal to \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), and `operations` is updated if \(a[i] < median + 1\). Specifically, if \(a[i] < median + 1\), `operations` is updated to `operations + (median + 1 - a[i])`. The `results` list contains the value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations` regardless of the condition.***
