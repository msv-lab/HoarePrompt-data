Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `median_index`, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is incremented by `median + 1 - a[i]` if `a[i] < median + 1`, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, `i` is `median_index + 3***
