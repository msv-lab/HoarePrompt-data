The code `cnt += 1` increments the value of `cnt` by 1. Given the initial state, `cnt` was previously 3, so now `cnt` is 4.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` must be at least \(m + 2\), `m` is now \(m + 1\), `a[m]` is a value, `a[m + 1]` is a value + 2, `cnt` is 4**.
