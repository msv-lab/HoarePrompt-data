Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is \(a[n - 1] // 2\), and `operations` is updated. Specifically, if \(a[i] < median + 1\), then `operations` is updated to `operations + (median + 1 - a[i])`. Otherwise, `operations` remains unchanged.***
