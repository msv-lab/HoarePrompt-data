Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is updated to `n // 2 - 1` if it is even, or remains unchanged if it is odd, `m` is `n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2` if `n` is odd, and `a[m]` is increased by 1. If `a[m - 1] <= a[m]` and `a[m] <= a[m + 1]`, the console outputs `1`. Otherwise, `a[m]` is the last incremented value, `a[m + 1]` is the value after incrementing, and all elements in `a` between indices `m` and `n-1` are in non-decreasing order.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the conditions specified in the if and else parts.
