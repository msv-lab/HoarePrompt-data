Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). `n` is the final value of `n` after all updates (updated to `n // 2 - 1` if it is even, or remains unchanged if it is odd). `m` is the final value of `m` after all updates (`n // 2 - 1` if `n` is even, or `n // 2` if `n` is odd). `a[m]` is increased by 1. If `a[m] > a[m + 1]`, then `a[m]` is the last incremented value, `a[m + 1]` is the value after incrementing, and all elements in `a` between indices `m` and `n-1` are in non-decreasing order. If `a[m] <= a[m + 1]`, no specific changes are mentioned, but the loop will still end with all elements in `a` between indices `m` and `n-1` being in non-decreasing order.***
