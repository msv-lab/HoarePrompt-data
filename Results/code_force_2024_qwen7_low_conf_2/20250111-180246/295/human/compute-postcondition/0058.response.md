The code appends the current value of `operations` to the list `results`. No other changes are made to the variables. Therefore, the value of `results` becomes a list containing two elements: the original value of `operations` and the updated value of `operations` (which is the same as the original value since no new operations are performed).

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `median_index` is `(n - 1) // 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `median` is equal to `a[(n - 1) // 2]`, `operations` is the sum of all differences `(median + 1 - a[i])` where `a[i] < median + 1` for all `i` in the range `(median_index, n)`, `results` is a list containing the original value of `operations` and the updated value of `operations`, `i` is `n`.**
