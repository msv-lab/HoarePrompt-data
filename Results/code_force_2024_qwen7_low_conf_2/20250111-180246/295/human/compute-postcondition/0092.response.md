The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it appears to process input through other means (such as test cases with specific constraints). However, based on the given constraints and relationships, the function processes multiple test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\), and an array `a` which is a list of `n` integers where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).

For each test case, the function returns a value based on the processed input.
