The code updates the `operations` variable by adding `median + 1 - a[i]` to its current value. Given that `i` is `median_index + 1`, and knowing that `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `i` is \((n - 1) // 2 + 1\). The value of `median` is already defined as \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\).

Let's denote:
- `median_value` as \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\)
- `a[i]` as \(a[(n - 1) // 2 + 1]\)

So, the updated value of `operations` is the original value of `operations` plus \(median + 1 - a[i]\), which is \(median_value + 1 - a[(n - 1) // 2 + 1]\).

Since the `results` list contains the value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations`, and `i` is now `median_index + 1`, the updated `results` list will contain the same values it had before plus the new value of `operations`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `median` is equal to \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is increased by \(median_value + 1 - a[(n - 1) // 2 + 1]\), and `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations`, `i` is \((n - 1) // 2 + 1**
