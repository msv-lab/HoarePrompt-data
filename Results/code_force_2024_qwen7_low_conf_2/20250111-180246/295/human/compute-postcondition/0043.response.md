The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Before sorting, `a` contains a list of integers based on the input. After sorting, the list `a` will be sorted, but none of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `median_index`, `median`, `operations`, `results`, `i`) are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 2, `n` is an integer equal to the user input, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is the sum of all increments performed by the loop, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations`, `i` is `n`**
