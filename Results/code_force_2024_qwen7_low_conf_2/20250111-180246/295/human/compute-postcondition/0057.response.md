Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a sorted list of integers based on the input, `median` is equal to \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is the sum of all differences \((median + 1 - a[i])\) where \(a[i] < median + 1\) for all \(i\) in the range \((median_index, n)\), `results` is a list containing the final value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations`, `i` is `n`.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `median_index` to `n-1` (inclusive).
- For each iteration, if `a[i] < median + 1`, `operations` is incremented by `median + 1 - a[i]`.
- The loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range \((median_index, n)\).
- After the loop completes, `operations` will hold the sum of all differences \((median + 1 - a[i])\) where `a[i] < median + 1` for all `i` in the range \((median_index, n)\).
- `results` will contain the final value of `operations` and the latest value of `operations`.
- The variable `i` will be set to `n` after the loop completes, indicating that the loop has finished its iterations.
