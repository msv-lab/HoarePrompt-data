Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `n` is an integer greater than `median_index`, `median_index` is \((n - 1) // 2\), `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `median` is \(a[(n - 1) // 2]\), `operations` is incremented by a positive integer, `results` is a list containing the value of `operations`, and `i` is initialized to `median_index`. If `a[i]` is less than `median + 1`, `a[i]` remains unchanged; otherwise, `i` is decremented by 1.***
