The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The variables `t`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged from their initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `results` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (positive), `n` and `a` are not yet defined, `results` is an empty list []**
