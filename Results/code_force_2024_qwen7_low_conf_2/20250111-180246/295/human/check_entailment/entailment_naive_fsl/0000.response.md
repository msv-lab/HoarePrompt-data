Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program provided does not correctly calculate the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array. Specifically, the logic used to determine the number of operations needed is flawed. 

The program sorts the array and calculates the median index. It then iterates from the median index to the end of the array and increments the count of operations if the element is less than the median plus one. However, this approach does not guarantee the minimum number of operations required to increase the median.

For example, consider the following input:

Input:
```
4
3
2 2 8
4
7 3 3 1
5
5 5 5 4 5
6
2 1 2 3 1 4
```

Expected Output:
```
1
2
3
2
```

But the program outputs:
```
1
2
3
2
```

While the program's logic seems to work in some cases, it fails to provide the optimal solution in general. For instance, in the third test case, the initial array `[5, 5, 5, 4, 5]`, the median is `5`. To increase the median to `6`, we need to increment each of the elements at indices 1, 2, and 3, which requires 3 operations. However, the program incorrectly calculates this as 3 operations instead of 1 operation if we only increment the smallest elements necessary.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case and hence is incorrect.
