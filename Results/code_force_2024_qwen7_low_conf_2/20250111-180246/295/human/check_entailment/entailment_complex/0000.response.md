Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases `t` and iterates through each test case. It reads the size of the array `n` and the array `a` for each test case, which matches the problem statement.

2. **Sorting and Median Calculation**: The function sorts the array `a` and calculates the median index correctly using `median_index = (n - 1) // 2`. This ensures that the median is calculated as per the problem statement, even for arrays with an odd or even number of elements.

3. **Operation Count Calculation**: The function iterates through the array from the median index to the end of the array. It counts the number of operations needed to ensure all elements from the median index to the end of the array are greater than or equal to `median + 1`. This logic is sound and directly addresses the problem requirements.

4. **Output**: The function correctly formats and prints the results for each test case. Each result is the minimum number of operations required to increase the median of the array.

Given the provided explanation and the annotated program, the function appears to correctly implement the logic to solve the problem. There are no apparent errors or edge cases that would cause the function to produce incorrect results based on the problem description and the provided example.

Correctness: **True**
