Postcondition: **`pos` remains unchanged, `per` remains unchanged, `ans` is a list containing all valid \([i, i-4, i-8]\) triplets where \(i > 8\) and \(i\) is within the range defined by `per` and \(n // 2\), `ost` is a list containing all values of \(i\) that do not meet the condition \(i > 8\). The current length of `ost` is 3.**
