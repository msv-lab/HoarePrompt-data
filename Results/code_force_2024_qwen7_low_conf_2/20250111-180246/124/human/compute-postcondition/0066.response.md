The code appends a list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is greater than 8 and satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, the values in the list will be `i`, `i - 4`, and `i - 8`.

Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we can represent the updated values as follows:

- `i` remains unchanged
- `i - 4` is the value of `i` minus 4
- `i - 8` is the value of `i` minus 8

The values of `pos` and `per` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. The initial condition that `i` is greater than 8 and satisfies the given condition also remains valid.

Output State: **`pos` must contain integers that satisfy `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `per` must be one of `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the specified conditions, and `n` must be such that `n // 2` is a valid boundary and `per` is a valid starting point; `i` is greater than 8; `ans` contains the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`.**
