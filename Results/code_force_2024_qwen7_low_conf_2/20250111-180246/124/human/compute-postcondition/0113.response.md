According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and `ans`. If `x` is an element of `ans`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `results` is a list containing the original elements plus a new string created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces.
- `x` is a list with at least one element.

For the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be the next element in `ans`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `x` is the next element in `ans` and `results` remains as it is since the loop body is omitted and no modifications to `results` are mentioned.

State: **`results` is a list containing the original elements plus a new string created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces, `x` is the next element in `ans`**
