The code `pos = i + 2` changes the value of `pos`. Initially, `i` is 11. Therefore, `pos` will be updated to 11 + 2, which is 13. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 12 and 17, `i` is 11, `ans` is `[3, 4, 5, [7, 8, 9], [11, 12, 13]]`, `pos` is 13**
