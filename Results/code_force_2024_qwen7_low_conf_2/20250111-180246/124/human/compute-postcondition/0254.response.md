Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is the last value that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `pos` is the last value of `i + 2`, `ans` contains all lists of the form `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` for each valid `i`, `ost` contains all valid `i` values that meet the condition, `per` is either `n` or `n - 3` depending on whether the condition `(n - 3) % 4 == 2` holds, and the condition `(n - 2) % 4 != 2` holds true.***
