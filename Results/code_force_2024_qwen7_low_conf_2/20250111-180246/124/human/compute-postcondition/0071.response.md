Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Conditions**:
   - `pos`: Contains integers that satisfy `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
   - `per`: Must be one of `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the specified conditions.
   - `n`: Such that `n // 2` is a valid boundary and `per` is a valid starting point.
   - `ans`: Contains the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` if `i` is greater than 8.
   - `ost`: Contains `i` otherwise.
   - `i`: Starts from `per` and decreases by 12 each iteration until it reaches `n // 2`.

2. **Determine the Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `pos` satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
   - `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`.
   - `n` is such that `n // 2` is a valid boundary and `per` is a valid starting point.
   - `ans` contains `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` if `i` is greater than 8.
   - `ost` contains `i` otherwise.
   - `i` is a value less than or equal to 8.

3. **Determine the Next State for the Loop to Execute One More Time**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be decreased by 12 from its current value.
   - The new value of `i` must still satisfy the conditions for `per` and `n`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - `pos` remains unchanged as it depends on `i` which changes.
   - `per` remains unchanged as it is determined at the start of the loop.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is determined at the start of the loop.
   - `ans` should be updated to the list `[i - 12, (i - 12) - 4, (i - 12) - 8]` if `i - 12` is greater than 8.
   - `ost` should be updated to `i - 12`.
   - `i` is decreased by 12 from its current value.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: **`pos` satisfies the condition `(i - 12) % 2 != 0 or (i - 12) % 4 == 0) and (i - 12) > n // 2`, `per` must be one of `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3`, `n` must be such that `n // 2` is a valid boundary and `per` is a valid starting point, `ans` contains `[i - 12, (i - 12) - 4, (i - 12) - 8]` if `i - 12` is greater than 8, otherwise `ost` contains `i - 12`, and `i` is decreased by 12 from its current value.**
