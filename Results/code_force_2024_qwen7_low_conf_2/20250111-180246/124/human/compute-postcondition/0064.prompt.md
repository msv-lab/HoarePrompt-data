You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an if statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account the condition of the if statement. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after entering the if condition. So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is also true. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is less than 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` is integer of any value`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive less than 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m, a is alist of integers
if condition:
```
if n < 0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`,  if m is higher than 10 n equals minus m. a is a list of integers. the current value of  n is lower than 0***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is not 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given for loop:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The for loop iterates over the range from `per` to `n // 2` in steps of `-12`. For the loop to execute, the following conditions must hold:
   - The starting value of `i` (which is `per`) must be greater than `n // 2` (inclusive).
   - The loop should continue as long as `i` is greater than `n // 2` but less than `n // 2` minus the total number of steps (which is a multiple of 12).

2. **Condition on `per`**: 
   - Since the loop starts from `per` and goes down to `n // 2` in steps of `-12`, `per` must be greater than `n // 2` to ensure the loop runs.

3. **Condition on `n`**:
   - The loop step is `-12`, so the total number of iterations is determined by the difference between `per` and `n // 2`, divided by 12. This implies that `per` must be within a range that allows for a positive number of iterations.
   - Additionally, `n` must be such that `n // 2` is a valid boundary for the loop, and `per` must be a valid starting point for these conditions.

4. **Conditions on `pos` and `per`**:
   - `pos` is a list that contains integers `i` in the specified range. This means `pos` must contain values that fit the criteria `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
   - `per` is defined based on the conditions involving `n - 1`, `n - 2`, and `n - 3`. Therefore, `per` must be one of `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the modulus conditions.

### Required Adjustments:

- **`pos`**: Ensure that `pos` contains valid integers based on the specified criteria.
- **`per`**: Ensure that `per` is correctly set according to the conditions mentioned.
- **`n`**: Ensure that `n` is such that the loop can start from `per` and decrement to `n // 2` in steps of `-12`.

### Final State:

- `pos` must contain integers that satisfy `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
- `per` must be one of `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the specified conditions.
- `n` must be such that `n // 2` is a valid boundary and `per` is a valid starting point.

Therefore, the required state is:

**State: `pos` must contain integers that satisfy `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `per` must be one of `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the specified conditions, and `n` must be such that `n // 2` is a valid boundary and `per` is a valid starting point.**
if condition:
```
if (i > n // 2):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition . All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the if condition must also be included. If the variables have values related to previous conditions try to put that early in the postcondition and say the current value of the variable from then on. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it enters the if condition.
