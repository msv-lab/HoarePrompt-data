The code appends a new string to the list `results`. This string is created by joining the elements of the list `x` as strings with a space delimiter. Since the initial value of `results` is already a list containing the string `' '.join(map(str, x))`, appending another string to it means that `results` now contains two elements: the initial string and the newly created string from `x`.

The other variables (`ans`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `data[index-1]`, and `t`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string `' '.join(map(str, x))` and another string created by `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `ans` is a non-empty list, `ans1` is a list containing valid elements, `ans2` is a list containing valid elements, `data[index-1]` is an existing and integer value, and `t` is greater than 0.**
