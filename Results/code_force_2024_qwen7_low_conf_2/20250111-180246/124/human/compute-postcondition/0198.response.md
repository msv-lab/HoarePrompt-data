According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x` and the list `ans`. The loop iterates over each element in `ans`. At the end of the last iteration, `results` is a list that includes the string created by `' '.join(map(str, x))`, and `x` is unchanged.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:

1. **Check the current value of `x`:** Since `x` is unchanged, it remains the same as it was in the last iteration.
2. **Determine if the loop can continue:** The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `ans`.

Given that `x` is unchanged and `results` now includes the string created by `' '.join(map(str, x))`, we can conclude that `ans` still contains at least one element. Therefore, the loop can execute again.

State: **`results` is a list that includes the string created by `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `x` is unchanged, `ans` must have at least one element remaining**
