The code appends a new list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 11. Therefore, the new list appended to `ans` will be `[11, 12, 13]`.

- `n` remains an integer between 12 and 17 (inclusive).
- `i` is updated to 11.
- `ans` is updated to include the new list `[11, 12, 13]`.
- `pos` remains 9.

Thus, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 12 and 17, `i` is 11, `ans` is `[3, 4, 5, [7, 8, 9], [11, 12, 13]]`, `pos` is 9**.
