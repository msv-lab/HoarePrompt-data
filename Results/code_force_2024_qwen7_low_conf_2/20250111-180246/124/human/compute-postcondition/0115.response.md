Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Understand the Initial State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a list containing the original elements plus a new string created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces.
   - The variable `x` is part of the `ans` list.

2. **Determine the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over each element in `ans`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are elements left in `ans`.

3. **Identify the Variables Involved:**
   - `results`: A list that will be updated during the loop.
   - `x`: An element from the `ans` list being processed in the current iteration.
   - `ans`: The list from which `x` is taken.

4. **Update the State for the Next Iteration:**
   - After processing an element `x` from `ans`, the next element in `ans` will be taken for the next iteration.
   - Therefore, `x` will be set to the next element in `ans`.
   - `results` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration since no modifications are mentioned in the loop body for this specific case.

5. **State Adjustment:**
   - `x` will be the next element in `ans`.
   - `results` will remain unchanged.

Given these steps, we can formulate the state for the next iteration:

**State: **`results` is a list containing the original elements plus a new string created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces, `x` is the next element in `ans`**.
