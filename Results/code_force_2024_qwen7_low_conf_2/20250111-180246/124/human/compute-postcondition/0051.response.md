The variable `per` is assigned the value of `n`. The value of `n` is not altered, and the list `pos` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `pos` is an integer list that contains all integers `i` in the range `[pos[-1] + 1, n]` such that `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. If no such `i` exists, `pos` remains unchanged; `per` is `n`.

Output State: **`pos` is an integer list that contains all integers `i` in the range `[pos[-1] + 1, n]` such that `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. If no such `i` exists, `pos` remains unchanged; `per` is `n`.**
