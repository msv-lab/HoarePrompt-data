The code `results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` impacts the `results` list by appending a new element. This new element is a string created by joining the elements of `x` (which are converted to strings using `map(str, x)`) with a space (' ') as the separator.

Given the initial state:
- `ost` is a string
- `ans` must have at least one element
- `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is at least 1 and the second element is the joined string of the next `x` in `ans`

After executing the code:
- The first element of `results` remains unchanged, which is at least 1.
- The second element of `results` is updated to be the string formed by joining the elements of `x` (converted to strings) with a space.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`ost` is a string, `ans` must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing the first element as at least 1, and the second element as the joined string of the elements in `x` (converted to strings) separated by a space.**
