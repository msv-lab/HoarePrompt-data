`ans.append([i, i - 4, i - 8])` appends a list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` to the list `ans`. Given that `i` is an integer greater than `n / 2` and currently greater than 8, the values in the list will be:

- The first element is `i`.
- The second element is `i - 4`.
- The third element is `i - 8`.

Since `i` is greater than `n / 2` and greater than 8, the smallest possible value for `i` would be 9 (assuming `n` is 10 or more). Therefore, the values will be:

- First element: `i` (which is greater than 8).
- Second element: `i - 4` (which is greater than 5).
- Third element: `i - 8` (which is greater than -1).

The initial values of `i` and `n` remain unchanged, and the new list is added to `ans`. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than `n / 2` and greater than 8; `n` is an integer; `ans` is a list containing [[i, i - 4, i - 8]] where i > 8.**
