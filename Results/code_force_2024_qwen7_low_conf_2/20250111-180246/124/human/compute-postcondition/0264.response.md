Postcondition: **`i` is an integer. If `i` is greater than `n / 2` and also greater than 8, `ans` contains the list `[[i, i - 4, i - 8]]`. If `i` is greater than `n / 2` but less than or equal to 8, `ans` contains the list `[i]`. If `i` is not greater than `n / 2`, `ans` is not modified and remains as its original value.**
