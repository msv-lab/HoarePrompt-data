The variable `index` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 3 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 30000, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is `1`**
