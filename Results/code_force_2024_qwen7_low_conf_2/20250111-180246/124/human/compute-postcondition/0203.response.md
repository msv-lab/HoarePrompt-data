According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a list containing the string representation of each triplet in `ans` formatted as `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `x` is unchanged, and `ans` must be empty.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the number of iterations for the loop and it must be decremented or initialized in the loop body, we need to adjust `t` accordingly.

State: **`results` is a list that contains the string representation of each triplet in `ans` formatted as `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `x` is unchanged, `ans` must be empty, `t` must be greater than 0**
