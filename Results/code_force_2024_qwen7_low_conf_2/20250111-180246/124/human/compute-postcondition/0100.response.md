`results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a string representation of the list `x` (with elements converted to strings) joined by spaces to the `results` list. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `per`, `pos`, or the content of `ans`. Since the code only modifies the `results` list and does not affect `per`, `pos`, or `ans`, we need to keep these unchanged in the output state.

Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one valid triplet, `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged, `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x` joined by spaces**
