Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2` and equals `i + 4`, `ans` is `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6, i, i + 1, i + 2]`, and `pos` is `i + 6`. If `i > n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` includes additional elements `i` and `i + 1, i + 2`. Otherwise, `ans` remains as `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]`.***
