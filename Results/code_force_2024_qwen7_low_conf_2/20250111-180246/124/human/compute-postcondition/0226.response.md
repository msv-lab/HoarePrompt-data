The initial state provides that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2` and equals `i + 4`, `ans` is `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]`, and `pos` is `i + 6`. 

The code snippet is:
```python
ans.append([i, i + 1, i + 2])
```

- `i` is initially `i + 4`, meaning `i` is set to itself plus 4, so `i` is an integer that satisfies `i > n // 2 - 2`.
- `ans` is initially `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]`.
- The code appends `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to `ans`.

So, after the append operation, `ans` becomes:
```python
ans = [i + 4, i + 5, i + 6, i, i + 1, i + 2]
```

The values of `n`, `pos`, and the relationship between `i` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2` and equals `i + 4`, `ans` is `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6, i, i + 1, i + 2]`, and `pos` is `i + 6`**
