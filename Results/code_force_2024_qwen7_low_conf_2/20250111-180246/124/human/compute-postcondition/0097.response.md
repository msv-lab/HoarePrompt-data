Postcondition: ***`ans` is a list containing all valid `[i, i-4, i-8]` triplets where `i > 8` and `i` is within the range defined by `per` and `n // 2`. If `len(ost) == 1`, `ans` includes the additional element `[1, 2, ost[0]]`. If `len(ost) == 2`, `ans` includes the additional element `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]`. If `len(ost) == 3`, `ost` becomes an empty list. If `len(ost) == 4`, `ans` includes the additional element `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`. `per` and `pos` remain unchanged, and `ost` is a list containing values that do not meet the condition `i > 8`.***
