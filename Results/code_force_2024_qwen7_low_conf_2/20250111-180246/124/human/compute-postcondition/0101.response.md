According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. The loop continues as long as `ans` contains at least one valid triplet.

At the end of the last iteration, `ans` must contain at least one valid triplet, `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged, and `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x` joined by spaces.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still contain at least one valid triplet. Since the loop body processes each element of `ans` sequentially, `per` and `pos` will remain unchanged, and `results` will gain another string representation of `x` joined by spaces.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `ans` must still contain at least one valid triplet.
- `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged.
- `results` will contain an additional element which is a string representation of `x` joined by spaces.

State: **`ans` must contain at least one valid triplet, `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged, `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x` joined by spaces**
