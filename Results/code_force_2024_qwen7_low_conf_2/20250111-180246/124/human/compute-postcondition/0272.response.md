The code `ost.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. The value of `i` is `i_{\text{prev}} - 24`. Since the value of `i` is directly derived from `i_{\text{prev}} - 24`, the list `ost` will contain this value. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`i` is `i_{\text{prev}} - 24`, `ost` contains `[i_{\text{prev}} - 24]`**
