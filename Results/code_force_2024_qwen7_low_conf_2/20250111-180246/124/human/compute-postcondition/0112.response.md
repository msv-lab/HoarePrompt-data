The code appends a string to the `results` list. The string is created by joining the elements of the list `x` using a space as the separator, and then converting each element to a string.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `results` and `x`, we can only say that `results` is a list and `x` is a list with at least one element, as per the precondition. After the code runs, `results` will contain the original elements plus the new string created from `x`.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the original elements plus a new string created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces, `x` is a list with at least one element**
