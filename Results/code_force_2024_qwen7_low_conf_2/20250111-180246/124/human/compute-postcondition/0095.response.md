Postcondition: **`pos` remains unchanged, `per` remains unchanged, `ans` is a list containing all valid \([i, i-4, i-8]\) triplets where \(i > 8\) and \(i\) is within the range defined by `per` and \(n // 2\). If `len(ost) == 3`, `ost` is an empty list. Otherwise, `ost` is a list containing all values of \(i\) that do not meet the condition \(i > 8\) and currently has 4 elements, and `ans` includes an additional triplet `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`.**
