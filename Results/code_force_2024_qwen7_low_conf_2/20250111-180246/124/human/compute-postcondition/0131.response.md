Postcondition: ***`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` is 11, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5, [9, 10, 11]]`, `ost` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 9. If `i` > `n` // 2 - 2, `pos` is set to 11, `ans` includes the triplet `[9, 10, 11]`. Otherwise, the condition does not change any additional variables.***
