The variable `pos` is assigned the value `i + 2`. The initial value of `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, so `pos` will be set to a value that is exactly `i + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2`, `ans` is `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`, `pos` is `i + 2`**
