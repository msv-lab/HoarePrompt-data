To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given information and the requirements for the loop:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for values of `i` starting from 3 up to `n-1`, incrementing by 4 each time (`range(3, n - 1, 4)`).
2. **Initial State**: 
   - `results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines.
   - `per` remains unchanged.
   - `pos` is 0.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `index` remains unchanged.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` is an empty list.
   - `ost` is an empty list.

For the loop to execute, the initial value of `i` (which is 3) must be within the bounds specified by `range(3, n - 1, 4)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization of `i`**: The loop starts with `i = 3`.
2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: For the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n - 1`. The loop increments `i` by 4 each time until `i` reaches or exceeds `n - 1`.

### Necessary Adjustments:
- **`n` must be greater than 3**: This ensures that the loop can start with `i = 3` and continue as long as `i < n - 1`.
- **`i` is set to 3**: This is the initial value of `i` for the loop to start.

### Final State:
The states that need to be adjusted to ensure the loop can execute are:
- `n` must be greater than 3.
- `i` is set to 3.

Thus, the final answer is:
**State: `results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` is an empty list, `ost` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 3**
