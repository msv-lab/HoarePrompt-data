The code appends the first three elements of the `ost` list to `ans` as a new sublist. Since `ost` has a length of 3, `ost[0]`, `ost[1]`, and `ost[2]` are appended to `ans`. The values of `ost` and `ans` are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`pos` remains unchanged, `per` remains unchanged, `ans` is a list containing all valid \([i, i-4, i-8]\) triplets where \(i > 8\) and \(i\) is within the range defined by `per` and \(n // 2\), plus an additional sublist \([ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]\), `ost` is a list containing all values of \(i\) that do not meet the condition \(i > 8\) and now has a length of 0.**
