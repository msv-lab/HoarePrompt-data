`results` is appended with the string representation of `x` joined by spaces. This means that `results` now contains its original elements plus this new string. The variables `ans`, `per`, and `pos` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `ans` must contain at least one valid triplet, `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged, `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x` joined by spaces.

Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one valid triplet, `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged, `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x` joined by spaces**
