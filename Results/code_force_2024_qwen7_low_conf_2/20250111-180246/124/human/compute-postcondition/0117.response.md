Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each list in `ans` joined by newlines, `x` is the last element in `ans`, `ans` is the final list of triplets after all iterations, and `index` is the last incremented value of `index`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each element `x` in `ans`.
- During each iteration, the string representation of the list `x` is appended to `results`.
- After the loop completes, `results` will contain the string representation of each list in `ans`, joined by newlines.
- Since the loop processes all elements in `ans`, `x` will be the last element in `ans`.
- `index` is incremented by 1 in each iteration and will be the last incremented value after the loop completes.
- `ans` remains unchanged during the loop and contains the final list of triplets.
- `per` and `pos` remain unchanged throughout the loop execution.
