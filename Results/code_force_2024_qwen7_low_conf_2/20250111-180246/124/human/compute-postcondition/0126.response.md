`pos` is assigned the value of `i + 2`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 4, the new value of `pos` is 6. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` is 6, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5]`, `ost` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 6 (since the code increments `i` after appending the list).

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` is 6, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5]`, `ost` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 6**
