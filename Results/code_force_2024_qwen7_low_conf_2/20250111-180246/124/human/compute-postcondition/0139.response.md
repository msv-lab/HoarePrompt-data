The code `ost.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. Given the conditions, the value of `i` currently satisfies `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)`, and it is also greater than or equal to `n + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the updated state includes `ost` now containing the value of `i`, while the other variables retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` must be greater than or equal to `n + 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` contains all valid triplets generated up to `n-1`, `ost` is a list containing the value of `i`, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` must be greater than or equal to `n + 2`, and the current value of `i` satisfies the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)`**
