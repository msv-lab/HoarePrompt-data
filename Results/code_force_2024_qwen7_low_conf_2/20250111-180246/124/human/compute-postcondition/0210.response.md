According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. The loop will continue as long as `ans` contains at least one element. At the end of the previous iteration, `results` is a list containing the string `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `ans` is a non-empty list, `ans1` is a list containing valid elements, `ans2` is a list containing valid elements, `data[index-1]` is an existing and integer value, and `t` is greater than 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, `ans` must still contain at least one element. Since `ans` was non-empty at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure it remains non-empty for the next iteration.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `ans` still contains at least one element.

State: **`results` is a list containing the string `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `ans` is a non-empty list, `ans1` is a list containing valid elements, `ans2` is a list containing valid elements, `data[index-1]` is an existing and integer value, and `t` is greater than 0**
