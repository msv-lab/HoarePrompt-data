The code `t = int(data[index])` assigns the integer value of `data[index]` to the variable `t`. Given the initial state, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting an input string, and `index` is `0`. Therefore, `data[index]` is the first element of the list `data`, which is a string representing an integer between 1 and 100.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `data`, `ans1`, `ans2`, and `index`) remain unchanged. Thus, the updated state is:

- `t` is assigned the integer value of the first element of `data`.
- `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 30000.
- `data` remains a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
- `ans1` is `[8]`.
- `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`.
- `index` is `0`.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 30000, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is `0`**
