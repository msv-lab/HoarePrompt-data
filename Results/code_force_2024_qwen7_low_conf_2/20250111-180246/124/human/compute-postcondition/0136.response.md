Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` is `n + 1`, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` contains all valid triplets generated up to `n-1`, `ost` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is `n - 1` if the loop completes.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `results`: Initially an empty list that will store the string representations of triplets.
   - `pos`: Initially 0, it is updated to `i + 2` inside the loop.
   - `t`: Must be greater than 0.
   - `index`: Remains unchanged.
   - `data`: Remains unchanged.
   - `ans`: Initially an empty list, it will store valid triplets.
   - `ost`: Initially an empty list, remains unchanged.
   - `n`: Greater than 3.
   - `i`: Starts from 3 and increments by 4 each time.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs in increments of 4 starting from 3 up to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, if `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, the triplet `[i, i+1, i+2]` is appended to `ans` and `pos` is set to `i + 2`.

3. **Final Values:**
   - After the loop finishes, `i` will be `n - 1` because the loop increments by 4 starting from 3 and stops just before `n - 1`.
   - `pos` will be `n + 1` because `pos` is set to `i + 2` where `i` is `n - 1`.
   - `ans` will contain all valid triplets generated during the loop, which means it will include `[3, 4, 5]`, `[7, 8, 9]`, `[11, 12, 13]`, and so on, up to `[n-1, n, n+1]` if `n` is within the valid range.
   - `results` will contain the string representations of these triplets joined by newlines.
   - All other variables (`per`, `t`, `index`, `data`, `ost`) remain unchanged.

4. **Loop Termination Condition:**
   - The loop terminates when `i` is no longer greater than `n // 2 - 2`, which happens when `i` reaches `n - 1` if `n` is within the valid range.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the output state is as described above.
