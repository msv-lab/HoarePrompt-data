Postcondition: ***`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains the same, `pos` remains unchanged, `t` remains greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` now contains all valid triplets, including possibly `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` or `[9, 5, 1]`, `ost` now contains all values of `i` that satisfy the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)` (updated with the new value `i - 12` if applicable), `n` remains the same, and `i` is adjusted to `i - 12` if it still satisfies the condition `i > n // 2`***
