Postcondition: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` is set to a value that is at least `n // 2`, `pos` remains unchanged, `t` must remain greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` now contains all valid triplets, including possibly `[9, 5, 1]`, `ost` now contains all values of `i` that satisfy the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)` plus the new value `i + 12`, `n` remains the same, and `i` is `i - 12` if it still satisfies the condition `i > n // 2`.**
