The code appends a string to the `results` list. However, the initial state does not include `results`. Therefore, `results` is a new list created and the first element appended to it is the result of `' '.join(map(str, x))`.

Since `x` is not defined in the initial state, let's assume `x` is a list (as per typical usage). The value of `x` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact content of the string that will be appended. However, we know that each element of `x` will be converted to a string and joined with a space.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is a non-empty list
- `ans1` is a list containing valid elements
- `ans2` is a list containing valid elements
- `data[index-1]` is an existing and integer value
- `t` is greater than 0

The only change is the creation of `results` and appending a string to it. Thus, the updated state is:

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string ' '.join(map(str, x)); `ans` is a non-empty list; `ans1` is a list containing valid elements; `ans2` is a list containing valid elements; `data[index-1]` is an existing and integer value; `t` is greater than 0**
