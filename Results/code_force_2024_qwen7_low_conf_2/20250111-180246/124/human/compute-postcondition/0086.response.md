The code appends a list `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]` to the list `ans`. Since `ost` initially contains exactly 2 elements, `ost[0]` and `ost[1]` represent the first and second elements of `ost` respectively. After appending this list to `ans`, the value of `ans` changes. The other variables (`pos`, `per`, `ost`) remain unchanged.

Here's the detailed step-by-step calculation:

1. `ans` is a list containing all valid `[i, i-4, i-8]` triplets where `i > 8` and `i` is within the range defined by `per` and `n // 2`.
2. `ost` is a list containing all values of `i` that do not meet the condition `i > 8`, and currently has exactly 2 elements.
3. The code appends `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]` to `ans`.

Since the exact values of `ost[0]` and `ost[1]` are not given, they are represented as `ost[0]` and `ost[1]` respectively.

Output State: **`pos` remains unchanged, `per` remains unchanged, `ans` now includes the additional element `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]`, `ost` remains unchanged with exactly 2 elements.**
