The code appends a string to the `results` list. The string is created by joining the elements of the list `x` converted to strings with a space as the separator. Since the initial state only mentions that `ans` must have at least one element, and there is no direct mention of `x` or `results`, we need to assume that `x` is a list (since it's used in `map` and `join` operations) and `results` is a list where the new string will be appended.

Given this, the output state will be:

- `results` is a list that now includes the new string created by the operation `' '.join(map(str, x))`.
- `x` remains unchanged.

Since the exact values of `x` are not provided, we can represent the updated `results` list as containing the newly formed string.

Output State: **`results` is a list that now includes the string created by `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `x` is unchanged**
