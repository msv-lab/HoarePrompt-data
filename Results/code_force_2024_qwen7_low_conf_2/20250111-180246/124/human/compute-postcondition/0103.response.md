According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. For the loop to execute again, `ans` must contain at least one valid triplet. At the end of the last iteration, `ans` must contain at least one valid triplet, `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged, and `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of `x` joined by spaces.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the following:

1. `ans` must still contain at least one valid triplet.
2. `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged.
3. `results` should now contain the string representation of the next `x` joined by spaces.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`ans` must contain at least one valid triplet, `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged, `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of the next `x` joined by spaces**
