The value of `i` is 3, so `pos` is assigned the value of `i + 2`, which is `3 + 2 = 5`. The value of `n` remains greater than 4, and the list `ans` is unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 3, `ans` is `[3, 4, 5]`, and `pos` is 5.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 3, `ans` is `[3, 4, 5]`, and `pos` is 5**
