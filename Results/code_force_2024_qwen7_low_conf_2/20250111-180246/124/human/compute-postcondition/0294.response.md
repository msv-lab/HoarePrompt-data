`results` is a list, and the code appends a new element to it. The new element is created by joining the elements of `x` (which must be a list of strings) with spaces. Since the initial state of `results` is a list containing a single element which is at least 1, and assuming `x` is a list of integers or strings, the `map(str, x)` converts each element of `x` to a string, and `' '.join(map(str, x))` joins these strings with a space.

Given the initial state, let's assume `x` is a list containing at least one element. For example, if `x = [1, 2, 3]`, then `' '.join(map(str, x))` would result in the string `"1 2 3"`.

Since the exact value of `x` is not specified, we can represent the new element in `results` as the joined string of `x`.

Output State: **`ost` is a string, `ans` must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing two elements where the first element is at least 1 and the second element is the joined string of `x`.**
