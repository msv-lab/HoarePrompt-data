The code `ost.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `ost`. Given the initial state, `i` is the largest integer such that `i <= n // 2 - 2` and satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. After appending `i` to `ost`, the value of `i` does not change, and the list `ost` now includes the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is the largest integer such that `i <= n // 2 - 2` and satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `ans` contains all lists of the form `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` for each valid `i`, and `pos` is the last value of `i + 2` and must satisfy `pos + 1 <= n + 1`; `ost` is a list containing the value of `i`.**
