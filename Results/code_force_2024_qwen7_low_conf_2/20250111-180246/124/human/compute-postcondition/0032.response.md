`ans.append([i, i + 1, i + 2])` appends a new list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to the existing list `ans`. Given the initial state where `i` is 7, the new list added to `ans` will be `[7, 8, 9]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `pos` remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated `ans` is `[3, 4, 5, [7, 8, 9]]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4 and less than 18, `i` is 7, `ans` is `[3, 4, 5, [7, 8, 9]]`, and `pos` is 5.**
