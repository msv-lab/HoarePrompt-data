Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines.
   - `per` remains unchanged.
   - `pos` is 11.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `index` remains unchanged.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5, [9, 10, 11]]`.
   - `ost` is an empty list.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` is 9.

2. **For Loop Condition:**
   The loop runs as follows:
   ```
   for i in range(3, n - 1, 4):
   ```

3. **Current Values:**
   - The loop condition checks if `i` is within the range defined by `range(3, n - 1, 4)`.
   - Given `i` is currently 9, we need to determine if the next value of `i` (i.e., `i + 4 = 13`) is within the range.

4. **Range Analysis:**
   - The range starts from 3 and increments by 4 until it is less than `n - 1`.
   - Therefore, the sequence of `i` values would be: 3, 7, 11, 15, ...
   - Since `i` is currently 9, the next value is 13.
   - For the loop to continue, `13 < n - 1`.

5. **Additional Conditions:**
   - The condition `i > n // 2 - 2` is checked.
   - If this condition is true, then `pos` is set to 11 and `ans` includes the triplet `[9, 10, 11]`.
   - Since `i` is currently 9, we need to check if `9 > n // 2 - 2` holds true for the loop to proceed.
   - This means `n // 2 - 2 < 9` or `n // 2 < 11` or `n < 22`.

6. **Adjusting States:**
   - If the next value of `i` (13) is within the range `3 < n - 1` and the condition `9 > n // 2 - 2` is true, then the loop continues.
   - Otherwise, the loop stops.

Based on these steps, the required states for the next iteration of the loop are:

- `results` remains the same.
- `per` remains unchanged.
- `pos` is set to 11 if `9 > n // 2 - 2` and `n < 22`.
- `ans` includes the triplet `[9, 10, 11]` if `9 > n // 2 - 2` and `n < 22`.
- `i` is set to 13.
- `n` must still be greater than 3.
- `t` remains greater than 0.
- `index` remains unchanged.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `ost` remains an empty list.

**State:**
- `results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines.
- `per` remains unchanged.
- `pos` is 11 if `9 > n // 2 - 2` and `n < 22`.
- `ans` includes the triplet `[9, 10, 11]` if `9 > n // 2 - 2` and `n < 22`.
- `i` is 13.
- `n` must be greater than 3 and less than 22.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `index` remains unchanged.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `ost` is an empty list.

State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` is 11 if `9 > n // 2 - 2` and `n < 22`, `ans` includes the triplet `[9, 10, 11]` if `9 > n // 2 - 2` and `n < 22`, `i` is 13, `n` must be greater than 3 and less than 22, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ost` is an empty list**.
