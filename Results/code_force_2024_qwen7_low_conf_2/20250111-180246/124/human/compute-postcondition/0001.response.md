`data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variables `t` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `data` and the unchanged values of `t` and `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^2, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^4, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.**
