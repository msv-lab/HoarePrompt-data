According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `ans`. The loop will execute if `ans` has at least one element. Let's break down the states:

1. **`ost`**: The value of `ost` does not directly affect the execution of the loop. The loop will execute as long as `ans` has elements.
2. **`ans`**: For the loop to execute, `ans` must have at least one element.
3. **`results`**: This list contains a single element, which is the length of `ans`. Since we need `ans` to have at least one element for the loop to execute, `results[0]` (the length of `ans`) will be at least 1.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `ans` must have at least one element.
- `results[0]` must be at least 1 (since it is the length of `ans`).

State: **`ost` is a string, `ans` must have at least one element, `results` is a list containing a single element which is at least 1**
