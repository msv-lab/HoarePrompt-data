The code `ans.append([ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]])` appends a list containing the first three characters of `ost` to the list `ans`. Since `ost` is a string with a length equal to 3, `ost[0]`, `ost[1]`, and `ost[2]` are the three characters of `ost`.

- `ost` remains unchanged as the operation only affects `ans`.
- `ans` gains a new element which is a list containing the three characters of `ost`.

Output State: **`ost` is a string with a length equal to 3; `ans` contains a list `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]`**
