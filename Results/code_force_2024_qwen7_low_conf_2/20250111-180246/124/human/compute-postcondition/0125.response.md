The code `ans.append([i, i + 1, i + 2])` appends a list containing the values `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, the value of `i` is 3, so the list appended will be `[3, 4, 5]`.

The output state after executing the code will be:

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5]`, `ost` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 4 (since the code increments `i` after appending the list)**.
