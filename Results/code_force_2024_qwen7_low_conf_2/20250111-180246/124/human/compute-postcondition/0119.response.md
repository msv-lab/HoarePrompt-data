Postcondition: ***`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines. `per` and `pos` remain unchanged. `t` must be greater than 0. If `n` is in `ans1`, then `index` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, and the final state of `ans` is as described in the if part. If `n` is not in `ans1`, the state remains unchanged as specified in the else part.***
