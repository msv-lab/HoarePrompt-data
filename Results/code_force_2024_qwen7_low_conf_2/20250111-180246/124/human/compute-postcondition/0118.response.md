The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables when using `continue`, the values of the variables remain unchanged from their previous states. 

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each list in `ans` joined by newlines, `x` is the last element in `ans`, `ans` is the final list of triplets after all iterations, and `index` is the last incremented value of `index`.**
