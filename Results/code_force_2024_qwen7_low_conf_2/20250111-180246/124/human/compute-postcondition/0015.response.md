The code `results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a new element to the list `results`. Here, `x` is not defined in the given initial state, but since `x` is part of the `ans` which is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]` at index `data[2]`, we can infer that `x` is one of the sublists within `ans`.

Given `data[2]` corresponds to the third element in the list `ans`, which is `[2, 6, 8]` or `[3, 5, 7]`, let's consider both possibilities:

1. If `x` is `[2, 6, 8]`, then `' '.join(map(str, [2, 6, 8]))` results in `"2 6 8"`.
2. If `x` is `[3, 5, 7]`, then `' '.join(map(str, [3, 5, 7]))` results in `"3 5 7"`.

Since `data[2]` is not specified to be exactly which sublist, we consider the general case where `x` could be either `[2, 6, 8]` or `[3, 5, 7]`.

Therefore, `results` will have its last element updated to `"2 6 8"` or `"3 5 7"` depending on the value of `data[2]`.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable here, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `n` is an integer derived from `data[2]`, `ans1` is [8], `ans2` is [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]], `index` is 2, `results` is ['1', '2 6 8'] or ['1', '3 5 7'], `ans` is [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]**
