The code `pos = i + 2` updates the value of `pos` by adding 2 to the current value of `i`. Given that `i` is initially 9, the new value of `pos` will be 11. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` is 11, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5, [9, 10, 11]]`, `ost` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 9**
