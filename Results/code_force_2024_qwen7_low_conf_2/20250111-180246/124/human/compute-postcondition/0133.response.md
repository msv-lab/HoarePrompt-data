The code `ans.append([i, i + 1, i + 2])` appends a new triplet to the list `ans`. Given the initial state, `i` is 13, so the triplet `[13, 14, 15]` is appended to `ans`.

Let's summarize the changes and the current state:

- `ans` initially included the triplet `[9, 10, 11]` (if `9 > n // 2 - 2` and `n < 22`), and now it also includes `[13, 14, 15]`.
- All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines; `per` remains unchanged; `pos` is 11 if `9 > n // 2 - 2` and `n < 22`; `ans` includes triplets `[9, 10, 11]` and `[13, 14, 15]`; `i` is 13; `n` must be greater than 3 and less than 22; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` remains unchanged; `data` remains unchanged; `ost` is an empty list.**
