Postcondition: **`pos` is an integer list that contains all integers `i` in the range `[pos[-1] + 1, n]` such that `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. If no such `i` exists, `pos` remains unchanged; `per` is `n`. The condition `(n - 1) % 4 != 2` holds true. The current value of `(n - 2) % 4` is 2.**
