`ans` is assigned the value of `ans2[ans1.index(n)]`. Here, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`. Since `index` is increased by 1, `n` is now the integer value of `data[index-1]`. The value of `ans` is updated based on this index, while other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`index` is increased by 2, `results` is a list that contains the string representation of each triplet in `ans` formatted as `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `ans` is updated based on `ans2[ans1.index(data[index-1])]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`.**
