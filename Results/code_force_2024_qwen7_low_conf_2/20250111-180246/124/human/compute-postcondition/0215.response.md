The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and move to the next iteration. Since no changes are made to the variables within the `continue` statement, the values of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`, `ans` is a non-empty list, `ans1` is a list containing valid elements, `ans2` is a list containing valid elements, `data[index-1]` is an existing and integer value, `t` is greater than 0, and `x` is the last element in `ans`.**
