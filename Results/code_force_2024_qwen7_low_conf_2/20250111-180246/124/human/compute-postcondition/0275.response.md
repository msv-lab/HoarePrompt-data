Let's analyze the loop and its behavior step by step based on the provided initial conditions and the given output states after a few iterations.

### Initial Conditions:
- \( n \) is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
- \( i \) is the last value that satisfies the condition \( (i \% 2 \neq 0 \text{ or } i \% 4 == 0) \text{ and } i > n // 2 \).
- \( pos \) is the last value of \( i + 2 \).
- \( ans \) contains all lists of the form \([i, i + 1, i + 2]\) for each valid \( i \).
- \( ost \) contains all valid \( i \) values that meet the condition.
- \( per \) is equal to either \( n - 1 \), \( n - 2 \), \( n - 3 \), or \( n \) depending on the value of \( n \mod 4 \).

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(per, n // 2, -12):
    if i > n // 2:
        if i > 8:
            ans.append([i, i - 4, i - 8])
        else:
            ost.append(i)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Determine the loop's termination condition:**
   - The loop runs in steps of -12, starting from \( \text{per} \) down to \( n // 2 \).
   - The loop continues as long as \( i > n // 2 \).

2. **Behavior within the loop:**
   - If \( i > 8 \), the loop appends the list \([i, i - 4, i - 8]\) to `ans`.
   - If \( i \leq 8 \), the loop appends \( i \) to `ost`.

3. **Final values after the loop:**
   - The loop will continue until \( i \leq n // 2 \). At this point, no further values will be appended to `ans` or `ost`.
   - Therefore, the final value of `i` will be the smallest value greater than or equal to \( n // 2 \) and less than or equal to 8 (if applicable).

### Final Output State:
- **\( i \):** The final value of \( i \) will be the smallest value greater than or equal to \( n // 2 \) and less than or equal to 8 (if applicable). If no such value exists, \( i \) will be the smallest value greater than \( n // 2 \) that meets the initial condition.
- **\( ans \):** Contains all lists \([i, i - 4, i - 8]\) where \( i \) is greater than 8 and satisfied the initial condition.
- **\( ost \):** Contains all valid \( i \) values that meet the initial condition and are less than or equal to 8.

### Output State:
**Output State:**
- \( i \) is the smallest value greater than or equal to \( n // 2 \) and less than or equal to 8 (if applicable). If no such value exists, \( i \) is the smallest value greater than \( n // 2 \) that meets the initial condition.
- \( ans \) contains all lists \([i, i - 4, i - 8]\) where \( i \) is greater than 8 and satisfied the initial condition.
- \( ost \) contains all valid \( i \) values that meet the initial condition and are less than or equal to 8.
- \( n \) is the original value of \( n \).
- \( per \) is the original value of \( per \).

**Output State:** **`i` is the smallest value greater than or equal to `n // 2` and less than or equal to 8 (if applicable). If no such value exists, `i` is the smallest value greater than `n // 2` that meets the initial condition. `ans` contains all lists `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` where `i` is greater than 8 and satisfied the initial condition. `ost` contains all valid `i` values that meet the initial condition and are less than or equal to 8. `n` is the original value of `n`. `per` is the original value of `per`.**
