The given Python code snippet `ans.append([i, i - 4, i - 8])` modifies the list `ans` by appending a new list containing three elements: `i`, `i - 4`, and `i - 8`. However, the initial state does not provide the value of `i` or the contents of `ans`. Therefore, we can only express the changes in terms of `i`.

Since the initial state does not specify the value of `i`, we will assume that `i` is a specific integer value. The impact of the code is that a new list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]` is appended to the list `ans`.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing one additional element [i, i - 4, i - 8], where `i` is an integer.**
