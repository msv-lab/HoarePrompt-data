The code appends the list `[1, 2, ost[0]]` to the list `ans`. Since `ost` is a list containing one value (as mentioned in the precondition), `ost[0]` is the single element in `ost`. The value of `ost[0]` was determined before this code snippet, but it does not affect the structure of the lists post-execution.

Here's the updated state:

- `ans` now contains the additional element `[1, 2, ost[0]]`.
- `per` remains unchanged.
- `pos` remains unchanged.
- `ost` remains unchanged, still containing one value.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`ans` is a list containing all valid `[i, i-4, i-8]` triplets where `i > 8` and `i` is within the range defined by `per` and `n // 2`, plus an additional element `[1, 2, ost[0]]`; `per` remains unchanged; `pos` remains unchanged; `ost` is a list containing all values of `i` that do not meet the condition `i > 8` and its length is 1.**
