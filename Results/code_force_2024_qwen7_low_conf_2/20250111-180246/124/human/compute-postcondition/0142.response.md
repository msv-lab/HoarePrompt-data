`ost` appends the value of `i` to itself. The value of `i` is the next value in the sequence, which is the current value of `i` plus one (since `i` is incremented before this line of code). Therefore, `ost` now contains the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`results` will contain the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` remains unchanged, `t` must remain greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` will contain all valid triplets generated up to the current `n-1`, `ost` contains the previous value of `ost` plus the new value of `i`, `n` remains the same, `i` is the next value in the sequence (`i + 1`).**
