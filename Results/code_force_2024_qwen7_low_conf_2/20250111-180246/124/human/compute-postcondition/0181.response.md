Postcondition: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains the same, `pos`, `t`, `index`, `data`, and `n` remain unchanged, `ans` contains all valid triplets generated up to the point where `i` no longer satisfies `i > n // 2`, including possibly `[9, 5, 1]`, `ost` contains all values of `i` that do not satisfy the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)` until the loop terminates, and `i` is the final value of `i` when the loop terminates, which will be the largest value of `i` that was greater than `n // 2` and did not satisfy the condition, or `n` if no such value exists.**
