Postcondition: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines; `per` remains unchanged; `pos` is 15; `ans` includes triplets `[9, 10, 11]` and `[13, 14, 15]`; `i` is 13; `n` must be greater than 3 and less than 22; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` remains unchanged; `data` remains unchanged; `ost` is an empty list. If `i > n // 2 - 2`, then `results` is updated as specified in the if part; otherwise, the state remains as specified in the else part (which is none in this case).**
