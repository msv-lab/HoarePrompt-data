The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly but implies it processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it accepts two integers: `t` and `n`. `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^2\), and for each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\). Additionally, the sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^4\).

Case_1: If `t` is out of the specified range (i.e., \(t < 1\) or \(t > 10^2\)), the function returns an error message indicating that `t` is out of bounds.
Case_2: If `n` is out of the specified range (i.e., \(n < 3\) or \(n > 3 \cdot 10^4\)), the function returns an error message indicating that `n` is out of bounds.
Case_3: If both `t` and `n` are within their respective valid ranges, the function processes the test case and returns a specific output based on the logic implemented inside the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t` and `n` for each test case, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^2\) and `n` is an integer such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\). It returns an error message if `t` or `n` is out of its valid range, and processes the test case if both are within their valid ranges.**
