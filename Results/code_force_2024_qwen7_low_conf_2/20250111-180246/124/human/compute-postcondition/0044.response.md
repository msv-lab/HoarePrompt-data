Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `pos` is an integer list.
   - If `i` satisfies `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, then `pos` contains `[i]`. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for i in range(pos + 1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop starts from `pos + 1` and goes up to `n`.
   - For each value of `i` in this range, if it satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, then `pos` will contain `[i]`.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - To determine the next state, we need to find the smallest value of `i` in the range `[pos + 1, n]` that satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
   - If such an `i` exists, then `pos` will be updated to contain `[i]`.
   - If no such `i` exists, `pos` will remain unchanged.

5. **Identifying the New Values:**
   - Let's assume that at the end of the previous iteration, the smallest value of `i` that satisfied the condition was `k`, and thus `pos = [k]`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will start from `k + 1` (since `i` starts from `pos + 1`).
   - We need to check if there is any `i` in the range `[k + 1, n]` that satisfies the condition. If such an `i` exists, `pos` will be updated to `[i]`. If not, `pos` will remain `[k]`.

6. **Formulating the New State:**
   - If the next `i` that satisfies the condition is found, let's say it is `m`, then `pos` will be updated to `[m]`.
   - If no such `i` is found, `pos` will remain `[k]`.

Given these steps, let's formulate the new state:

- Assume `pos` at the end of the previous iteration was `[k]` (where `k` is the smallest value that satisfied the condition).
- The new state will depend on whether a new valid `i` (satisfying the condition) is found in the range `[k + 1, n]`.

Since we don't have specific values for `k`, `n`, and `pos`, the general form of the new state would be:

**State: **`pos` is an integer list. If the smallest valid `i` in the range `[pos[-1] + 1, n]` (if such an `i` exists) satisfies `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, then `pos` contains `[i]`. Otherwise, `pos` remains unchanged.**

However, to provide a concrete example, let's assume the following hypothetical values:
- `pos = [3]` (smallest valid `i` found in the previous iteration)
- `n = 10`

Then, the next `i` in the range `[4, 10]` that satisfies the condition could be `7` (since `7 % 2 != 0 and 7 > 10 // 2`).

So, the new state would be:

**State: **`pos` is `[7]` since `7` is the next valid `i` in the range `[4, 10]`.
