Postcondition: ***`results` will contain the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` remains unchanged, `t` must remain greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` will contain all valid triplets generated up to the current `n-1`, `ost` contains the previous value of `ost` plus the new value of `i`, `n` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1 to the next value in the sequence, and the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)` must be satisfied for the loop to continue.***
