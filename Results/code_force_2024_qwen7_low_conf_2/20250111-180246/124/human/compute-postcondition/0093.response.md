The code `ans.append([2, ost[2], ost[3]])` appends a new list `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]` to the list `ans`. The value of `ost[2]` and `ost[3]` are specific values from the list `ost`, which currently has 4 elements.

Given the initial state, the output state will be:
- `ans` now includes the new triplet `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`.
- `ost` remains unchanged, still containing 4 elements.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`ans` is a list containing all valid `[i, i-4, i-8]` triplets where `i > 8` and `i` is within the range defined by `per` and `n // 2`, plus the new triplet `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`, `ost` is a list containing all values of `i` that do not meet the condition `i > 8` and currently has 4 elements.**
