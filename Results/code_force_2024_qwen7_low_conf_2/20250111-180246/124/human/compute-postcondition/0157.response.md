Postcondition: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` is equal to either `n` or `n - 3` depending on whether `(n - 3) % 4 == 2`, `pos` remains unchanged, `t` must remain greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` will contain all valid triplets generated up to the final `n-1`, and `ost` contains a list of all values of `i` that satisfy the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)`, `n` remains the same, `i` will be the last value in the sequence where the condition is satisfied or `n` if no such value exists, and the loop terminates when `i` no longer satisfies the condition, and the current value of `(n - 3) % 4` is either 2 or not 2.**
