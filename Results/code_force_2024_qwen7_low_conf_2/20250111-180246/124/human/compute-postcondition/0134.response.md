The code `pos = i + 2` updates the value of `pos`. Initially, `i` is 13, so `pos` is updated to 15. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines; `per` remains unchanged; `pos` is 15; `ans` includes triplets `[9, 10, 11]` and `[13, 14, 15]`; `i` is 13; `n` must be greater than 3 and less than 22; `t` must be greater than 0; `index` remains unchanged; `data` remains unchanged; `ost` is an empty list.**
