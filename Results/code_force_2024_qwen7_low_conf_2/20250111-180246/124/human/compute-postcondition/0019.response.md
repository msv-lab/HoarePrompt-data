`results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a string representation of the list `x` to the list `results`. The value of `x` is taken from `data[2]`, which means `x` is `data[2]`. Given that `index` is 2, `data[2]` is either `[2, 6, 8]` or `[3, 5, 7]`.

Let's consider both cases:

1. If `data[2]` is `[2, 6, 8]`, then `' '.join(map(str, [2, 6, 8]))` results in the string `'2 6 8'`.
2. If `data[2]` is `[3, 5, 7]`, then `' '.join(map(str, [3, 5, 7]))` results in the string `'3 5 7'`.

Therefore, the updated `results` will be either `['1', '2 6 8', '2 6 8']` or `['1', '3 5 7', '3 5 7']`, depending on the value of `data[2]`.

Output State: **`total` is not applicable, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `n` is an integer derived from `data[2]`, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is 2, `results` is either `['1', '2 6 8', '2 6 8']` or `['1', '3 5 7', '3 5 7']`, `ans` is `[[[], [[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`**
