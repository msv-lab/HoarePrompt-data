The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` is 1, so after incrementing, `index` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer (derived from `data[0]`), `data` is a list of strings that must have at least one element, `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is `2`, `results` is an empty list**
