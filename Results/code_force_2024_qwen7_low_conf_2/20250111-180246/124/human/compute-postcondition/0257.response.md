Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial State:
- \( n \) is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
- \( i \) is the last value that satisfies the condition \((i \% 2 \neq 0 \text{ or } i \% 4 == 0) \text{ and } i > n // 2\).
- \( pos \) is the last value of \( i + 2 \).
- \( ans \) contains all lists of the form \([i, i + 1, i + 2]\) for each valid \( i \).
- \( ost \) contains all valid \( i \) values that meet the condition.
- \( per \) is equal to either \( n - 1 \), \( n - 2 \), \( n - 3 \), or \( n \) depending on the value of \( n \) modulo 4.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(per, n // 2, -12):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Initial Value of \( i \)**: The loop starts from \( per \) and decrements by 12 until it reaches or falls below \( n // 2 \).

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as the starting value of \( i \) (which is \( per \)) is greater than or equal to \( n // 2 \) and the decrement value (-12) ensures that the loop continues until \( i \) is less than \( n // 2 \).

3. **Ensuring \( i \) is Valid**:
   - Since \( i \) must satisfy the condition \((i \% 2 \neq 0 \text{ or } i \% 4 == 0) \text{ and } i > n // 2\) at the start, we need to ensure that the starting value \( per \) meets this condition.

4. **Ensuring \( per \) is Correct**:
   - \( per \) is one of \( n - 1 \), \( n - 2 \), \( n - 3 \), or \( n \) based on \( n \mod 4 \). We need to check which one fits the requirement.

5. **Ensuring \( per \geq n // 2 \)**:
   - The starting value \( per \) must be at least \( n // 2 \) for the loop to execute.

### Adjusted States:
- Ensure that \( per \) is one of \( n - 1 \), \( n - 2 \), \( n - 3 \), or \( n \) and that it is at least \( n // 2 \).

Given the above analysis, we can summarize the required states:

**State:**
- \( n \) is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
- \( i \) is the last value that satisfies the condition \((i \% 2 \neq 0 \text{ or } i \% 4 == 0) \text{ and } i > n // 2\).
- \( pos \) is the last value of \( i + 2 \).
- \( ans \) contains all lists of the form \([i, i + 1, i + 2]\) for each valid \( i \).
- \( ost \) contains all valid \( i \) values that meet the condition.
- \( per \) is one of \( n - 1 \), \( n - 2 \), \( n - 3 \), or \( n \) and is at least \( n // 2 \).

In simpler terms:
- \( n \) is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
- \( per \) is \( n - 1 \), \( n - 2 \), \( n - 3 \), or \( n \) and \( per \geq n // 2 \).
- \( i \) is the last value that satisfies the condition \((i \% 2 \neq 0 \text{ or } i \% 4 == 0) \text{ and } i > n // 2\).
- \( pos \) is the last value of \( i + 2 \).
- \( ans \) contains all lists of the form \([i, i + 1, i + 2]\) for each valid \( i \).
- \( ost \) contains all valid \( i \) values that meet the condition.
- \( i = per \).

So, the final state is:

**State:** **\( n \) is an integer greater than or equal to 3, \( per \) is \( n - 1 \), \( n - 2 \), \( n - 3 \), or \( n \) and \( per \geq n // 2 \), \( i \) is the last value that satisfies the condition \((i \% 2 \neq 0 \text{ or } i \% 4 == 0) \text{ and } i > n // 2\), \( pos \) is the last value of \( i + 2 \), \( ans \) contains all lists of the form \([i, i + 1, i + 2]\) for each valid \( i \), \( ost \) contains all valid \( i \) values that meet the condition, \( i = per \)**.
