`ans` is appended with a new list containing the first three elements of `ost`. The values of `per`, `pos`, `t`, `index`, `data`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is the final value when the loop terminates, and `len(ost) == 3` remains true.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains the same, `pos`, `t`, `index`, `data`, and `n` remain unchanged, `ans` contains all valid triplets including `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]`, `ost` contains all values of `i` that do not satisfy the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)` until the loop terminates, and `i` is the final value of `i` when the loop terminates, which will be either the largest value of `i` that was greater than `n // 2` and did not satisfy the condition or `n` if no such value exists, and `len(ost) == 3`**.
