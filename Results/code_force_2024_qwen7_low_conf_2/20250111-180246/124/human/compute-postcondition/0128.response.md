Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop conditions**: The loop runs for values of `i` in the range from `3` to `n-1` with a step of `4`.
   - The loop condition is `i in range(3, n - 1, 4)`.

2. **Current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines.
   - `per` remains unchanged.
   - `pos` is `6`.
   - `t` must be greater than `0`.
   - `index` remains unchanged.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5]`.
   - `ost` is an empty list.
   - `n` must be greater than `3`.
   - `i` is either `6` or has reached `n-1` depending on the condition `i > n // 2 - 2`.

3. **Determine the next value of `i`**:
   - Since `i` was `6` (or possibly `n-1` if it had reached that point), we need to check the next possible value of `i` in the range.
   - The next value of `i` would be `9` (since `i` increases by `4`).

4. **Check the condition for the next iteration**:
   - The condition `i > n // 2 - 2` must be checked to see if the loop can continue.
   - Given that `i` is now `9`, we need to ensure that `9` is still within the valid range for the loop, i.e., `3 <= 9 < n`.

5. **Adjust the states**:
   - `i` will be set to `9`.
   - `n` must remain greater than `3`.
   - All other variables (`results`, `per`, `pos`, `t`, `index`, `data`, `ans`, `ost`) remain unchanged.

**Final state adjustment**:
State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` is 6, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5]`, `ost` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 9**
