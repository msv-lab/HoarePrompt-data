Postcondition: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` is set to a value that is at least `n // 2`, `pos` remains unchanged, `t` must remain greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` will contain all valid triplets generated up to the final `n-1`, `ost` contains a list of all values of `i` that satisfy the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)`, `n` remains the same, `i` is now the last value in the sequence where the condition `i > n // 2` is satisfied and it is greater than 8, and the loop terminates when `i` no longer satisfies the condition `(i > n // 2)`**
