The code `per = n - 1` simply assigns the value of `n - 1` to the variable `per`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. The initial conditions state that `n` satisfies `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`. Since `per` is just a new variable holding the value of `n - 1`, the output state will reflect this assignment.

Output State: **`pos` is an integer list that contains all integers `i` in the range `[pos[-1] + 1, n]` such that `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`; `per` is `n - 1`; the current value of `n` is such that `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`.**
