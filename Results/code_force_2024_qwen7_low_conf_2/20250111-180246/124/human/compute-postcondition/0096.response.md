Postcondition: ***`pos` remains unchanged, `per` remains unchanged. If `len(ost) == 2`, `ans` now includes the additional element `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]` and `ost` remains unchanged with exactly 2 elements. If `len(ost) != 2`, `ans` is a list containing all valid \([i, i-4, i-8]\) triplets where \(i > 8\) and \(i\) is within the range defined by `per` and \(n // 2\). If `len(ost) == 3`, `ost` becomes an empty list. If `len(ost) == 4`, `ans` includes the additional triplet `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]` and `ost` remains a list of 4 elements containing values that do not meet the condition \(i > 8\).***
