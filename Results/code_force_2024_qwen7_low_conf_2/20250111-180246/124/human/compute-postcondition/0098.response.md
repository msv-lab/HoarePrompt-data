The code appends the length of the `ans` list to the `results` list as a formatted string. The length of `ans` is determined by the number of valid `[i, i-4, i-8]` triplets that meet the conditions specified in the initial state. However, since the code does not modify the values of `ans`, `per`, `pos`, or `ost`, and only appends the length of `ans` to `results`, the output state will include the length of `ans` added to `results`.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is a list containing all valid `[i, i-4, i-8]` triplets where `i > 8` and `i` is within the range defined by `per` and `n // 2`.
- If `len(ost) == 1`, `ans` includes the additional element `[1, 2, ost[0]]`.
- If `len(ost) == 2`, `ans` includes the additional element `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]`.
- If `len(ost) == 3`, `ost` becomes an empty list.
- If `len(ost) == 4`, `ans` includes the additional element `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`.
- `per` and `pos` remain unchanged.
- `ost` is a list containing values that do not meet the condition `i > 8`.

After running the code snippet, `results` will contain the length of `ans` appended as a string.

Output State: **`ans` is a list containing all valid `[i, i-4, i-8]` triplets where `i > 8` and `i` is within the range defined by `per` and `n // 2`; `per` and `pos` remain unchanged; `ost` is a list containing values that do not meet the condition `i > 8`; `results` contains the string representation of the length of `ans`.**
