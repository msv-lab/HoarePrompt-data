`ost` is appended with the value of `i`, which is 10. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `i` is 10, `pos` is 8, `ans` contains all lists of the form `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` for each valid `i`, and `ost` now includes the value 10.

Output State: **`i` is 10, `pos` is 8, `ans` contains all lists of the form `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` for each valid `i`, `ost` is ['ost' remains unchanged, 10]**
