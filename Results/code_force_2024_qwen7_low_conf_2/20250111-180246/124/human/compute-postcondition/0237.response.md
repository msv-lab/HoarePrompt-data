Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is the largest integer such that `i <= n // 2 - 2` and satisfies the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `ans` contains all lists of the form `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` for each valid `i`, and `pos` is the last value of `i + 2` and must satisfy `pos + 1 <= n + 1`; if `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2` is true, then `ost` is a list containing the value of `i`. Otherwise, `ost` remains unchanged.***
