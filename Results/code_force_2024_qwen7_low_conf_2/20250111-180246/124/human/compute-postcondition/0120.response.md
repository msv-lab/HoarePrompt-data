The code initializes an empty list `ans`. This means that the list `ans` will now contain no elements, while the other variables (`results`, `per`, `pos`, `t`, `index`, and `data`) remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` remains unchanged, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` is an empty list**
