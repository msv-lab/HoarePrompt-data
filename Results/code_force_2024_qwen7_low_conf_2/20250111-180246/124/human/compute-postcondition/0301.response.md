The code `sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')` writes the contents of the `results` list to the standard output, with each element separated by a newline character. This operation does not change the state of any variables but rather outputs the contents of the `results` list.

Given the initial state:
- `ans` is a list of valid triplets generated based on the values of `n` in `data`.
- `per` and `pos` retain their last computed values.
- `results` is a list containing the number of valid triplets followed by the triplets themselves.

Since no variables are being updated or changed by this code snippet, the only thing that happens is the output of the `results` list. The values of `ans`, `per`, and `pos` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`ans` is a list of valid triplets generated based on the values of `n` in `data`, `per` retains its last computed value, `pos` retains its last computed value, and the contents of the `results` list are written to the standard output.**
