Postcondition: **`i` is 10, `pos` is 8, `ans` contains all lists of the form `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` for each valid `i`, and `ost` remains unchanged. If `i` is an odd number not divisible by 4 or if `i` is less than or equal to half of `n`, the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2` is false and no changes are made to `ans` and `ost`. Otherwise, `ost` is updated to include the value `10`.**
