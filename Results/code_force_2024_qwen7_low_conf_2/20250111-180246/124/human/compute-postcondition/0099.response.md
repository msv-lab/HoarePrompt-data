Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `ans` is a list containing all valid `[i, i-4, i-8]` triplets where `i > 8` and `i` is within the range defined by `per` and `n // 2`.
   - `per` and `pos` remain unchanged.
   - `ost` is a list containing values that do not meet the condition `i > 8`.
   - `results` contains the string representation of the length of `ans`.

2. **For Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element `x` in `ans`.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute, `ans` must contain at least one element. This means there must be at least one valid triplet in `ans`.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since `ans` must contain at least one valid triplet, we need to ensure that there is at least one such triplet in `ans`.
   - We also need to ensure that `per` and `pos` remain unchanged during the loop.

Given these points, let's summarize the required state adjustments:

- `ans` must contain at least one valid triplet.
- `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged.
- `ost` can contain any elements as long as they do not affect the validity of the triplets in `ans`.
- `results` should reflect the current length of `ans`, but this is more of an output state rather than an input state to the loop.

Therefore, the final state adjustment needed for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`ans` must contain at least one valid triplet, `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged**.
