To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the requirements based on the given for loop:

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The for loop iterates over the range from `per` to `n // 2` in steps of `-12`. For the loop to execute, the following conditions must hold:
   - The starting value of `i` (which is `per`) must be greater than `n // 2` (inclusive).
   - The loop should continue as long as `i` is greater than `n // 2` but less than `n // 2` minus the total number of steps (which is a multiple of 12).

2. **Condition on `per`**: 
   - Since the loop starts from `per` and goes down to `n // 2` in steps of `-12`, `per` must be greater than `n // 2` to ensure the loop runs.

3. **Condition on `n`**:
   - The loop step is `-12`, so the total number of iterations is determined by the difference between `per` and `n // 2`, divided by 12. This implies that `per` must be within a range that allows for a positive number of iterations.
   - Additionally, `n` must be such that `n // 2` is a valid boundary for the loop, and `per` must be a valid starting point for these conditions.

4. **Conditions on `pos` and `per`**:
   - `pos` is a list that contains integers `i` in the specified range. This means `pos` must contain values that fit the criteria `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
   - `per` is defined based on the conditions involving `n - 1`, `n - 2`, and `n - 3`. Therefore, `per` must be one of `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` depending on the modulus conditions.

### Required Adjustments:

- **`pos`**: Ensure that `pos` contains valid integers based on the specified criteria.
- **`per`**: Ensure that `per` is correctly set according to the conditions mentioned.
- **`n`**: Ensure that `n` is such that the loop can start from `per` and decrement to `n // 2` in steps of `-12`.

### Final State:

- `pos` must contain integers that satisfy `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.
- `per` must be one of `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the specified conditions.
- `n` must be such that `n // 2` is a valid boundary and `per` is a valid starting point.

Therefore, the required state is:

**State: `pos` must contain integers that satisfy `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `per` must be one of `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the specified conditions, and `n` must be such that `n // 2` is a valid boundary and `per` is a valid starting point.**
