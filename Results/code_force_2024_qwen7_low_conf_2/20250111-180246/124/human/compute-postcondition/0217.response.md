`ans` is assigned an empty list. The value of `index` is increased by 1 (but its new value is not specified since the initial value was not given), `results` is still a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`, `ans1` and `ans2` remain unchanged, `data[index-1]` remains an existing and integer value, `t` remains greater than 0, and the condition regarding `n` and `x` does not change.

Output State: **`index` is increased by 1; `ans` is an empty list; `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`; `ans1` is a list containing valid elements; `ans2` is a list containing valid elements; `data[index-1]` is an existing and integer value; `t` is greater than 0; if `n` is in `ans1`, then `x` is the last element in `ans`.**
