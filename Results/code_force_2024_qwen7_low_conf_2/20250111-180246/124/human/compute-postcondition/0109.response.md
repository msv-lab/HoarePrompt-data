The code assigns the value of `ans2[ans1.index(n)]` to `ans`. Here, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`. This means `ans` now holds the value at the index in `ans2` where `n` is found in `ans1`.

Given this, the following changes occur:

- `ans` is updated to the value of `ans2[ans1.index(n)]`.
- `index` is incremented by 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, which remains unchanged from its previous value.

The states of `per`, `pos`, and `results` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`ans` is `ans2[ans1.index(n)]`, `index` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `per` and `pos` remain unchanged, `results` contains the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, and `t` must be greater than 0.**
