Postcondition: ***`pos` is an integer list that contains all integers `i` in the range `[pos[-1] + 1, n]` such that `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. `per` is either `n - 1`, `n - 2`, `n - 3`, or remains `n` depending on the conditions `(n - 1) % 4 == 2`, `(n - 2) % 4 == 2`, or `(n - 3) % 4 == 2`.***

This postcondition encompasses all possible outcomes of the if-else block, summarizing the state of `pos` and `per` after the execution of the if-else statement.
