The code appends a formatted string to the `results` list. Since `results` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a list that is being used to store results. The value appended to `results` is a string representation of the length of `ans`.

To determine the exact state, we need to consider the different cases for the length of `ost`:

1. If the length of `ost` is 1, then `ans` is `[1, 2, ost[0]]`.
2. If the length of `ost` is 2, then `ans` is `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]`.
3. If the length of `ost` is 3, then `ans` is `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]`.
4. If the length of `ost` is 4, then `ans` is `[[1, 'o', 's'], [2, 'x', 'x']]`.
5. For all other lengths, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.

Since the exact length of `ost` is not specified, we will consider the general case where `ans` might be one of these forms. However, the code only appends the length of `ans` to `results`, so the specific contents of `ans` do not affect the final output state of the variables.

Output State: **`ost` is a string, `ans` is a list whose length depends on the length of `ost`; `results` is a list containing a single element which is the length of `ans`**.
