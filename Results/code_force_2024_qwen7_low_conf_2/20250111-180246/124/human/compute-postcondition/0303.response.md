Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases where each test case involves an integer \(n\) such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\). For each \(n\), the function generates valid triplets based on certain conditions and appends these triplets to a result list. If \(n\) is found in a predefined list `ans1`, it retrieves precomputed triplets from `ans2`. Otherwise, it computes the triplets according to specific rules involving arithmetic progressions and modulo operations. The function then outputs the number of generated triplets followed by the triplets themselves, formatted as a series of lines in the standard output. The function handles edge cases where \(n\) might not fit into the predefined list and ensures that the output adheres to the constraints specified.**
