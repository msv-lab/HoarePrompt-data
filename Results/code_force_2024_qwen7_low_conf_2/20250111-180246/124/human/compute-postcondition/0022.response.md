Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `n` is an integer derived from `data[2]`, `ans1` is [8], `ans2` is [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]], `index` is 2, `results` is ['1', '2 6 8', '3 5 7'], `ans` is [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]. If `n` is in `ans1`, then `results` is updated to ['1', '2 6 8', '3 5 7'], and `ans` remains as [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]. Otherwise, the values of the variables remain unchanged.***
