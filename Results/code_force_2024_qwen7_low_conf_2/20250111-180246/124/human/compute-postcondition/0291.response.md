Postcondition: **`ost` is a string, and `ans` is a list. If the length of `ost` is 1, then `ans` contains the list `[1, 2, ost[0]]`. If the length of `ost` is 2, then `ans` contains the list `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]`. If the length of `ost` is 3, then `ans` contains the list `[ost[0], ost[1], ost[2]]`. If the length of `ost` is 4, then `ans` is set to `[[1, 'o', 's'], [2, 'x', 'x']]`. For all other lengths, the value of `ans` remains unchanged.**
