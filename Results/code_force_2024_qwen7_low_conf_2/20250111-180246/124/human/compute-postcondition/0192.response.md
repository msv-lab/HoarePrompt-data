Postcondition: ***`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines; `per`, `pos`, `t`, `index`, `data`, and `n` remain unchanged; `ans` contains all valid triplets including possibly `[9, 5, 1]` and `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`; `ost` contains all values of `i` that do not satisfy the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)` until the loop terminates, and its length is 3 or 4; `i` is the final value of `i` when the loop terminates, which will be either the largest value of `i` that was greater than `n // 2` and did not satisfy the condition or `n` if no such value exists.***
