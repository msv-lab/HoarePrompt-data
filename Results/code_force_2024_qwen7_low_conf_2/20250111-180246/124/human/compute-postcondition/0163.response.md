`ans` is appended with the list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`. Since `i` is the last value in the sequence where `i > n // 2` and it is greater than 8, let's denote the value of `i` as `i_val`. Therefore, the last value of `i` (which is also the current value since the loop just terminated) is added to `ans` as a new triplet.

Given that `i` is the last value satisfying `i > n // 2` and is greater than 8, let's assume `i_val = 9` for simplicity (since it must be greater than 8 and satisfy `i > n // 2`). Thus, the new triplet added to `ans` would be `[9, 5, 1]`.

The output state is as follows:

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` is set to a value that is at least `n // 2`, `pos` remains unchanged, `t` must remain greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` now contains all valid triplets including `[9, 5, 1]`, `ost` contains a list of all values of `i` that satisfy the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)`, `n` remains the same, `i` is 9.**
