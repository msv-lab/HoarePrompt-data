Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` must be greater than 4.
   - `i` is 3.
   - If `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`, then `ans` is `[3, 4, 5]` and `pos` is 5. Otherwise, no changes are made to `ans` and `pos` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` starting from 3 up to `n-1` with a step of 4.
   - The loop condition for the next iteration is `i < n - 1`.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

4. **Condition for Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` must satisfy `i < n - 1`.
   - Given `i` is currently 3, the condition `3 < n - 1` must hold true, meaning `n > 4`, which is already satisfied.

5. **Adjusting the State:**
   - Since the loop condition is met, `i` will be incremented by 4 (the step size in the loop).
   - Therefore, `i` will become `3 + 4 = 7`.

6. **Checking the Condition to Change `ans` and `pos`:**
   - We need to check if `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2` to determine if `ans` and `pos` need to be updated.
   - The condition to update `ans` and `pos` is `i > n // 2 - 2`.
   - Substituting `i = 7`, we get `7 > n // 2 - 2`.
   - Simplifying, `7 + 2 > n // 2` or `9 > n // 2` or `n < 18`.
   - Since `n` must be greater than 4, we assume `n` is such that `9 > n // 2` holds true, meaning `n` is less than 18.

7. **Final State Adjustment:**
   - If `n` is less than 18, `ans` will be updated to `[3, 4, 5]` and `pos` will be set to 5.
   - If `n` is 18 or greater, `ans` and `pos` will remain unchanged.

Given the constraints, the final state before the next iteration is:

State: **`n` must be greater than 4 and less than 18, `i` is 7, `ans` is `[3, 4, 5]` and `pos` is 5.** 

However, since the exact value of `n` is not specified and we need to cover all possible valid values, we can generalize it as follows:

State: **`n` must be greater than 4 and less than 18, `i` is 7, `ans` is `[3, 4, 5]` and `pos` is 5.**
