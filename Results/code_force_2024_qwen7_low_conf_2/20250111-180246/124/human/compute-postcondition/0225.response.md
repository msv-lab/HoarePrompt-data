According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from 3 up to `n-1` with a step of 4. The loop condition for executing again depends on the value of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3.
- `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2`.
- `ans` is `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`.
- `pos` is `i + 2`.

To determine the next state, we need to consider the next value of `i` that satisfies the loop condition.

1. The current value of `i` is such that it is greater than `n // 2 - 2`.
2. The loop increments `i` by 4 each iteration.

Let's find the next possible value of `i`:

- Current `i` is greater than `n // 2 - 2`.
- Next `i` will be `i + 4`.

For the loop to execute again, `i + 4` must still satisfy the condition of being greater than `n // 2 - 2`.

Given that `i` is currently greater than `n // 2 - 2`, adding 4 to `i` should still keep it valid unless `i + 4` becomes less than or equal to `n // 2 - 2`. However, since the problem does not provide any information suggesting that this would happen (and given the step size of 4), we can assume `i + 4` will still be valid as long as `n` is sufficiently large.

Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `i + 4`.

So, the updated states are:
- `i` will be `i + 4`.
- `ans` will update to `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` with the new `i`.
- `pos` will be `i + 2`.

The state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2` and equals `i + 4`, `ans` is `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]`, and `pos` is `i + 6`**.
