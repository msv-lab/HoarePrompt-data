Postcondition: **`pos` contains integers that satisfy `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`, `per` must be one of `n - 1`, `n - 2`, or `n - 3` based on the specified conditions, and `n` must be such that `n // 2` is a valid boundary and `per` is a valid starting point, and `i` is a value less than or equal to 8**
