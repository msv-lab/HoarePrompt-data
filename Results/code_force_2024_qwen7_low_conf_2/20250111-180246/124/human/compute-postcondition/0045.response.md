`pos` is updated by appending `i` to the list. The condition to determine if `i` should be appended involves checking if `i` is within a certain range and meets a specific condition. However, since the exact value of `i` is not given, we can only state that `i` is appended to `pos` if it meets the specified condition. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`pos` is now a list containing its original elements plus `i` if `i` satisfies the condition `i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0` and `i > n // 2`, otherwise `pos` remains unchanged.**
