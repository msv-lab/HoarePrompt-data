The variable `pos` is assigned the value `0`. This assignment does not affect any other variables. The values of `index`, `ans`, `results`, `ans1`, `ans2`, `data[index-1]`, `t`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`index` is increased by 1; `ans` is an empty list; `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`; `ans1` is a list containing valid elements; `ans2` is a list containing valid elements; `data[index-1]` is an existing and integer value; `t` is greater than 0; `pos` is 0; if `n` is in `ans1`, then `x` is the last element in `ans`.**
