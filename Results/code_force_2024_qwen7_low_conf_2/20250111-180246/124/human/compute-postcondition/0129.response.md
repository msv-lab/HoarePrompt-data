`ans` is a list that originally contains `[3, 4, 5]`. The code appends a new list `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to `ans`. Given that `i` is 9, the new list appended is `[9, 10, 11]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` is 6, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` contains `[3, 4, 5, [9, 10, 11]]`, `ost` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 3, `i` is 9**
