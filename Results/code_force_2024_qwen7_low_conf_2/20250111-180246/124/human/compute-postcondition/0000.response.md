The given code snippet is `input = sys.stdin.read`. This line reassigns the built-in `input` function to the method `sys.stdin.read`, which reads the entire input from standard input as a single string, instead of reading it line by line.

However, this code does not affect the values of `t` or `n`, nor does it perform any operations that would modify the values of these variables. It only changes how the `input` function works.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^2, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^4. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot 10^4.**
