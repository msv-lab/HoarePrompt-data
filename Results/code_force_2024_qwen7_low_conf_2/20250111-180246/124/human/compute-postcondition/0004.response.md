The code `index = 0` assigns the integer value 0 to the variable `index`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 100, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 30000, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `ans1` is `[8]`, `ans2` is `[[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]`, `index` is `0**`.
