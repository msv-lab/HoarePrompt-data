The code appends the length of the list `ans` to the list `results`. Let's break down the steps:

1. `results` is a list containing the string representations of triplets in `ans` formatted as `' '.join(map(str, x))`.
2. `ans` is updated based on `ans2[ans1.index(data[index-1])]`.
3. `t` must be greater than 0.
4. `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`.

The code `results.append(f'{len(ans)}')` appends the length of the list `ans` as a string to the list `results`. Since the length of `ans` is not specified initially, let's denote the length of `ans` as `L`.

After executing the code, the following changes occur:
- The length of `ans` (denoted as `L`) is appended as a string to `results`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `index` is increased by 2.
- `results` now contains the string representation of the length of `ans` in addition to its previous contents.
- `ans` is updated based on `ans2[ans1.index(data[index-1])]`.
- `t` must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`.

Output State: **`index` is increased by 2, `results` is a list that now contains the string representation of the length of `ans` in addition to its previous contents, `ans` is updated based on `ans2[ans1.index(data[index-1])]`, `t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index-1]`**.
