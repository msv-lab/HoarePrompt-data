The code appends a list `[1, ost[0], ost[1]]` to the variable `ans`. Given that `ost` is a string with a length of 4, `ost[0]` and `ost[1]` are the first and second characters of `ost` respectively. Since `ans` is not mentioned in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this code execution. After appending, `ans` will contain the list `[1, ost[0], ost[1]]`.

Output State: **`ost` is a string with a length of 4; `ans` contains `[1, ost[0], ost[1]]`**
