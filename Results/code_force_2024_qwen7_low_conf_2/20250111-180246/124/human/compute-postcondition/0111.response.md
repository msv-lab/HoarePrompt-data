Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Variables**: The loop iterates over each element in the list `ans`. The loop variable here is `x`.

2. **Determine the Initial State**:
   - `ans` is defined as `ans2[ans1.index(n)]`.
   - `index` is incremented by 1.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.
   - `per` and `pos` remain unchanged.
   - `results` contains the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.

3. **Check Conditions for Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, the list `ans` must contain at least one element because the loop iterates over each element in `ans`.
   - The variable `t` must be greater than 0, as stated in the initial state.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since the loop depends on the presence of elements in `ans`, we need to ensure that `ans` is not empty.
   - We also need to ensure that `t > 0`.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states to ensure the loop can execute.

**State:**
- `ans` must not be an empty list (i.e., `ans` must have at least one element).
- `t` must be greater than 0.

The final answer is:
State: **`ans` must not be an empty list, `t` must be greater than 0**
