The code initializes an empty list `ost`. No changes are made to the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` is 0, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` is an empty list, `ost` is an empty list**
