`results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` appends a new element to the `results` list. This new element is a string that represents the elements of the list `x` joined by spaces. The other variables (`ans`, `per`, and `pos`) are not affected.

Assuming `x` is a list containing the elements that need to be converted to a string and joined, the new element in `results` will be a string of these elements separated by spaces.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one valid triplet, `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged, `results` contains an additional element which is a string representation of the next `x` joined by spaces**
