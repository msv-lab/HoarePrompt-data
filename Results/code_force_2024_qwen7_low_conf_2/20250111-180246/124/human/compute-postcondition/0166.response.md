Postcondition: ***`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` is set to a value that is at least `n // 2`, `pos` remains unchanged, `t` must remain greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` now contains all valid triplets, including possibly `[9, 5, 1]`, `ost` contains a list of all values of `i` that satisfy the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)`, `n` remains the same, `i` is either 9 if the condition `i > 8` is true or the current value satisfying the condition if it is false.***
