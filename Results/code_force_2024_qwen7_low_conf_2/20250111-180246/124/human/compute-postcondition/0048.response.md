`pos` is an integer list, and the next value of `i` (which is `pos[-1] + 2`) must satisfy the condition `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. The code appends the value of `i` to the list `pos`.

To find the new value of `i`, we first need to determine the current last element of `pos` and add 2 to it. However, since the exact value of `n` is not given, we cannot specify the exact value of `i`. We know that `i` must satisfy the given condition.

Let's denote the last element of `pos` as `last_pos`. Then, `i = last_pos + 2`. This value of `i` must satisfy `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`.

After appending `i` to `pos`, the length of `pos` increases by 1.

Output State: **`pos` is an integer list with the last element being `pos[-1] + 2`, and this value must satisfy `(pos[-1] + 2 % 2 != 0 or pos[-1] + 2 % 4 == 0) and pos[-1] + 2 > n // 2`; the length of `pos` is one more than its original length.**
