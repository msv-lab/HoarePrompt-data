`pos` is reassigned to `i + 2`. The previous value of `pos` was `i + 10`, so now it is updated. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer equal to `i + 4`, `ans` is `[[i, i + 1, i + 2], [i + 8, i + 9, i + 10, i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]]`, and `pos` is `i + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer equal to `i + 4`, `ans` is `[[i, i + 1, i + 2], [i + 8, i + 9, i + 10, i + 4, i + 5, i + 6]]`, and `pos` is `i + 2`**
