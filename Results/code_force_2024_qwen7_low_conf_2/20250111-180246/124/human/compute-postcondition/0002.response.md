The code initializes `ans1` with the value `[8]`. This assignment does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, or `data`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans1`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^2, `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ n ≤ 3 \cdot 10^4, `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string, `ans1` is `[8]`**
