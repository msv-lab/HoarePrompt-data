The code `ans.append([i, i + 1, i + 2])` appends a list containing `[i, i + 1, i + 2]` to the list `ans`. Since `ans` was not defined in the initial state, it will be initialized as an empty list before this operation. The values of `i` are such that `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. After appending the list, the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2`, `ans` is `[i, i + 1, i + 2]`**
