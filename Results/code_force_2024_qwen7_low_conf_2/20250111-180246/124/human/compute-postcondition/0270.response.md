To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the current values of `i`, `per`, and `n`, and how the loop condition and the given code affect these values.

Given:
- At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `i_{\text{prev}} - 12`.
- If `i > 8`, then `ans` contains `[i_{\text{prev}} - 12, i_{\text{prev}} - 16, i_{\text{prev}} - 20]`. Otherwise, `ans` remains as its original value, and `ost` is a list containing `i_{\text{prev}} - 12`.
- The loop iterates over `range(per, n // 2, -12)`.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i = i_{\text{prev}} - 12`.
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` in the range `per` to `n // 2` (inclusive) with a step of `-12`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `i` should be `i - 12`, and it should still satisfy the loop condition:
- `i - 12 >= per` (since the step is `-12`, the next value of `i` would be `i - 12`).
- Also, `i - 12 <= n // 2`.

Given that `i` is `i_{\text{prev}} - 12` at the end of the previous iteration, the next value of `i` would be `i_{\text{prev}} - 24`.

Next, we need to check if this new value of `i` (`i_{\text{prev}} - 24`) satisfies the loop condition:
- `i_{\text{prev}} - 24 >= per`
- `i_{\text{prev}} - 24 <= n // 2`

If both conditions are satisfied, the loop will continue. 

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `i_{\text{prev}} - 24`.
- `ost` will contain `i_{\text{prev}} - 24` if `i_{\text{prev}} - 24 > 8`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged and `ost` contains `i_{\text{prev}} - 24`.

So, the final state is:
State: **`i` is `i_{\text{prev}} - 24`, `ost` contains `i_{\text{prev}} - 24` if `i_{\text{prev}} - 24 > 8`, otherwise `ans` remains unchanged and `ost` contains `i_{\text{prev}} - 24`**.
