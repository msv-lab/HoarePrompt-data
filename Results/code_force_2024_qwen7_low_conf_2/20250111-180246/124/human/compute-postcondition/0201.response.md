The code appends a new element to the `results` list. The new element is a string representation of the list `x`, joined by spaces. Since `results` was described as having either the initial element `[' '.join(map(str, x))]` (if it was initially empty) or including this element along with the original elements, and `x` is unchanged, the new element added to `results` will be `' '.join(map(str, x))`.

Given that `ans` must have at least two elements remaining, the structure of `ans` is not directly impacted by this code. The output state will reflect the updated `results` list.

Output State: **`results` is now `[' '.join(map(str, x))]` plus the original elements plus the new element `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `x` is unchanged, `ans` must have at least two elements remaining**
