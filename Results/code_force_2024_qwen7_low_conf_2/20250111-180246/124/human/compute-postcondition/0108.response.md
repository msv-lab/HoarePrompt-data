The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. This affects only the `index` variable, while all other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `index` and retains the initial states of `ans`, `per`, `pos`, `results`, `t`, and `n`.

Output State: **`ans` must contain at least one valid triplet, `per` and `pos` must remain unchanged, `results` contains the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `t` must be greater than 0, `index` is incremented by 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
