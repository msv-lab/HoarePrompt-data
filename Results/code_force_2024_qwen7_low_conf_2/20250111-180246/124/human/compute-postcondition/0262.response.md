`ost.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `ost`. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the function does not reassign it. The precondition that `i` is an integer greater than `n` divided by 2 and less than or equal to 8 still holds. Therefore, the updated information includes the fact that `i` is appended to `ost`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer greater than `n` / 2 and less than or equal to 8; `ost` contains `[i]`**
