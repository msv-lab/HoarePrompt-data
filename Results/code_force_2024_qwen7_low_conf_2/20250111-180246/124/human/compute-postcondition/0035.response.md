Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is an integer greater than 4 and less than 18.
   - `i` is 7.
   - `ans` is `[3, 4, 5, [7, 8, 9]]`.
   - `pos` is 9.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs with `i` in the range from 3 to `n - 1` (inclusive) with a step of 4.

3. **Current Value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 7.

4. **Next Possible Value of `i`:**
   - The next possible value for `i` would be 7 + 4 = 11, as the loop increments by 4 each time.

5. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The condition for the loop to continue is that `i` should be within the specified range: `3 ≤ i < n - 1`.

6. **Check the Range:**
   - Given that `n` is between 5 and 17 (since it's an integer greater than 4 and less than 18), the upper limit of the loop (`n - 1`) ranges from 4 to 16.
   - For `i` to be 11, `n - 1` must be at least 11, meaning `n` must be at least 12.

7. **Update States:**
   - `i` will become 11.
   - `n` must remain in the range 5 to 17 but now must be such that `n - 1 ≥ 11`, so `n` must be at least 12.
   - `ans` and `pos` remain unchanged as the loop body is omitted and there is no additional assignment in the condition provided.

**Final State:**
- `n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 12 and less than 18.
- `i` is 11.
- `ans` remains `[3, 4, 5, [7, 8, 9]]`.
- `pos` remains 9.

**Answer:**
State: **`n` must be an integer greater than or equal to 12 and less than 18, `i` is 11, `ans` is `[3, 4, 5, [7, 8, 9]]`, `pos` is 9.**
