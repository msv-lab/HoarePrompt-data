Step-by-step analysis:

1. The initial state is given as:
   - `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3
   - `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2` and equals `i + 4`
   - `ans` is `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6, i, i + 1, i + 2]`
   - `pos` is `i + 6`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```
   pos = i + 2
   ```

3. The line `pos = i + 2` updates the value of `pos` to `i + 2`. This does not affect `n`, `i`, `ans`, or the original value of `pos`.

4. Since `i` was already equal to `i + 4`, this line effectively sets `pos` to `i + 2`, which simplifies to `(i + 4) + 2 = i + 6`. Therefore, `pos` is now equal to `i + 6`, the same as its original value.

5. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 3, `i` is an integer greater than `n // 2 - 2` and equals `i + 4`, `ans` is `[i + 4, i + 5, i + 6, i, i + 1, i + 2]`, and `pos` is `i + 6`**
