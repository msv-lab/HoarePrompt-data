Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines.
   - `per` remains unchanged.
   - `pos` must be greater than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - `t` must be greater than 0.
   - `index` remains unchanged.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` contains all valid triplets generated up to `n-1`.
   - `ost` is a list containing the value of `i`.
   - `n` must be greater than 3.
   - `i` must be greater than or equal to `n + 2`.
   - If the current value of `i` satisfies the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)`, the function continues as per the if part, otherwise, the function ends the block with the same conditions as before the if statement.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(pos + 1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `pos + 1` to `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was in the range `[pos + 1, n]`.
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must still be within this range in the next iteration.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` must be within the range `[pos + 1, n]` for the loop to continue, and it must also satisfy the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)` if it continues.
   - `pos` must remain the same because the loop starts from `pos + 1`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` must be the next value in the sequence, starting from the previous `i` and moving towards `n`.
   - If `i` satisfies the condition, it will increment to the next value in the range; otherwise, the loop will end.

5. **New State:**
   - `results` will contain the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines.
   - `per` remains unchanged.
   - `pos` remains unchanged.
   - `t` must remain greater than 0.
   - `index` remains unchanged.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `ans` will contain all valid triplets generated up to the current `n-1`.
   - `ost` will contain the new value of `i`.
   - `n` remains the same.
   - `i` will be the next value in the sequence, starting from the previous `i` and moving towards `n`.
   - The condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)` must be satisfied for the loop to continue.

Given these points, the new state can be described as follows:

State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` remains unchanged, `t` remains greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` contains all valid triplets generated up to the current `n-1`, `ost` contains the next value of `i` in the sequence, `n` remains the same, and `i` will be the next value in the sequence, starting from the previous `i` and moving towards `n` if it satisfies the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)`**.
