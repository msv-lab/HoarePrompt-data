The code `per = n - 3` assigns the value of `n - 3` to the variable `per`. Since the initial value of `(n - 3) % 4` is 2, the new value of `per` will also satisfy `(per - 3) % 4 == 2`. The value of `n` and the contents of the `pos` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`pos` is an integer list that contains all integers `i` in the range `[pos[-1] + 1, n]` such that `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`; `per` is `n - 3`; the condition `(n - 1) % 4 != 2` holds true; the current value of `(n - 3) % 4` is 2.**
