The code appends a new element to the list `results`. This new element is a string created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces, where `x` is the next element in `ans`. Since the exact values of `x` and `ans` are not specified, we will keep them in their general form.

The initial state is:
- `results` is a list containing the original elements plus a new string created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces.
- `x` is the next element in `ans`.

After the code runs, `results` will have its original contents plus the new string created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces. The value of `x` is updated to be the next element in `ans`.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the original elements plus the string created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces; `x` is the next element in `ans`.**
