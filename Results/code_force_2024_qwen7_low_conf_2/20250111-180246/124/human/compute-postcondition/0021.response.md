The `continue` statement is used in loops to skip the rest of the current iteration and move on to the next iteration. However, the given code snippet does not contain a loop, so the `continue` statement has no effect and does not change any variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer derived from `data[0]`, `data` is a list of strings with at least one element, `n` is an integer derived from `data[2]`, `ans1` is [8], `ans2` is [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]], `index` is 2, `results` is ['1', '2 6 8', '3 5 7'], `ans` is [[[2, 6, 8], [3, 5, 7]]]**
