Output State: **`results` is a list that contains the string representation of each triplet in `ans` formatted as `' '.join(map(str, x))`, `x` is unchanged, `ans` must be empty.**

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each triplet `x` in the list `ans` and appends its string representation to the `results` list.
   - This means that for every iteration, the loop takes a triplet from `ans` and converts it into a string using `' '.join(map(str, x))`.

2. **State After Each Iteration:**
   - After the loop executes 1 time, `results` contains the string representation of the first triplet in `ans`.
   - After the loop executes 2 times, `results` contains the string representations of the first two triplets in `ans`.
   - After the loop executes 3 times, `results` contains the string representations of the first three triplets in `ans`.

3. **Final State:**
   - The loop will continue to append string representations of triplets from `ans` until `ans` is empty.
   - Once `ans` becomes empty, the loop terminates because there are no more triplets left to process.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - By the end of all iterations, `results` will contain the string representations of all triplets originally in `ans`.
   - `x` remains unchanged throughout the loop since it is only used within the loop body and does not affect the overall state outside the loop.
   - `ans` must be empty when the loop completes, as all triplets have been processed and added to `results`.

Thus, the final output state after all iterations of the loop is that `results` contains the string representations of all triplets in `ans`, `x` is unchanged, and `ans` is empty.
