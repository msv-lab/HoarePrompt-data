The code initializes an empty list `ost`. No other operations are performed, so the values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `ost` list.

Output State: **`index` is increased by 1; `ans` is an empty list; `results` is a list containing the string representations of all elements in `ans`; `ans1` is a list containing valid elements; `ans2` is a list containing valid elements; `data[index-1]` is an existing and integer value; `t` is greater than 0; `pos` is 0; `ost` is an empty list.**
