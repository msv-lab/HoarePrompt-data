Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as:
   - `i` is `i_{\text{prev}} - 24`
   - `ost` contains `i_{\text{prev}} - 24` if `i_{\text{prev}} - 24 > 8`, otherwise `ost` contains `ans` (which is unchanged).

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   ans.append([i, i - 4, i - 8])
   ```

3. This code appends a list containing three elements to the `ans` list:
   - The first element is `i`
   - The second element is `i - 4`
   - The third element is `i - 8`

4. The values of `i` and `ost` remain unchanged from their initial state because no direct assignment or modification is done to these variables.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `i` is `i_{\text{prev}} - 24`
- `ost` contains `i_{\text{prev}} - 24` if `i_{\text{prev}} - 24 > 8`, otherwise `ost` contains `ans` (unchanged)
- `ans` now includes the new list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`

Output State: **`i` is `i_{\text{prev}} - 24`; `ost` contains `i_{\text{prev}} - 24` if `i_{\text{prev}} - 24 > 8`, otherwise `ost` contains `ans`; `ans` includes the new list `[i, i - 4, i - 8]`**
