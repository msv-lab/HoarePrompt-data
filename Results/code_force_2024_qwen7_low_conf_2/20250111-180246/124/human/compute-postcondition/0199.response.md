`results` is a list that includes the string created by `' '.join(map(str, x))`, and `x` is unchanged. The code appends the string created by `' '.join(map(str, x))` to the list `results`. Therefore, the new value of `results` will be a list containing its original elements plus the newly created string.

Output State: **`results` is [' '.join(map(str, x))] (if it was initially empty), or [' '.join(map(str, x))] plus the original elements, `x` is unchanged, `ans` must have at least one element remaining**
