Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 4 and less than 18, `i` is 7, `ans` is `[3, 4, 5, [7, 8, 9]]`, and `pos` is 9. This is because if `i > n // 2 - 2`, then `n` must satisfy the condition to update `ans` to include `[7, 8, 9]` and `pos` to 9. Since there is no else part, no other changes occur if the condition is not met.**
