The code appends a string to the list `results`. The string is created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces, and each element is converted to a string using `map(str, x)`. Since the exact values of `x` are not specified, we will represent them generally.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The code `results.append(' '.join(map(str, x)))` will append a new string to the list `results`.
2. This new string is created by joining the elements of `x` (which are assumed to be strings due to the `map(str, x)` part) with spaces.
3. The value of `results` is updated to include this new string.

Given that the exact values of `x` are not specified, we cannot provide specific numerical values for the new string. However, we know that the new string is formed by joining the elements of `x` with spaces.

Therefore, the Output State is:
Output State: **`results` is a list containing the original elements plus a new string created by joining the elements of `x` with spaces**.
