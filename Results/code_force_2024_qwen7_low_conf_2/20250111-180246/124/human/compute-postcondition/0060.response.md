Postcondition: ***`pos` is an integer list that contains all integers `i` in the range `[pos[-1] + 1, n]` such that `(i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2`. `per` is either `n` or `n - 3`, depending on whether the condition `(n - 3) % 4 == 2` holds. The condition `(n - 1) % 4 != 2` remains true.***
