The code appends the current value of `i` to the list `ost`. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the next line and the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)` must be satisfied for the loop to continue, the value of `i` is now `i + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` will contain the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, `per` remains unchanged, `pos` remains unchanged, `t` must remain greater than 0, `index` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `ans` will contain all valid triplets generated up to the new `n-1`, `ost` contains the previous value of `ost` plus the new value of `i + 1`, `n` remains the same, `i` is incremented by 1, and the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)` must be satisfied for the loop to continue.**
