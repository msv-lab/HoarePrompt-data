Let's analyze the given task step by step:

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `ost` is a string.
- `ans` must have at least one element.
- `results` is a list containing two elements:
  - The first element is at least 1.
  - The second element is the string formed by joining the elements of the next `x` in `ans` with a space.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for x in ans:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each element in `ans`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `ans` must have at least one element.
2. **Impact on Variables**:
   - Each iteration of the loop processes one element from `ans` and updates the `results` list.
   - After processing `x`, `results` is updated to contain the first element (which remains at least 1) and the second element, which is now the string formed by joining the elements of `x` (converted to strings) with a space.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- Since `ans` must have at least one element for the loop to continue, and we are moving to the next iteration, `ans` must have at least two elements.
- The first element of `results` remains unchanged and is still at least 1.
- The second element of `results` is updated to be the string formed by joining the elements of the next `x` in `ans` with a space.

### Updated State:
- `ost` is a string.
- `ans` must have at least two elements.
- `results` is a list containing two elements:
  - The first element is at least 1.
  - The second element is the string formed by joining the elements of the next `x` in `ans` (the first element that was not processed yet) with a space.

### Final Answer:
**`ost` is a string, `ans` must have at least two elements, `results` is a list containing the first element as at least 1, and the second element as the joined string of the elements in `x` (converted to strings) separated by a space.**
