The code appends the string representation of the length of `ans` to the `results` list. This means that `results` will have one additional element which is the length of `ans`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing the string representation of each valid triplet in `ans` joined by newlines, with an additional element representing the length of `ans`; `per`, `pos`, `t`, `index`, `data`, and `n` remain unchanged; `ans` contains all valid triplets including possibly `[9, 5, 1]`; `ost` contains values of `i` that satisfy or do not satisfy the condition `((i % 2 != 0 or i % 4 == 0) and i > n // 2)` until the loop terminates; if the length of `ost` is 1, the function continues with `ost[0]` and does not add any new triplets to `ans`; if the length of `ost` is 2, `ans` includes the triplet `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]` and `i` is the largest value of `i` that was greater than `n // 2` and did not satisfy the condition; if the length of `ost` is 3 or 4, `ans` includes the triplets `[1, ost[1], ost[0]]` and `[2, ost[2], ost[3]]`, and `i` is either the largest value of `i` that was greater than `n // 2` and did not satisfy the condition or `n` if no such value exists.**
