Reasoning:
1. **Function and Input Handling**: The function correctly reads input from standard input and processes multiple test cases. It correctly handles the constraints for the number of test cases and the value of \(n\).
2. **Predefined Triplets**: The function checks if the current \(n\) is in a predefined list `ans1`. If so, it retrieves and outputs the corresponding triplets from `ans2`. This part is correctly implemented and adheres to the problem's requirements.
3. **Dynamic Triplet Generation**: For \(n\) not in `ans1`, the function generates triplets dynamically based on specific rules involving arithmetic progressions and modulo operations. These rules ensure that the number of operations does not exceed \(\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5\).
4. **GCD Verification**: The generated triplets are designed to ensure that after applying them, all numbers from 1 to \(n\) will appear in the set of GCDs of all subsequences with a size greater than 1. The provided example and the logic within the function support this claim.
5. **Output Formatting**: The function formats the output correctly, including the number of operations and the triplet descriptions.

Given the above points, the function appears to meet the requirements of the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
