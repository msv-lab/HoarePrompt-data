Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided solution does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the solution seems to rely on a fixed pattern of operations that may not work for all values of `n`. For instance, the approach used to handle different residue classes modulo 4 and the handling of leftover elements might not guarantee that all numbers from 1 to `n` will appear in the set of GCDs of all subsequences with a size greater than 1.

To illustrate, consider the case where `n = 9`. The solution generates operations based on a pattern that might not ensure that all numbers from 1 to 9 are covered. Here is a specific counterexample:

For `n = 9`, the generated operations are:
```
3
3 5 7
5 6 7
2 3 4
```
This results in the following array after operations:
```
a = [1, 2, 35, 4, 30, 105, 42, 8, 140]
```
Checking the GCDs of all subsequences with a size greater than 1:
- \(\gcd(1, 2) = 1\)
- \(\gcd(35, 4) = 1\)
- \(\gcd(4, 30) = 2\)
- \(\gcd(30, 105) = 15\)
- \(\gcd(105, 42) = 21\)
- \(\gcd(42, 8) = 2\)
- \(\gcd(8, 140) = 4\)
- \(\gcd(140, 35) = 35\)

The GCD set does not include 3, 6, 7, which are required according to the problem description.

Therefore, the program is not correct as it fails to meet the requirements for certain values of `n`.
