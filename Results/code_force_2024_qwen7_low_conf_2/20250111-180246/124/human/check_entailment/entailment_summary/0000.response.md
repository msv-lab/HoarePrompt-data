Reasoning:
The provided program attempts to generate a sequence of operations that meet the specified requirements. Here are the key points to consider:

1. **Predefined Values Handling**: The program checks if the value of \( n \) is in a predefined list (`ans1`). If so, it retrieves precomputed triplets from another list (`ans2`) and uses them directly. This approach ensures that for known values of \( n \), the correct operations are immediately available without further computation.

2. **Custom Computation for Unknown \( n \)**: For values of \( n \) not in `ans1`, the program computes the operations based on a set of rules involving arithmetic progressions and modulo operations. Specifically:
   - It selects triplets based on specific ranges and conditions.
   - It handles edge cases where the number of remaining elements is small (e.g., 1, 2, 3, or 4).

3. **Output Formatting**: The program outputs the number of operations followed by the triplets, ensuring the output format matches the expected output specification.

4. **Constraints Compliance**: The program ensures that the operations do not violate the constraints (\( a_i \leq 10^{18} \)) and correctly handles the requirement to produce all numbers from 1 to \( n \) in the GCD set of subsequences.

Given the problem statement and the provided execution summary, the program appears to follow the necessary steps to generate valid operations for any \( n \) within the given range. The predefined handling for known values and the custom computation for unknown values ensure that the solution is robust and adheres to the constraints.

Correctness: **True**
