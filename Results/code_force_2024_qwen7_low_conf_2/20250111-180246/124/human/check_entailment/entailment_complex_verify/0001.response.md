### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The task is to verify if the provided program generates a sequence of operations that meets the criteria specified in the problem statement.
   - Key points include handling multiple test cases, ensuring the sequence of operations does not exceed \(\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5\), and verifying that the GCDs of all subsequences cover all numbers from 1 to \(n\).

2. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` reads input and processes it.
   - Predefined solutions for \(n = 8\) are handled separately.
   - For other values of \(n\), the function constructs sequences of operations based on specific patterns and ensures the constraints are met.

3. **Key Observations**:
   - The function uses precomputed answers for small values of \(n\) (specifically \(n = 8\)) and predefined sequences of operations for these cases.
   - For other values of \(n\), the function constructs sequences of operations based on specific arithmetic progressions and modulo operations.
   - The logic ensures that the operations are constructed in such a way that the resulting array meets the constraints and the GCD requirement.

4. **Specific Issues**:
   - **Predefined Solutions**: The function handles \(n = 8\) correctly by providing the exact sequences \([2, 6, 8]\) and \([3, 5, 7]\).
   - **General Case Logic**: The general case logic constructs sequences based on the remainder when \(n-1\), \(n-2\), or \(n-3\) is divided by 4. This ensures that the constructed sequences will cover all numbers from 1 to \(n\).
   - **Constraints Compliance**: The function ensures that the number of operations does not exceed \(\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5\) and that the values in the array do not exceed \(10^{18}\).

5. **Validation**:
   - The provided examples in the problem description confirm that the function works correctly for various values of \(n\).
   - The logical structure and constraints compliance suggest that the function is robust and covers all necessary cases.

### Conclusion:
- The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the required logic and meets the problem's specifications.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**

The given program is correct.
