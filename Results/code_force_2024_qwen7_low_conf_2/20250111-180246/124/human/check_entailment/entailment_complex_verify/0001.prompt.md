You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Given an integer n , you construct an array a of n integers, where a_i = i for
all integers i in the range [1, n] . An operation on this array is defined as
follows:

  * Select three distinct indices i , j , and k from the array, and let x = a_i , y = a_j , and z = a_k . 
  * Update the array as follows: a_i = \operatorname{lcm}(y, z) , a_j = \operatorname{lcm}(x, z) , and a_k = \operatorname{lcm}(x, y) , where \operatorname{lcm} represents the least common multiple. 

Your task is to provide a possible sequence of operations, containing at most
\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5 operations such that after executing these
operations, if you create a set containing the greatest common divisors (GCDs)
of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 , then all numbers from 1 to n
should be present in this set.

After all the operations a_i \le 10^{18} should hold for all 1 \le i \le n .

We can show that an answer always exists.

Input

The first line contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 10^2 ) — the number of test
cases. The description of the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains an integer n (3 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^{4} ) — the length of the array.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^{4} .

Output

The first line should contain an integer k (0 \leq k \leq \lfloor \frac{n}{6}
\rfloor + 5 ) — where k is the number of operations.

The next k lines should contain the description of each operation i.e. 3
integers i , j and k , where 1 \leq i, j, k \leq n and all must be distinct.

Example

Input

    3
    
    3
    
    4
    
    7

Output

    1
    1 2 3
    1
    1 3 4
    3
    3 5 7
    5 6 7
    2 3 4

Note

In the third test case, a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7] .

First operation:

i = 3 , j = 5 , k = 7

x = 3 , y = 5 , z = 7 .

a = [1, 2, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), 4, \operatorname{lcm}(x,z), 6,
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)] = [1, 2, \color{red}{35}, 4, \color{red}{21}, 6,
\color{red}{15}] .

Second operation:

i = 5 , j = 6 , k = 7

x = 21 , y = 6 , z = 15 .

a = [1, 2, 35, 4, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), \operatorname{lcm}(x,z),
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y)] = [1, 2, 35, 4, \color{red}{30}, \color{red}{105},
\color{red}{42}] .

Third operation:

i = 2 , j = 3 , k = 4

x = 2 , y = 35 , z = 4 .

a = [1, \operatorname{lcm}(y,z), \operatorname{lcm}(x,z),
\operatorname{lcm}(x,y), 30, 105, 42] = [1, \color{red}{140}, \color{red}{4},
\color{red}{70}, 30, 105, 42] .

Subsequences whose GCD equal to i is as follows:

\gcd(a_1, a_2) = \gcd(1, 140) = 1

\gcd(a_3, a_4) = \gcd(4, 70) = 2

\gcd(a_5, a_6, a_7) = \gcd(30, 105, 42) = 3

\gcd(a_2, a_3) = \gcd(140, 4) = 4

\gcd(a_2, a_4, a_5, a_6) = \gcd(140, 70, 30, 105) = 5

\gcd(a_5, a_7) = \gcd(30, 42) = 6

\gcd(a_2, a_4, a_6, a_7) = \gcd(140, 70, 105, 42) = 7

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `ans` is a list of valid triplets generated based on the values of `n` in `data`, `per` and `pos` retain their last computed values, `results` is a list containing the number of valid triplets followed by the triplets themselves.
    sys.stdout.write('\n'.join(results) + '\n')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases where each test case involves an integer \(n\) such that \(3 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\). For each \(n\), the function generates valid triplets based on certain conditions and appends these triplets to a result list. If \(n\) is found in a predefined list `ans1`, it retrieves precomputed triplets from `ans2`. Otherwise, it computes the triplets according to specific rules involving arithmetic progressions and modulo operations. The function then outputs the number of generated triplets followed by the triplets themselves, formatted as a series of lines in the standard output. The function handles edge cases where \(n\) might not fit into the predefined list and ensures that the output adheres to the constraints specified.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to verify if the provided program generates a sequence of operations that meets the criteria specified in the problem statement.
2. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The program should handle multiple test cases correctly.
   - For each test case, the program should output a sequence of at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5\) operations.
   - After performing the operations, the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 should cover all numbers from 1 to \(n\).
   - The values in the array should not exceed \(10^{18}\) after the operations.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it.
   - It uses precomputed answers for small values of \(n\) (specifically \(n = 8\)) and predefined sequences of operations for these cases.
   - For other values of \(n\), it constructs sequences of operations based on specific patterns and ensures that the constraints are met.
   - The logic for constructing sequences seems to follow a pattern based on the remainder when \(n-1\), \(n-2\), or \(n-3\) is divided by 4, which suggests a methodical approach to ensuring the desired properties.

4. **Verification**:
   - The program handles edge cases like \(n = 8\) directly and provides a predefined solution.
   - For other values, the construction of operations appears to follow a structured pattern that should theoretically meet the problem's requirements.
   - The constraints on the number of operations and the maximum value in the array are respected within the logic provided.

Based on the analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the required logic and meets the problem's specifications.
