Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The task is to verify if the provided program generates a sequence of operations that meets the criteria specified in the problem statement.
2. **Key Points to Verify**:
   - The program should handle multiple test cases correctly.
   - For each test case, the program should output a sequence of at most \(\lfloor \frac{n}{6} \rfloor + 5\) operations.
   - After performing the operations, the greatest common divisors (GCDs) of all subsequences with a size greater than 1 should cover all numbers from 1 to \(n\).
   - The values in the array should not exceed \(10^{18}\) after the operations.

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it.
   - It uses precomputed answers for small values of \(n\) (specifically \(n = 8\)) and predefined sequences of operations for these cases.
   - For other values of \(n\), it constructs sequences of operations based on specific patterns and ensures that the constraints are met.
   - The logic for constructing sequences seems to follow a pattern based on the remainder when \(n-1\), \(n-2\), or \(n-3\) is divided by 4, which suggests a methodical approach to ensuring the desired properties.

4. **Verification**:
   - The program handles edge cases like \(n = 8\) directly and provides a predefined solution.
   - For other values, the construction of operations appears to follow a structured pattern that should theoretically meet the problem's requirements.
   - The constraints on the number of operations and the maximum value in the array are respected within the logic provided.

Based on the analysis, the program seems to correctly implement the required logic and meets the problem's specifications.

Correctness: **True**
