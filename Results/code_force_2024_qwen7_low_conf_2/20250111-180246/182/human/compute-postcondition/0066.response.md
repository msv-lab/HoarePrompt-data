The code `length += 1` increments the value of `length` by 1. The initial state specifies that `n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1, and `length` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` does not equal '0'. However, since the condition `a[i] != '0'` is not checked here, only the value of `length` is updated. Therefore, the value of `length` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1, `length` is increased by 1, `b_count[1]` remains unchanged**
