The code snippet `length += 1` increments the value of `length` by 1. Since `length` was increased by 1 if `a[i]` did not equal '0' before this line, it will now be increased again regardless of the condition. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `a` is a list, `length` is increased by 1, `b_count[0]` is unchanged, `b_count[1]` is unchanged**
