`length` is incremented by 1, which means `length` now holds the value of its previous value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t`, `length` is `length + 1`, `b_count[0]` is the count of '0's in `b`, `b_count[1]` is the count of '1's in `b`.**
