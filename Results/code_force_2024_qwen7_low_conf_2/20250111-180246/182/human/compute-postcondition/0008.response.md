`k` is incremented by 1 if the condition `x == a[k]` evaluates to `True`. Otherwise, `k` remains unchanged. Since the exact values of `x`, `a[k]`, and the initial value of `k` are not specified, we can only express the updated value of `k` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`k` is either `k + 1` if `x == a[k]` is `True`, or `k` if `x == a[k]` is `False`; the value of `a[k]` and `x` remain unchanged.**
