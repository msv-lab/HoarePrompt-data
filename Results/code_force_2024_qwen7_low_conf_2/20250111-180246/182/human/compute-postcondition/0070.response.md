The code `length += 1` increments the value of `length` by 1. Since `length` was previously increased by 1 if `a[i]` does not equal '0', the new value of `length` will be the current value plus 1. The values of `n`, `a`, `i`, and `b_count[1]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1, `length` is increased by 1, `b_count[1]` remains unchanged**
