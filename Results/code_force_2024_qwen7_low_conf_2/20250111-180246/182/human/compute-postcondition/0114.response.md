`b_count[1]` is decremented by 1. The value of `b_count[1]` was previously the same as before, so now it is one less than its previous value. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t + 1`, `b_count[0]` is the same as before, `b_count[1]` is one less than its previous value, `length` is greater than 1**
