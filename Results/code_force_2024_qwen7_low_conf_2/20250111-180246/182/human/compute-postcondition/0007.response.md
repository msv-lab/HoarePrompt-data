Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is `value*`
   - `k` is 0 if `x` is not equal to `value*`, or `k` is 1 if `x` is equal to `value*`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for x in I():
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over values from the iterator `I()`.
   - For each value `x` in `I()`, the loop body runs.

4. **Determining the Next State:**
   - To determine the next state, we need to consider what happens to the variables `a` and `k` after the loop body is executed for the current value of `x`.

5. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `x` is not equal to `value*`, then `k` remains 0.
   - If `x` is equal to `value*`, then `k` becomes 1.

6. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next value `x` from the iterator `I()` must be considered.
   - Since the loop condition does not depend on `a`, `a` remains unchanged.
   - `k` will be 0 if the next `x` is not equal to `value*`, or `k` will be 1 if the next `x` is equal to `value*`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
- `a` is still `value*`
- `k` is 0 if the next `x` is not equal to `value*`, or `k` is 1 if the next `x` is equal to `value*`

**Final State:**
State: **`a` is `value*`, `k` is 0 if the next `x` is not equal to `value*`, or `k` is 1 if the next `x` is equal to `value*`**
