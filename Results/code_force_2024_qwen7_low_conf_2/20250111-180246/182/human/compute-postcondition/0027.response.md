The initial state provided seems to have a self-referential assignment `k` is `k + 1`, which is unusual and not typical. However, for the sake of this exercise, let's assume that the initial value of `k` was such that after the operation `k` is incremented by 1. Also, `k` is printed in the initial state.

Given the code snippet:
```
a = I() + '*'
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code:
- `a` is assigned the value of `I() + '*'`. Here, `I()` is a function call, but its exact behavior (what it returns) is not specified.
- The values of `k` and the print statement do not directly affect `a` since they are separate operations.

Since `I()` is called and concatenated with '*', the value of `a` will be whatever `I()` returns followed by '*'.

Output State: **`k` is `k + 1`, `k` is printed, `a` is `I()` + '*'**
