Postcondition: ***`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t + 2`. If `a[i]` is '0' and `b_count[0]` is true, then `length` is increased by 1 and `b_count[0]` is decreased by 1. If `a[i]` is '0' and `b_count[1]` is true, then `b_count[1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
