Postcondition: ***`a` is a string from the first input, `b` is a string from the second input, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer from input, `i` is `t`, `length` is either 0 or 1, `b_count[0]` is the count of '0's in `b`, and `b_count[1]` is the count of '1's in `b`. If `b_count[0]` is true, `length` becomes 1 and `b_count[0]` decreases by 1. Otherwise, `length` remains 0 and `b_count[0]` remains unchanged, with `a[i]` still being '0'.***
