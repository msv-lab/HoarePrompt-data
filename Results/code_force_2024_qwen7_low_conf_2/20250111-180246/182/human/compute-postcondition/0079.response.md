Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `a` is a list, `length` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is not '0'. If `b_count[0]` is true, `b_count[0]` is decreased by 1; otherwise, `b_count[1]` is decreased by 1. If neither `b_count[0]` nor `b_count[1]` is true, `length` is still increased by 1 if `a[i]` is not '0'.***
