`n` and `m` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `n` and `m` will be integers. The number of iterations remaining is reduced by 1 because one iteration has been processed. Therefore, the output state is: `t-2` iterations remaining; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input.

Output State: **`t-2` iterations remaining; `n` is an integer from the input; `m` is an integer from the input**
