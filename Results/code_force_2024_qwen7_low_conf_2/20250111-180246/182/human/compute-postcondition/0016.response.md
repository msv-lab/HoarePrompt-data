The code `k = 0` assigns the value 0 to `k`. Since `k` was previously set to the number of remaining iterations returned by `I()`, this value is now overwritten. The initial state also mentions that `k` is printed, which means that before the assignment, `k` held the value returned by `I()`. After the assignment, `k` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is `I() + '*'`, `k` is 0**
