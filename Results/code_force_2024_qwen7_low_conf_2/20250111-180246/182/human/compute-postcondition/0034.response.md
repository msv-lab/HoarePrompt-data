`k` is incremented by 1 if `x == a[k]` is `True`. Since the exact value of `a[k]` and `x` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `k` after the operation. However, we know that `k` was initially 2, 1, or 0.

Let's consider the three possible initial values of `k`:

1. If `k` was 2:
   - `x == a[2]` could be `True` or `False`.
   - If `True`, `k` becomes 3.
   - If `False`, `k` remains 2.

2. If `k` was 1:
   - `x == a[1]` could be `True` or `False`.
   - If `True`, `k` becomes 2.
   - If `False`, `k` remains 1.

3. If `k` was 0:
   - `x == a[0]` could be `True` or `False`.
   - If `True`, `k` becomes 1.
   - If `False`, `k` remains 0.

Therefore, the possible values of `k` after the operation are 1, 2, or 3, depending on the value of `x` and `a[k]`.

Output State: **`k` is either 1, 2, or 3**
