Postcondition: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t + 1`. If `a[i]` is '0' and `b_count[0]` is true, then `b_count[0]` is reduced by 1 and `length` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is '0' and `b_count[1]` is true, then `b_count[1]` is decremented by 1 and `length` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b_count[0]`, `b_count[1]`, and `length` remain unchanged. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
