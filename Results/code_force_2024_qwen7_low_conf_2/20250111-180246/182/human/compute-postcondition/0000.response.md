The code `I = input` assigns the function `input` to the variable `I`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, or `b`. The precondition remains unchanged.

Output State: **t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; a is a binary string of length n; b is a binary string of length m; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; similarly, the sum of all m values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; `I` is now a reference to the `input` function.**
