`b_count[0]` is decremented by 1. The value of `n`, `m`, `i`, `b_count[1]`, and `length` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t + 1`, `b_count[0]` is the value of its original value minus 1, `b_count[1]` is the same as before, `length` is `length + 1`.
