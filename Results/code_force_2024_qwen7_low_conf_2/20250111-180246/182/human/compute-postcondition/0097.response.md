Postcondition: ***`a` is a string from the first input, `b` is a string from the second input, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an integer from input, `i` is `t`, `length` is 0, `b_count[0]` is the count of '0's in `b`, `b_count[1]` is the count of '1's in `b`. The current value of `a[i]` is '0', and `b_count[0]` is false.***
