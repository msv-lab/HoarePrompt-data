`length` is incremented by 1. The value of `length` was not specified in the initial state, but it is now increased by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t + 2`, `length` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t + 2`, `length` is increased by 1**
