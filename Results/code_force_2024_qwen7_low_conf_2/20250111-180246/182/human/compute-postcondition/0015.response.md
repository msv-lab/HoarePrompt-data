The code assigns the value returned by `I()` plus the string `'*'` to the variable `a`. The previous value of `a` is `value*`, and `k` is the number of remaining iterations returned by `I()`. After executing the code, the value of `a` changes to the value returned by `I()` plus `'*'`. The value of `k` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is `I() + '*'`, `k` is the number of remaining iterations returned by `I()`, and `k` is printed**
