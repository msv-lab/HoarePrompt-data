`length` is incremented by 1. The values of `n`, `a[i]`, and `b_count[0]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `a[i]` is '0', and `b_count[0]` is true; `length` is 1 more than its previous value.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, the current value of `a[i]` is '0', and `b_count[0]` is true; `length` is 1 more than its previous value.**
