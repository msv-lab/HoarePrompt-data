Postcondition: ***`n` must still be greater than the new `i + 1`, which is either `(i + 2)` or `(i + 1) + 1` depending on the condition. `a` remains the same. If `b_count[1]` is true, `length` is increased by 1 and `b_count[1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `length` retains its previous value and we break out of the most internal loop or block of code.***
