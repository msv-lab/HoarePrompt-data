Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1, `length` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` does not equal '0'. If `b_count[0]` is true, `b_count[0]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `b_count[1]` remains unchanged. If `b_count[1]` is true, `b_count[1]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `length` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` does not equal '0'.***
