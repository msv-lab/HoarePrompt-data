The initial state mentions that `k` is `k + 1` and `k` is printed, and `a` is `I()` + '*'. However, the actual value of `k` before the assignment `k = 0` is not specified. Let's assume the value of `k` before this assignment is `k0`. The code `k = 0` assigns the value `0` to `k`.

After the code execution, `k` is now `0`, and the value of `a` remains unchanged as the assignment to `k` does not affect `a`. Therefore, `a` is still `I()` + '*'.

Output State: **`k` is 0; `a` is `I()` + '*'**
