The code `print(k)` simply prints the value of `k`. Since the value of `k` does not change when this line of code is executed, the only thing that happens is that the current value of `k` is printed. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is `value*`, `k` is the index where `x == a[k]` was found, or `k` is equal to the length of `a` if no such index exists, and `k` is printed**
