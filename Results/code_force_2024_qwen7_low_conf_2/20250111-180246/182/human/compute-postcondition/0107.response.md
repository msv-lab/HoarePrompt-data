Postcondition: ***`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t`. If `b_count[0]` is True, then `length` becomes 1, `b_count[0]` decreases by 1, and `a[i]` is '0'. If `b_count[1]` is True, `length` increments by 1, `b_count[1]` decreases by 1, and `a[i]` remains '0'. If both `b_count[0]` and `b_count[1]` are False, `length` remains 0 and `a[i]` is '0'.***
