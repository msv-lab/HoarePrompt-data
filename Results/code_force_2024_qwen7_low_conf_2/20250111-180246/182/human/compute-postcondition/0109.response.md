`length` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `length` is now `length + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t + 1`, `b_count[0]` is the same as before, `b_count[1` is the same as before, `length` is `length + 1**
