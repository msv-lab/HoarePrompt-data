The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, the function seems to operate over several implicit inputs: `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b`.

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). This indicates the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n` and `m` are integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). These represent the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b` respectively.
- `a` and `b` are binary strings of lengths `n` and `m` respectively.

The function's output depends on the processing of these inputs, but the specific output format is not provided in the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts implicit parameters `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, and `b` where `t` is the number of test cases, and for each test case, `n` and `m` are the lengths of binary strings `a` and `b` respectively. The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given constraints.**
