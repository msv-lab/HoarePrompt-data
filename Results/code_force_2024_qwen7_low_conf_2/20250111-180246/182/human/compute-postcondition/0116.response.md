Postcondition: ***`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t + 1`. If `b_count[1]` is true, then `b_count[1]` is one less than its previous value and `length` is greater than 1. Otherwise, `b_count[1]` remains unchanged and `length` remains the same. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
