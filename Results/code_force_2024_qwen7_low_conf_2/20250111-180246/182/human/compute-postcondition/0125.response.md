The code `break` does not affect any variable values and only breaks out of the nearest loop or match case. Since there is no loop or match case in the given code, it simply exits the context it was in, which could be an implicit loop or conditional structure. However, since the initial state includes variables `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `i` and none of these are modified or part of a structure that would be exited by `break`, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t + 2`**
