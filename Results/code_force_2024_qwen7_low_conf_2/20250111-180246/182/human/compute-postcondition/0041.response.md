Postcondition: ***`n` must still be greater than the new `i + 1`, which is either `(i + 2)` or `(i + 1) + 1` depending on the condition. `a` remains the same. `length` is updated as follows: 
- If `a[i] == '0'`, then `n > (i + 2)`, `length` is now `length + 1`, and `b_count[0]` is decreased by 1 if `b_count[0]` is true.
- If `a[i] != '0'`, then `n > (i + 1) + 1` (or `n > (i + 2)` if `b_count[0]` is false), `length` is increased by 1 if `b_count[1]` is true and decreased by 1, otherwise `length` retains its previous value, and the most internal loop or block of code is exited.***
