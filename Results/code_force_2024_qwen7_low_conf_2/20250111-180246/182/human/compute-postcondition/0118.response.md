According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop runs as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `a` is a string
- `b` is a string
- `n` is greater than 0
- `m` is an integer
- `i` is `t + 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` was `t + 1` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to increase `i` by 1 to `t + 2` for the next iteration.

Therefore, the new state should reflect that `i` is now `t + 2`, and `n` remains the same since there is no information suggesting `n` changes within the loop body.

State: **`a` is a string, `b` is a string, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer, `i` is `t + 2`**
