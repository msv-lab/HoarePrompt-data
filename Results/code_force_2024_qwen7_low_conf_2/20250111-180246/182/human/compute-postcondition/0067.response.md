`b_count[0]` is decremented by 1. The value of `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1, `length` is increased by 1, and `b_count[1]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are: `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1, `length` is increased by 1, `b_count[0]` is decreased by 1, and `b_count[1]` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list, `i` is incremented by 1, `length` is increased by 1, `b_count[0]` is decreased by 1, `b_count[1]` remains unchanged**
