You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Output

Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program: 
def func():
    I = input
    for _ in [0] * int(I()):
        I()
        a = I() + '*'
        k = 0
        for x in I():
            k += x == a[k]
        print(k)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5; a is a binary string of length n; b is a binary string of length m; the sum of all n values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5; similarly, the sum of all m values across all test cases does not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
def func():
    I = input
    for _ in [0] * int(I()):
        I()
        
        a = I() + '*'
        
        k = 0
        
        for x in I():
            k += x == a[k]
        
        print(k)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` is a binary string followed by '*', `k` is the number of times the character at the current index in `I()` matches the character at the same index in `a` (considering `a` is a binary string), `I()` must produce at least as many elements as the final value of `k`, and the final value of `k` is printed.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
The given program attempts to solve the problem by iterating through the characters of the string `b` and comparing them with the corresponding characters in the string `a`. However, there are a few issues with the logic:

1. The program uses `I()` (which is assumed to be `input`) to read the number of test cases, but it then immediately reads and discards an unnecessary line (`I()`), which does not conform to the problem statement.
2. The program appends a special character `'*'` to the end of the string `a`. This is unnecessary and incorrect because it affects the comparison process.
3. The comparison logic `k += x == a[k]` is flawed. It assumes that `a[k]` will always be a character from the string `a`, but this is not true when `k` is greater than the length of `a`. This can lead to out-of-bounds errors and incorrect results.
4. The program does not handle the length constraints of the input strings properly, which could lead to potential bugs or errors if the lengths exceed certain limits.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum prefix of `a` that is a subsequence of `b`.
