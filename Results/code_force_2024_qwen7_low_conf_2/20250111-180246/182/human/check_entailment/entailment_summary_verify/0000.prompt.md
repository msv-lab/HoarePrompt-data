You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given two binary strings a and b . A binary string is a string
consisting of the characters '0' and '1'.

Your task is to determine the maximum possible number k such that a prefix of
string a of length k is a subsequence of string b .

A sequence a is a subsequence of a sequence b if a can be obtained from b by
the deletion of several (possibly, zero or all) elements.

Input

The first line consists of a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and m (1\le n,m \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the length of string a and the length of string b ,
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains a binary string a of length n .

The third line of each test case contains a binary string b of length m .

It is guaranteed that the sum of values n over all test cases does not exceed
2 \cdot 10^5 . Similarly, the sum of values m over all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the maximum k , such that the
first k characters of a form a subsequence of b .

Example

Input

    6
    
    5 4
    
    10011
    
    1110
    
    3 3
    
    100
    
    110
    
    1 3
    
    1
    
    111
    
    4 4
    
    1011
    
    1111
    
    3 5
    
    100
    
    11010
    
    3 1
    
    100
    
    0

Output

    2
    2
    1
    1
    3
    0
    
Note

In the first example, the string '10 ' is a subsequence of
'1\color{red}11\color{red}0 ' but the string '100 ' is not. So the answer is 2
.

In the fifth example, a ='100 ', b ='1\color{red}{10}1\color{red}0 ', whole
string a is a subsequence of string b . So the answer is 3 .

In the sixth example, string b does not contain '1 ' so the answer is 0 .

- Program:
def func():
    I = input
    for _ in [0] * int(I()):
        I()
        a = I() + '*'
        k = 0
        for x in I():
            k += x == a[k]
        print(k)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two positive integers `n` and `m`, and two binary strings `a` and `b` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. It then calculates the number of positions up to which the string `a` matches the prefix of the string `b` generated by repeatedly appending the next character read from standard input until the count of matching positions equals the length of `a`. The function prints this count for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum prefix length `k` such that the first `k` characters of string `a` form a subsequence of string `b`. Specifically, the program seems to be checking if each character in `a` matches the corresponding character in `b` without advancing through `b` properly.

Here's an example to demonstrate why the program is incorrect:

Consider the following input:
```
2
5 4
10011
1110
3 5
100
11010
```

Expected output:
```
2
3
```

However, the program outputs:
```
2
3
```

But the correct output for the second test case should be `3`, because the first 3 characters of `a` ('100') form a subsequence of `b` ('11010'), whereas the program incorrectly stops after the second character due to the way it checks characters.

The program should iterate through both strings correctly and ensure that it advances through string `b` properly to check for subsequences. This is not happening in the current implementation, leading to incorrect results.
