The function `func_2` accepts two parameters: `x`, a positive integer, and `mod`, which is set to \(10^9 + 7\). It returns the result of \(x^{1000000005} \mod 1000000007\). There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the provided code. The function correctly implements the intended mathematical operation using the `pow` function with three arguments: the base (`x`), the exponent (`1000000005`), and the modulus (`1000000007`). After executing, the program state will be such that the function returns the computed value, ensuring that the result is within the range of 0 to \(1000000006\).
