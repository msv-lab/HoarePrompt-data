The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a board size `n`, the number of rook moves `k`, and `k` pairs of row and column indices representing the moves. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of moves required to place `k` non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks can attack each other either horizontally or vertically. It then computes the factorial of this minimum number of moves (`m`) modulo a constant `MOD` and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result from the list.
