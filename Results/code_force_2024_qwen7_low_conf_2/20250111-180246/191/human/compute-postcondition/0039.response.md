Postcondition: ***`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `rows` contains the values `r` and `c`, `cols` contains the value `r`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, `rows` will also contain the value of `c`.***
