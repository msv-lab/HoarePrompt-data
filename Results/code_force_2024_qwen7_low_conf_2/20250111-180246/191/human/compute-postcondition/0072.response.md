The value of `index` is increased by 2. The other variables (`r`, `c`, `rows`, `cols`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` contains `{r, c}` if `r` is not equal to `c`, `cols` contains `{c, r}` if `r` is not equal to `c`**
