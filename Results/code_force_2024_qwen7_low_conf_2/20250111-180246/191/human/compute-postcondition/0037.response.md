`rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Since `c` is the integer value of `data[index]`, the set `rows` now contains the value `r` (previously stored) and the new value `c`. The other variables remain unchanged: `r` is still the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, and `c` is the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `rows` contains the values `r` and `c`.**
