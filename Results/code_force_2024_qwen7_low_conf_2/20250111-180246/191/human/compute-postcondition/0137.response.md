The code `m = min(free_rows, free_cols)` assigns the minimum value between `free_rows` and `free_cols` to the variable `m`. The values of `t`, `k`, `data`, `index`, `rows`, `cols`, `free_rows`, and `free_cols` remain unchanged.

- `t` is greater than 1.
- `k` is non-negative.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `index` is increased by `2 * k + 2 * k` (or `2 * k + 2 * (k - 1)` depending on the number of iterations).
- `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices that were added during the iterations.
- `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices that were added during the iterations.
- `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`.
- `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`.

Since the exact values of `free_rows` and `free_cols` are not specified, `m` will be assigned the minimum of these two values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` is non-negative, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by `2 * k + 2 * k` (or `2 * k + 2 * (k - 1)` depending on the number of iterations), `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices that were added during the iterations, `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices that were added during the iterations, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)`**.
