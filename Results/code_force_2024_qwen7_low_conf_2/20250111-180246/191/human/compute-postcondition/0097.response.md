Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `rows` contains all unique integers `r` from `data` such that `r` corresponds to the row indices from `data[index - 2]` to `data[index - 2] + k - 1`, `cols` contains all unique integers `c` from `data` such that `c` corresponds to the column indices from `data[index - 1]` to `data[index - 1] + k - 1`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is `min(n - len(rows), n - len(cols))`, `index` is increased by `2 * k`, `result` is `result * (m + 1) % MOD * 3 % MOD * 3 % MOD`, `i` is 3**
