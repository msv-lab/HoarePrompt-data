`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. Based on the initial state, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `index` is increased by 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `rows` contains the value `r`, `cols` contains the value `c`.**
