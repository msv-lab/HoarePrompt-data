Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial State**: 
   - `r` is `int(data[index - 2])`
   - `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`
   - `index` is increased by 2
   - `rows` contains `{int(data[index]), c}`
   - `cols` contains `{c, r}`

2. **Understand the Loop**:
   - The loop is defined as `for _ in range(k):`, meaning it will iterate `k` times.

3. **Determine the Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the value of `_` (which is an iterator variable) must be less than `k`.

4. **Adjust the States**:
   - Since `index` is increased by 2 at the end of each iteration, we need to adjust `index` for the next iteration.
   - After the first iteration, `index` would be increased by 2 from its initial value. Therefore, for the next iteration, `index` should be increased by 2 again.
   - `r` and `c` will be updated based on the new value of `index`.
   - `rows` and `cols` will be updated with the new values of `r` and `c`.

5. **Calculate the New Values**:
   - After the first iteration, `index` is increased by 2, so `index` becomes `index + 2`.
   - `r` becomes `int(data[index])` (since `index` was increased).
   - `c` remains the same as it was not updated in this iteration.
   - `rows` will contain `{int(data[index + 2]), c}`.
   - `cols` will contain `{c, int(data[index + 2])}`.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `r` will be updated to `int(data[index])` (after the increase in `index`).
   - `c` remains the same.
   - `index` will be increased by 2.
   - `rows` will be `{int(data[index]), c}`.
   - `cols` will be `{c, int(data[index])}`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` contains `{int(data[index + 2]), c}`, `cols` contains `{c, int(data[index])}`**
