`r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `data` at the position `index` is converted to an integer and assigned to `r`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is unchanged**
