The code initializes an empty list named `results`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `data`, and `index`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer (specific value), `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
