`index` is incremented by 2. The value of `t` is decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`. After executing the code, the value of `index` is updated, while the conditions and values of `t`, `n`, and `k` remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `index` is increased by 2**
