Postcondition: ***`r` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` contains `{int(data[index]), c}`, `cols` contains `{c, r}`***

Explanation: Since the `else` part is empty and the `if` condition `r != c` ensures that `cols.add(r)` is executed, the postcondition remains unchanged from the precondition. The set `cols` already contains both `c` and `r`, so adding `r` again does not alter its contents. Therefore, the overall postcondition is the same as the precondition.
