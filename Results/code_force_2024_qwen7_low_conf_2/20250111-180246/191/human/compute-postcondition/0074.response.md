`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. Since `cols` already contains `{c, r}`, adding `c` again does not change the set because sets do not allow duplicate elements. The value of `index` is increased by 2, and the value of `r` remains `int(data[index - 2])` and `c` remains `int(data[index - 1])`.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` contains `{int(data[index])}`, `cols` contains `{c, r}`**
