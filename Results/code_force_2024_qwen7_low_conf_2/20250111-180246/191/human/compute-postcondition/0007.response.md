The code assigns the integer value from `data[index]` to the variable `n`. Since `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, the value of `data[index]` is converted to an integer using `int()`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`**
