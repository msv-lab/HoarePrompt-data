According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute if `t` is at least 1. Given the initial state, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `t` is greater than 0.

Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Variable `t`:** The loop will run for `t` times. For the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1.
2. **Variables `n`, `k`, `data`, `index`, and `results`:** These variables do not affect whether the loop runs or not directly based on the given code snippet. They will be used within the loop body but do not need to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is ensuring that `t` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
