The code initializes the `cols` variable as an empty set. This does not affect the values of the other variables. The precondition states that `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, and `rows` is an empty set. After executing the line `cols = set()`, the `cols` variable is now an empty set.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` is an empty set, and `cols` is an empty set.**
