The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Initially, `index` is 1. After the operation, `index` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list**
