`rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the list `rows`. Initially, `rows` contains `[r, c, r]`. Since `c` is already present in the list, adding it again does not change the list. However, we should still note this operation for clarity.

- The value of `k` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- The value of `r` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- The value of `c` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it.
- The value of `index` is updated to its original value plus 4.
- The value of `rows` is updated to `[r, c, r, c]` since `c` is added to the existing list.

Output State: **`k` is \( k - 1 \) (greater than 0); `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is the original value of `index` plus 4; `rows` is `[r, c, r, c]`**
