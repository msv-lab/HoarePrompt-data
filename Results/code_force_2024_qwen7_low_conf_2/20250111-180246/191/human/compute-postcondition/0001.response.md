The code reads input using `input().split()` and splits the input into a list of strings. This affects the `data` variable by assigning it the list of split strings. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
