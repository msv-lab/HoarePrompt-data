The code `rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. This does not change the value of `r`, `data`, or `index`, but it does affect the contents of the set `rows`. Since `c` is defined as the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, its calculation is dependent on the original value of `data` and the original value of `index`, which remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `rows` contains the value `r`.**
