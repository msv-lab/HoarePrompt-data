`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. The value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, which is at least 3 according to the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` must be at least 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is at least 3, and `rows` contains `r`; `cols` is a set containing `c`.**
