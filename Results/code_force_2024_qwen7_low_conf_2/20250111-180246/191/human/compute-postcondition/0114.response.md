The code adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. Since `cols` was initially a set containing `c`, after adding `r`, `cols` will now contain both `c` and `r`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` must be at least 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is at least 3, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing `c` and `r`.**
