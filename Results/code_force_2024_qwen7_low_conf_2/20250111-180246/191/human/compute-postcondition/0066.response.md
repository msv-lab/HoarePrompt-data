`rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Initially, `rows` contains the value `r`. After adding `c` to `rows`, `rows` now contains both `r` and `c`. The value of `r` remains unchanged, and the value of `c` also remains unchanged. The value of `index` is increased by 2, but the exact new value of `index` is not specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer from `data[index - 1]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged, `rows` contains `{r, c}`, `cols` contains `{c}`, `index` is increased by 2**
