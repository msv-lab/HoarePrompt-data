`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the list `cols`. Initially, `cols` contains `[r, c, r]`. After adding `c` to the list, `cols` will contain `[r, c, r, c]`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged:
- `k` is \( k - 1 \) (greater than 0)
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `index` is the original value of `index` plus 4
- `rows` contains `[r, c, r]`

Output State: **`k` is \( k - 1 \) (greater than 0); `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is the original value of `index` plus 4; `rows` contains [r, c, r]; `cols` contains [r, c, r, c]**
