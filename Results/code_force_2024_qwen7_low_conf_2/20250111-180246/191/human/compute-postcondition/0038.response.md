`cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. Since `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, it remains unchanged. The value of `index` is increased by 2, and the value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index]`, which is not affected by this operation. The value of `rows` contains the values `r` and `c`. Therefore, the set `cols` now includes the value of `r`.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `rows` contains the values `r` and `c`, `cols` contains the value `r`.**
