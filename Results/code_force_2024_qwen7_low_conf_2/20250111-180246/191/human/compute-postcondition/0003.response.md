`t` is assigned the value of `data[index]`, which is a string. Since `index` is 0, `t` is assigned the first element of the `data` list as an integer. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (specific value), `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `index` is 0**
