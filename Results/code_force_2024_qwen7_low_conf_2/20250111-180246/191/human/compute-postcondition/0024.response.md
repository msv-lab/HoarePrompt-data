The code updates the value of `c` to be the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. According to the initial state, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, which means updating `c` does not change its value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`k` is \( k - 1 \) (greater than 0), `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `r` is not equal to `c`; `cols` contains `r`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
