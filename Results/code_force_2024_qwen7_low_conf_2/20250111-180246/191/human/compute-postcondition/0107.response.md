The code `r = int(data[index])` assigns the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer to the variable `r`. The values of `t` and `k` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `k` must be at least 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` must be at least 1; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
