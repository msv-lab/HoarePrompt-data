`cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. Given the initial state, `r` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` contains `{int(data[index]), c}`, and `cols` contains `{c, r}`. 

Since `cols` already contains `c` and `r`, adding `r` again does not change the set `cols`. However, the value of `r` remains `int(data[index - 2])`.

The output state is:
**`r` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` contains `{int(data[index]), c}`, `cols` contains `{c, r}`**
