The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of `res`. Since no assignment or other operation is performed on `res`, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the only impact is that `res` is printed.

Output State: **`total` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \times 10^5\), `k` is an integer such that \(0 \leq k \leq n\), `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is the final value of `index` after all iterations, `results` contains at least two elements, `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices that were added during the iterations, `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices that were added during the iterations, and `res` is printed.**
