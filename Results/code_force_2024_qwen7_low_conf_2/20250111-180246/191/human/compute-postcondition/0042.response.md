The code updates the value of `free_cols` by calculating `n - len(cols)`. This does not affect the values of `k`, `r`, `c`, `index`, `rows`, or `cols`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

- `k` is still greater than 0.
- `r` remains the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`.
- `c` remains the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`.
- `index` is updated to `index + 2*k`.
- `rows` is a set containing the unique values of `r` and `c` from each iteration.
- `cols` is a set containing the unique values of `c` and `r` where `r` is not equal to `c`.
- `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`.
- `free_cols` is now `n - len(cols)`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2*k, `rows` is a set containing the unique values of `r` and `c` from each iteration, `cols` is a set containing the unique values of `c` and `r` where `r` is not equal to `c`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`**
