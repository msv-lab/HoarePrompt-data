The code `rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. Given the initial state, `r` is already included in `rows` because `rows` was defined as a set containing both `r` and `c` if `r` is not equal to `c`, otherwise it contains only `c`. Adding `r` again to the set `rows` does not change the set since sets do not allow duplicate elements.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is `int(data[int(data[index]) + 2]) + 2`, `r` is `int(data[index])`, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` if `r` is not equal to `c`, otherwise it contains only `c`, `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c` since `r` is added to the existing set, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`**
