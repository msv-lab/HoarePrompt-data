`rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. Since `r` is `int(data[index])`, the set `rows` now contains `r`. The other operations (increasing `index` by 2, and adding `{r, c}` to `rows` if `r` is not equal to `c`) are not performed because only one operation (`rows.add(r)`) is given in the snippet.

Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` contains `{int(data[index])}`, `cols` contains `{c, r}` if `r` is not equal to `c`.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` contains `{int(data[index])}`, `cols` contains `{c, r}` if `r` is not equal to `c`**
