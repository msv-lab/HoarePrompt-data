Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop `for _ in range(k):` will execute as long as `k` is greater than 0.

2. **Current States**:
   - `t` is greater than 0 (This does not directly affect the loop condition).
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`.
   - `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`.
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.
   - `index` is 3.
   - `results` is an empty list.
   - `rows` is an empty set.
   - `cols` is an empty set.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - For the loop to execute, `k` must be greater than 0. This is because the loop runs for `k` iterations.
   - We need to ensure that `k` is indeed a positive integer.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `k` must be greater than 0.

Given these points, the final answer is:

State: **`k` must be greater than 0**
