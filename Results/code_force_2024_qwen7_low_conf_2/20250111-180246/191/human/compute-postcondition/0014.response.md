The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` (which is an integer) to the variable `c`. The value of `k` remains greater than 0, and the value of `r` remains the integer value of `data[index]`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
