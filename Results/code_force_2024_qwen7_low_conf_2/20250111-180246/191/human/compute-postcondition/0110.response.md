`rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. The value of `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 1, `k` must be at least 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is at least 3, and the set `rows` now contains the value of `r`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` must be at least 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is at least 3, and `rows` contains `r`.**
