`index` is incremented by 2, which means the value of `index` is updated from its previous value to the next value skipping two positions. Given the initial conditions, the new value of `index` will be `int(data[index]) + 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is `int(data[int(data[index]) + 2]) + 2`, `r` is `int(data[index])`, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` if `r` is not equal to `c`, otherwise it contains only `c`, `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c` since `r` is added to the existing set, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`**
