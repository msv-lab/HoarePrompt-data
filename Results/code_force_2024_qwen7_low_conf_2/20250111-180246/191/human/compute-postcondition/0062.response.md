The value of `index` is incremented by 2, and the other variables (`r`, `c`, and `data`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged, and `index` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged, and `index` is increased by 2.**
