The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `index`. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the list `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; `index` is 0**
