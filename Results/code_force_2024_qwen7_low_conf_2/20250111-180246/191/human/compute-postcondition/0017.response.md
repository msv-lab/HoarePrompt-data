`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. The value of `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Since `index` is increased by 2, the new value of `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, now added to `cols`; `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2; `rows` contains `r`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, now added to `cols`; `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2; `rows` contains `r`**.
