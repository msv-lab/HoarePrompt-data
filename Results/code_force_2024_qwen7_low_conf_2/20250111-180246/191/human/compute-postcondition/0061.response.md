`c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `r` remains unchanged, and the values of `data` and `index` are also unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged.
Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index]`, `c` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged**
