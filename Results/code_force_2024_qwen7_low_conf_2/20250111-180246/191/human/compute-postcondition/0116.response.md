According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 0. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is greater than 1, `k` must be at least 1, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c`, and `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then `rows` and `cols` are sets containing both `r` and `c`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be decreased by 1 and must still be greater than 0. Since `k` was at least 1 before the last iteration, it will now be 0.

State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c`, `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then `rows` and `cols` are sets containing both `r` and `c`.**
