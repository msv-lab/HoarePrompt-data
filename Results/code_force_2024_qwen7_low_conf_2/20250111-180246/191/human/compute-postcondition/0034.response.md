The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The values of `r` and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
