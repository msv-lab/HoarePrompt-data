The code adds `r` to the set `cols`. Since `cols` initially contains both `r` and `c` if `r` is not equal to `c`, otherwise it contains only `c`, adding `r` will ensure `cols` contains `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`) or just `c` (if `r` is equal to `c`). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `data` is unchanged, `index` is `int(data[index]) + 2`, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` if `r` is not equal to `c`, otherwise it contains only `c`, `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (since `r` is added to the existing set)**
