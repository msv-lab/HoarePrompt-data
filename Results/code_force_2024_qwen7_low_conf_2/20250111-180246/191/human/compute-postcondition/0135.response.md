The code `free_rows = n - len(rows)` assigns the value of `n` minus the length of the set `rows` to the variable `free_rows`. The variables `t`, `k`, `data`, `index`, `rows`, and `cols` are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` is non-negative, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by `2 * k + 2 * k` (or `2 * k + 2 * (k - 1)` depending on the number of iterations), `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices that were added during the iterations, `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices that were added during the iterations, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`**
