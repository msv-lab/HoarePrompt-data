Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a board size `n`, the number of rook moves `k`, and `k` pairs of row and column indices representing the moves. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of moves required to place `k` non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks can attack each other either horizontally or vertically. It then computes the factorial of this minimum number of moves (`m`) modulo a constant `MOD` and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result from the list.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `n == 0` or `k == 0`, the function should handle these cases appropriately. However, since `1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5` and `0 ≤ k ≤ n`, these edge cases are unlikely to occur.
- If `k > n`, the function will still proceed, but this is an invalid scenario since it's impossible to place more than `n` non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` board. The function does not explicitly check for this condition, so it will still compute the result, which will be `0`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- There is no explicit handling for the case when `n < 1` or `k < 0`. While these conditions are not possible given the constraints, proper validation could improve robustness.
- The function assumes that the input data is always valid and follows the specified format. No error handling is included for malformed input data.
