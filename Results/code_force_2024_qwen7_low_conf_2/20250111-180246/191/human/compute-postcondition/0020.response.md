The code adds the variable `r` to the set `cols`. Given the initial state:

- `k` is greater than 0
- `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, now added to `cols`
- `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2
- `rows` contains `r` and `c`
- `r` is not equal to `c`

After executing `cols.add(r)`:

- The set `cols` now includes `r`.
- The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, now added to `cols`, `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, and `r` is not equal to `c`; `cols` contains `r`.**
