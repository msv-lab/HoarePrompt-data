`index` is incremented by 2, which means the value of `index` is updated. The values of `k`, `r`, and `c` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2**
