`r` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is converted to an integer, but the specific value of `data[index]` is not given. The precondition that `k` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`k` must be greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
