The code `free_rows = n - len(rows)` assigns the value of `n` minus the length of the set `rows` to the variable `free_rows`. The lengths of the sets `cols` and `rows` remain unchanged, as well as the values of `k`, `r`, `c`, `index`, `data`, and `n`. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `free_rows`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2*k, `rows` is a set containing the unique values of `r` and `c` from each iteration, `cols` is a set containing the unique values of `c` and `r` where `r` is not equal to `c`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`**
