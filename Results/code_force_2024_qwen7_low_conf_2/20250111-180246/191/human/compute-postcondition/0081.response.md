The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Based on the initial state, we know that `index` was previously updated to `index + 4`. So, the new value of `index` will be `index + 6`.

The other variables (`r`, `c`, `rows`, and `cols`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index + 2])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 6`, `rows` contains `{int(data[index + 2]), int(data[index + 1])}`, `cols` contains `{int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 4])}`**
