Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is the original value of `index` plus 4, `rows` is `[r, c, r, c]`, and `cols` is a set containing the value `r`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then `cols` is updated to contain only the value `r`.***
