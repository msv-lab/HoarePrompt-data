Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `rows` contains all unique integers `r` from `data` such that `r` corresponds to the row indices from `data[index - 2]` to `data[index - 2] + k - 1`, `cols` contains all unique integers `c` from `data` such that `c` corresponds to the column indices from `data[index - 1]` to `data[index - 1] + k - 1`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is `min(n - len(rows), n - len(cols))`, `index` is increased by `2 * k`, `result` is `result * (m + 1)! % MOD`**

Explanation:
- The loop runs for `i` ranging from 1 to `m + 1`.
- In each iteration, `result` is updated by multiplying it with `i` modulo `MOD`.
- After `m + 1` iterations, `result` becomes the product of all integers from 1 to `m + 1` modulo `MOD`, which is `(m + 1)! % MOD`.

Since the loop continues until `m + 1` iterations are completed, the final value of `result` will be the factorial of `m + 1` modulo `MOD`. All other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, `rows`, `cols`, `free_rows`, `free_cols`, `m`, and `index`) retain their values as they do not change within the loop.
