`rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. The value of `r` is an integer from `data[index]`, and the value of `c` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`. The variables `data` and `index` remain unchanged, and `index` is increased by 2 after the addition.

Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer from `data[index - 1]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged, `rows` contains `{r}`, and `index` is increased by 2.**
