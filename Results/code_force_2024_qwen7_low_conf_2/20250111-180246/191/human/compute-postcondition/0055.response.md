`k` is assigned the value of `data[index + 1]` converted to an integer. The value of `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, which remains unchanged. The value of `t` is decremented by 1 but remains greater than 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1 and must still be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.**
