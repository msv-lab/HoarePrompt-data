The code `cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. Since `cols` already contains `r` and `c` (as `r` is added to the set when `cols` is defined), adding `c` again does not change the set `cols`. The value of `t`, `k`, `data`, `index`, `r`, `rows`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is `int(data[int(data[index]) + 2]) + 2`, `r` is `int(data[index])`, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` if `r` is not equal to `c`, otherwise it contains only `c`, `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`**
