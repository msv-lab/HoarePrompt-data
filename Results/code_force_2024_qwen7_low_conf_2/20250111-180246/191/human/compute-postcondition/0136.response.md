The code updates the variable `free_cols` to be `n - len(cols)`. This means that `free_cols` is now calculated based on the current length of the `cols` set. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` is non-negative, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by `2 * k + 2 * k` (or `2 * k + 2 * (k - 1)` depending on the number of iterations), `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices that were added during the iterations, `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices that were added during the iterations, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`**
