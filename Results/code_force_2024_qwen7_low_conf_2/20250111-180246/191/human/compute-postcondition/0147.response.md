Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ `n`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is the final value of `index` after all iterations, `results` is a list containing the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD` for each iteration, where `m` is `min(n - len(rows), n - len(cols))`, `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices that were added during the iterations, `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices that were added during the iterations.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations, `t` will be the number of times the outer loop executed.
- Each iteration of the outer loop sets `n`, `k`, and updates `index`.
- For each `k`, the inner loop adds unique row and column indices to `rows` and `cols` sets respectively.
- The value of `m` is determined based on the size of these sets.
- The product calculation `result` is performed for each iteration, and the final result is appended to `results`.
- The sets `rows` and `cols` will contain all unique row and column indices added during all iterations.
- If the loop does not execute, `results` will remain an empty list, and `index` will be its original value.
