The code `rows = set()` initializes an empty set named `rows`. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `k`, or `index`. The preconditions that `t` must still be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, and `index` is increased by 2 remain valid.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, and `rows` is an empty set.**
