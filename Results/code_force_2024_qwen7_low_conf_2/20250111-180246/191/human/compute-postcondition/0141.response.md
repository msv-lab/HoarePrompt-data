Let's break down the information given and adjust the states step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `free_rows` is at least 1.
   - `free_cols` is at least 1.
   - `t` is greater than 1.
   - `k` is non-negative.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `index` is increased by `2 * k + 2 * k` (or `2 * k + 2 * (k - 1)` depending on the number of iterations).
   - `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices that were added during the iterations.
   - `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices that were added during the iterations.
   - `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)`.
   - `result` is `i % MOD`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, m + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = m`.
   - The value of `m` is determined by `m = min(free_rows, free_cols)`.
   - Since the loop increments `i` by 1 each time, if the loop is executing, it means that `i` is currently in the range `[1, m]`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `m + 1`.
   - Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is now `m + 1`.
   - Since `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)`, `m + 1` should be the new value of `i`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `free_rows` and `free_cols` remain unchanged because the loop does not modify these values directly.
   - `t` remains greater than 1.
   - `k` remains non-negative.
   - `data` remains unchanged.
   - `index` increases by `2 * k + 2 * k` or `2 * k + 2 * (k - 1)` based on the number of iterations, but this does not affect the loop condition.
   - `rows` and `cols` remain as sets of unique indices added during the iterations.
   - `m` remains `min(free_rows, free_cols)`.
   - `result` is updated to `i % MOD`, so it will now be `(m + 1) % MOD`.

Therefore, the adjusted states for the next iteration of the loop are:

**State: **`free_rows` is at least 1, `free_cols` is at least 1, `t` is greater than 1, `k` is non-negative, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by `2 * k + 2 * k` (or `2 * k + 2 * (k - 1)` depending on the number of iterations), `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices that were added during the iterations, `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices that were added during the iterations, `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)`, `result` is `(m + 1) % MOD`**
