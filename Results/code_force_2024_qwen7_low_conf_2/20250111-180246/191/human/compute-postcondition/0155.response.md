The function `func_1` accepts no parameters directly specified in the provided code snippet. However, based on the context provided, it seems the function might be expected to handle a series of test cases where each test case involves the following:

- An integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`.
- For each test case, two integers `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5` and `0 ≤ k ≤ n`.
- A series of moves represented as pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` where `1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n`.

No two rooks attack each other during these moves.

Given the provided output cases are not explicitly defined in the code but rather described, we can infer that the function processes these inputs and returns something related to the rook moves or the state after all moves are processed. However, since no specific return value is mentioned, we assume the function might return a summary or result based on the given inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, `k`, and a series of moves represented as pairs of integers `(r_i, c_i)` for each test case, where `1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4`, `1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5`, `0 ≤ k ≤ n`, and `1 ≤ r_i, c_i ≤ n`. It processes these inputs and returns a result based on the rook moves and their validity.**
