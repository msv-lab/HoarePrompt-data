The code assigns the value of `data[index]` to `r`. The value of `index` was increased by 2 previously, so now it is increased by 2 again. The values of `c`, `rows`, and `cols` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `index` is increased by 4, `rows` contains `{int(data[index + 2]), c}`, `cols` contains `{c, int(data[index])}`.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `index` is increased by 4, `rows` contains `{int(data[index + 2]), c}`, `cols` contains `{c, int(data[index])}`**
