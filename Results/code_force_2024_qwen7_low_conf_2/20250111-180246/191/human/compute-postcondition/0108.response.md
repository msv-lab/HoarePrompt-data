The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to the variable `c`. The initial state tells us that `t` is greater than 1, `k` must be at least 1, and `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`. Since the code only changes the value of `c`, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` must be at least 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
