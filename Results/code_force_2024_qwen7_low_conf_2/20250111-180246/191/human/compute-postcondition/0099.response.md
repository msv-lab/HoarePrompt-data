Let's go through the code step by step:

1. `results.append(result)`: This line appends the current value of `result` to the list `results`. No other variables are directly affected by this line.

From the initial state:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`
- `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`
- `rows` contains all unique integers `r` from `data` such that `r` corresponds to the row indices from `data[index - 2]` to `data[index - 2] + k - 1`
- `cols` contains all unique integers `c` from `data` such that `c` corresponds to the column indices from `data[index - 1]` to `data[index - 1] + k - 1`
- `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`
- `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`
- `m` is `min(n - len(rows), n - len(cols))`
- `index` is increased by `2 * k`
- `result` is `result * (m + 1)! % MOD`

After executing `results.append(result)`, the following changes occur:
- `results` now contains the current value of `result` in addition to any previous values it may have had.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`
- `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`
- `rows` contains all unique integers `r` from `data` such that `r` corresponds to the row indices from `data[index - 2]` to `data[index - 2] + k - 1`
- `cols` contains all unique integers `c` from `data` such that `c` corresponds to the column indices from `data[index - 1]` to `data[index - 1] + k - 1`
- `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`
- `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`
- `m` is `min(n - len(rows), n - len(cols))`
- `index` is increased by `2 * k`
- `result` is `result * (m + 1)! % MOD`
- `results` now includes the current value of `result`

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`; `rows` contains all unique integers `r` from `data` such that `r` corresponds to the row indices from `data[index - 2]` to `data[index - 2] + k - 1`; `cols` contains all unique integers `c` from `data` such that `c` corresponds to the column indices from `data[index - 1]` to `data[index - 1] + k - 1`; `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`; `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`; `m` is `min(n - len(rows), n - len(cols))`; `index` is increased by `2 * k`; `result` is `result * (m + 1)! % MOD`; `results` now includes the current value of `result`**
