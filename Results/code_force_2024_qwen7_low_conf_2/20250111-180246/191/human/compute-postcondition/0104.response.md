The code sets `rows` to an empty set, which means the set `rows` is now empty. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, `data`, `free_rows`, `free_cols`, `m`, `index`, `result`, and `results` remain unchanged from their previous values.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `rows` is an empty set, `cols` contains all unique integers `c` from `data` such that `c` corresponds to the column indices from `data[index - 1]` to `data[index - 1] + k - 1`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is `min(n - len(rows), n - len(cols))`, `index` is increased by `2 * k + 2`, `result` remains unchanged, `results` now includes the current value of `result`**
