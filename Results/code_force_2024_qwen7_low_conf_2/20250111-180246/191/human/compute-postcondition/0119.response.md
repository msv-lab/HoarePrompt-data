The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given the initial state, the value of `index` was originally `int(data[index])` plus the offset due to the precondition that `index` is unchanged. After executing the code, `index` will be updated to its original value plus 2.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `data` is unchanged, `index` is `int(data[index]) + 2`, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`), `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`), `r` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])**.
