`cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. Since `cols` was initially empty, adding `c` means `cols` now contains the element `c`. The other variables (`r`, `data`, `index`, and `rows`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer from `data[index - 1]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged, `rows` contains `{r}`, `cols` contains `{c}`, and `index` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer from `data[index - 1]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged, `rows` contains `{r}`, `cols` contains `{c}`, and `index` is increased by 2.**
