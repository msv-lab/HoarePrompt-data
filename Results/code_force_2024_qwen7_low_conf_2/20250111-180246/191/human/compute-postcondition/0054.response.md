`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`. The value of `t` is decremented by 1 and must remain greater than 0, but the specific value of `t` after decrementing is not given. The value of `data[index]` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is decremented by 1 and must be greater than 0; `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`.**
