The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `k`. Since `index` is initially 1, `index + 1` becomes 2. Therefore, `k` is assigned the integer value of `data[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
