Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` is non-negative, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by `2 * k + 2 * k` (or `2 * k + 2 * (k - 1)` depending on the number of iterations), `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices that were added during the iterations, `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices that were added during the iterations.**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Since `t` is initially greater than 1 and is not modified within the loop, it remains greater than 1.
- **`k`**: Since `k` is used in the range of the loop and is incremented, `k` is non-negative after the loop executes. It will be zero if the loop does not execute at all.
- **`data`**: The `data` list remains unchanged throughout the loop.
- **`index`**: The `index` is incremented by `2 * k + 2` each time the loop iterates. After `k` iterations, the increment would be `2 * k + 2 * (k - 1)`, assuming the loop starts from `k = 1`.
- **`rows`**: The `rows` set contains all unique row indices that were added during the iterations. Each row index is added once, even if it appears multiple times in the `data` list.
- **`cols`**: Similarly, the `cols` set contains all unique column indices that were added during the iterations. Each column index is added once, even if it appears multiple times in the `data` list.

If the loop does not execute at all, the values of `rows` and `cols` remain as initially defined: `rows` and `cols` are both empty sets.
