The code snippet `rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the list `rows`. From the initial state, we know that `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`. Since no new value is provided for `r` in the code snippet, the value of `r` remains unchanged. The initial state also mentions that `rows` contains `r` and `c`, and now `rows` will have the value of `r` added to it.

Therefore, after executing the code snippet, the updated values are:
- `k` is still \( k - 1 \) (greater than 0)
- `r` is still the integer value of `data[index]`
- `c` is still the integer value of `data[index + 1]`
- `index` is still the original value of `index` plus 4
- `rows` now contains `r` and `c`, and the value of `r` has been added to it, making `rows` contain `[r, c, r]`
- `cols` contains `r`

Output State: **`k` is \( k - 1 \) (greater than 0); `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is the original value of `index` plus 4; `rows` contains [r, c, r]; `cols` contains `r`**
