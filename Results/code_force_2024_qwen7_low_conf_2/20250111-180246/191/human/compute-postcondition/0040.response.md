Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2*k, `rows` is a set containing the unique values of `r` and `c` from each iteration, and `cols` is a set containing the unique values of `c` and `r` where `r` is not equal to `c`.**
