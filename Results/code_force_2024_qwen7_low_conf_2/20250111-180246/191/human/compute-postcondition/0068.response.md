Postcondition: ***`r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer from `data[index - 1]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged, `rows` contains `{r, c}`, `cols` contains `{c, r}`, `index` is increased by 2. If `r` is not equal to `c`, then the sets `rows` and `cols` are updated to include both `r` and `c`.***

This postcondition covers both the if and else parts, as there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows from the if part's description.
