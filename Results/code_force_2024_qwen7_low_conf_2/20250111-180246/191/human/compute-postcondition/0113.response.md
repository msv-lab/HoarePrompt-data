`rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Since `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and the precondition states that `rows` contains `r`, the value of `rows` will now include both `r` and `c`. The other variables (`t`, `k`, `r`, `c`, `index`, `data`, `cols`) remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` must be at least 1, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is at least 3, and `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c`. `cols` is a set containing `c`. The current value of `r` is not equal to `c`.**
