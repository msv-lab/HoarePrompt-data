The code `rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Given the initial state, `rows` already contains `r`, `k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, and `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2. After executing the code, `rows` will contain both `r` and `c`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, now added to `cols`, `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, and `r` is not equal to `c`**
