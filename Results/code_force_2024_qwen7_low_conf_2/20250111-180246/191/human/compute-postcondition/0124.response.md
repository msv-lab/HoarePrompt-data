Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is `int(data[index]) + 2`, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` if `r` is not equal to `c`, otherwise it contains only `c`, `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c` since `r` is added to the existing set***
