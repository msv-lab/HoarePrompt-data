The code `rows.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `rows`. The value of `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`. The value of `index` is increased by 2. The states of the other variables (`k`, `c`) are not affected.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0; `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`; `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`; `index` is increased by 2; `rows` contains `r`**
