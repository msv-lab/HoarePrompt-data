The code `cols.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `cols`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is greater than 1
- `k` is greater than 0
- `data` remains unchanged
- `index` is `int(data[index]) + 2`
- `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`)
- `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`)
- `r` is `int(data[index - 2])`
- `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`
- `rows.add(r)` has been executed

Since `cols` already contains `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`), adding `c` to `cols` will only make a difference if `c` was not already in the set. The output state will be:

- `t` is greater than 1
- `k` is greater than 0
- `data` remains unchanged
- `index` is `int(data[index]) + 2`
- `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`)
- `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`) with `c` added, making it a set containing `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`)

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `data` is unchanged, `index` is `int(data[index]) + 2`, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`), `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`) with `c` added**
