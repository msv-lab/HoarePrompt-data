The code initializes a set named `cols`. The set `cols` is empty, and the values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `rows` is an empty set, `cols` is an empty set**
