The code snippet appends the current value of `result` to the list `results`. This does not affect the values of the individual variables but does modify the list `results`.

- `k` remains greater than 0.
- `r` remains the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`.
- `c` remains the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`.
- `index` remains the original value of `index` plus `2*k`.
- `rows` remains the set containing the unique values of `r` and `c` from each iteration.
- `cols` remains the set containing the unique values of `c` and `r` where `r` is not equal to `c`.
- `free_rows` remains `n - len(rows)`.
- `free_cols` remains `n - len(cols)`.
- `m` remains `min(n - len(rows), n - len(cols))`.
- `result` remains the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`.
- `results` is appended with the current value of `result`.

Output State: **`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index - 2*k + 1]`, `index` is the original value of `index` plus `2*k`, `rows` is a set containing the unique values of `r` and `c` from each iteration, `cols` is a set containing the unique values of `c` and `r` where `r` is not equal to `c`, `free_rows` is `n - len(rows)`, `free_cols` is `n - len(cols)`, `m` is `min(n - len(rows), n - len(cols))`, `result` is the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD`, `results` is updated with the current value of `result` appended.**
