Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is `int(data[int(data[index]) + 2]) + 2`, `r` is `int(data[index])`, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` if `r` is not equal to `c`, otherwise it contains only `c`, `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`. If `r` is not equal to `c`, `rows` will contain both `r` and `c`. Otherwise, `rows` will contain only `c`. `cols` will always contain both `r` and `c`.***
