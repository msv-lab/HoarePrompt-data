Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`.
   - `c` is an integer from `data[index - 1]`.
   - `data` and `index` are unchanged.
   - `rows` contains `{r, c}` if `r` is not equal to `c`.
   - `cols` contains `{c, r}` if `r` is not equal to `c`.
   - `index` is increased by 2 at the end of each iteration.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs `k` times.
   - For the loop to execute again, `k` must be greater than 0 (assuming `k` is a positive integer).

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the new state for the next iteration.
   - Since `index` is increased by 2, we need to consider the new values of `data[index - 2]` and `data[index - 1]` for the next iteration.
   - Let's denote the new values as `r_new` and `c_new`.

4. **New Values:**
   - `r_new` is an integer value from `data[index]` (since `index` is increased by 2).
   - `c_new` is an integer from `data[index + 1]`.

5. **Sets Update:**
   - If `r_new` is not equal to `c_new`, then update `rows` and `cols` accordingly.

Given this information, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- `r` is now `r_new`, which is `data[index]`.
- `c` is now `c_new`, which is `data[index + 1]`.
- `data` remains unchanged.
- `index` is increased by 2, so the new value of `index` is `index + 2`.
- `rows` and `cols` will be updated if `r_new` is not equal to `c_new`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`r` is `data[index]`, `c` is `data[index + 1]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged, `rows` contains `{r, c}` if `r` is not equal to `c`, `cols` contains `{c, r}` if `r` is not equal to `c`, `index` is increased by 2**.

This ensures that the loop can proceed with the correct values for `r` and `c` for the next iteration.
