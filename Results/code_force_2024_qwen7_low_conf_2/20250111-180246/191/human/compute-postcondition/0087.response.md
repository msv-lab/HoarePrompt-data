Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[index - 2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[index - 1]`, `rows` contains all unique integers `r` from `data` such that `r` corresponds to the row indices from `data[index - 2]` to `data[index - 2] + k - 1`, `cols` contains all unique integers `c` from `data` such that `c` corresponds to the column indices from `data[index - 1]` to `data[index - 1] + k - 1`, and `index` is increased by `2 * k`. If any `r` is not equal to `c` for a pair `(r, c)`, the corresponding `r` and `c` are added twice to their respective sets.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `k` times, and each iteration extracts a row index `r` and a column index `c` from the `data` list.
- The `index` is increased by 2 after each iteration, meaning that after `k` iterations, `index` is increased by `2 * k`.
- The `rows` set collects all unique row indices, and the `cols` set collects all unique column indices.
- If `r` is not equal to `c`, the sets are updated to include both `r` and `c` (hence the addition twice).
- If the loop does not execute (i.e., `k` is 0), the original values of `rows` and `cols` remain empty, and `index` is still increased by 2 as per the initial condition.
