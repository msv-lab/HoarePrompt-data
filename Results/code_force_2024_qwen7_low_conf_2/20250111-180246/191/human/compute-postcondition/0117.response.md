`r` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. The values of `t`, `k`, `data`, `index`, `rows`, and `cols` remain unchanged. The precondition that `t` is greater than 1, `k` must be greater than 0, and `rows` and `cols` are sets containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`) still holds true.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `data` is unchanged, `index` is unchanged, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`), `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`), `r` is `int(data[index])`**
