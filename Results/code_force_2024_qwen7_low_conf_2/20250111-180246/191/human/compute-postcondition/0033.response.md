`c` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The value of `c` is determined by converting the element in the `data` list at the index `index + 1` to an integer. The states of the other variables (`r`, `data`, and `index`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `data` is unchanged, `index` is unchanged, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
