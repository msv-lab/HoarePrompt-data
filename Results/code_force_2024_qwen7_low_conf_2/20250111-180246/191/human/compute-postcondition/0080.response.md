The code assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` to `c`. Based on the initial state, we know that `index` was increased by 4, so now `index` is `index + 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. Initially, `r` is `int(data[index])`.
2. Initially, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`.
3. Initially, `index` is increased by 4.
4. Initially, `rows` contains `{int(data[index + 2]), c}`.
5. Initially, `cols` contains `{c, int(data[index])}`.

After executing the line `c = int(data[index + 1])`:

- The value of `c` is updated to `int(data[index + 1])`.
- The value of `index` remains `index + 4`.
- The value of `r` remains `int(data[index])`.
- The value of `rows` remains `{int(data[index + 2]), c}`.
- The value of `cols` remains `{c, int(data[index])}`.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is `index + 4`, `rows` contains `{int(data[index + 2]), int(data[index + 1])}`, `cols` contains `{int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index])}`**
