Postcondition: ***`k` is greater than 0, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, now added to `cols`, `index` is the original value of `index` plus 2, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, and `r` is not equal to `c`; `cols` contains `r`.*** 

Since there is no else part, the overall postcondition is determined solely by the if part, which adds `r` to the set `cols` under the condition that `r` is not equal to `c`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the given preconditions.
