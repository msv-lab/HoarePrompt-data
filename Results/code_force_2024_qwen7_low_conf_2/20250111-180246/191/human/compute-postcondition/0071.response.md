The initial state is defined as follows:
- `r` is `int(data[index])`
- `c` is `data[index + 1]`
- `index` is increased by 2
- `rows` contains `{r, c}` if `r` is not equal to `c`
- `cols` contains `{c, r}` if `r` is not equal to `c`

The code snippet is:
```
c = int(data[index + 1])
```

Let's analyze the impact of this code:
1. The value of `c` is updated to `int(data[index + 1])`. Since `index` was already increased by 2 in the initial state, the new value of `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`.
2. The value of `r` remains unchanged, which is `int(data[index])`.
3. The value of `index` remains unchanged since no further increment operation is performed here.
4. The sets `rows` and `cols` remain unchanged because the condition to add elements to them (if `r` is not equal to `c`) is not evaluated again and the values of `r` and `c` have not changed.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` contains `{r, c}` if `r` is not equal to `c`, `cols` contains `{c, r}` if `r` is not equal to `c`**
