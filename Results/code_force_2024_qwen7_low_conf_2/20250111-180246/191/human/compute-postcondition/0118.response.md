The code `c = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the value of `data[index + 1]` converted to an integer to the variable `c`. Since `data` and `index` are unchanged, the values of `t`, `k`, `data`, `index`, `rows`, `cols`, and `r` remain the same. The value of `c` is now the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 1, `k` is greater than 0, `data` is unchanged, `index` is unchanged, `rows` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`), `cols` is a set containing both `r` and `c` (if `r` is not equal to `c`), `r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `int(data[index + 1])`**
