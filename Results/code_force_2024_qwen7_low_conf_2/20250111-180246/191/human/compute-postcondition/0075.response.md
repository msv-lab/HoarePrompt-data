The code `rows.add(c)` adds the value of `c` to the set `rows`. Since sets in Python do not allow duplicate values, this operation will add `c` to `rows` if it is not already present.

- The value of `index` is increased by 2.
- The value of `rows` will include `int(data[index])` and `c` (if `c` was not already in `rows`).
- The value of `cols` remains unchanged and still contains `{c, r}`.

Given the initial state:
- `r` is `int(data[index - 2])`
- `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`
- `index` is increased by 2
- `rows` contains `{int(data[index])}`
- `cols` contains `{c, r}`

After executing `rows.add(c)`, the updated state will be:
- `r` remains `int(data[index - 2])`
- `c` remains `int(data[index - 1])`
- `index` is increased by 2
- `rows` now contains `{int(data[index]), c}`
- `cols` remains `{c, r}`

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`r` is `int(data[index - 2])`, `c` is `int(data[index - 1])`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` contains `{int(data[index]), c}`, `cols` contains `{c, r}`**
