The code `results.append(result)` appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. However, the value of `result` itself is not affected by this line of code. The variables `free_rows`, `free_cols`, `t`, `k`, `data`, `index`, `rows`, `cols`, `m`, and `result` remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`free_rows` is at least 1 or 0, `free_cols` is at least 1 or 0, `t` is greater than 1, `k` is non-negative, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by `2 * k + 2 * (k + 1)` (or remains unchanged if the loop does not execute), `rows` is a set containing all unique row indices that were added during the iterations (or an empty set if the loop does not execute), `cols` is a set containing all unique column indices that were added during the iterations (or an empty set if the loop does not execute), `m` is `min(free_rows, free_cols)` or 0, `result` is the product of all integers from 1 to `m` modulo `MOD` or 1 if the loop does not execute, `results` is a list containing the appended value of `result`.**
