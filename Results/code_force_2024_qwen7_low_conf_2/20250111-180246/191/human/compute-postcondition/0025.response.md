The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Based on the initial state, `index` was originally the value of `index` plus 2, so incrementing it by 2 means `index` now has a value that is 4 more than its original value.

All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`k` is \( k - 1 \) (greater than 0), `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `c` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `index` is the original value of `index` plus 4, `rows` contains `r` and `c`, `r` is not equal to `c`; `cols` contains `r`, `r` is the integer value of `data[index]`**
