`cols.add(r)` adds the value of `r` to the set `cols`. Initially, `cols` contains `{c}`. After adding `r`, `cols` will contain both `c` and `r`. The value of `r` and `c` remain the same as in the initial state. Additionally, the value of `index` is increased by 2.

Output State: **`r` is an integer value from `data[index - 2]`, `c` is an integer from `data[index - 1]`, `data` and `index` are unchanged, `rows` contains `{r, c}`, `cols` contains `{c, r}`, `index` is increased by 2**
