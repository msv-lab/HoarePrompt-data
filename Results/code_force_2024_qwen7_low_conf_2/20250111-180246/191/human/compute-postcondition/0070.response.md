The code changes the value of `r` to `int(data[index])`. Initially, `r` was `data[index]`. After the code executes, `r` becomes `int(data[index])`. The value of `c` remains unchanged, and `index` is increased by 2. The sets `rows` and `cols` also remain unchanged unless `r` was equal to `c` before, in which case they would be updated according to the condition.

Given the initial conditions:
- `r` is `data[index]`
- `c` is `data[index + 1]`
- `data` and `index` are unchanged
- `rows` contains `{r, c}` if `r` is not equal to `c`
- `cols` contains `{c, r}` if `r` is not equal to `c`

After the code:
- `r` becomes `int(data[index])`
- `c` remains `data[index + 1]`
- `index` is increased by 2
- `rows` and `cols` may or may not be updated depending on the new value of `r` compared to `c`

Since the exact values of `data[index]` and `data[index + 1]` are not specified, we cannot determine if `r` equals `c` after the change. Therefore, we assume that `rows` and `cols` could potentially be updated.

Output State: **`r` is `int(data[index])`, `c` is `data[index + 1]`, `index` is increased by 2, `rows` contains `{r, c}` if `r` is not equal to `c`, `cols` contains `{c, r}` if `r` is not equal to `c`**
