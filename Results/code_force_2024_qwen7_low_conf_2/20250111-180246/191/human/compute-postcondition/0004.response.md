The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Given the initial state, `index` was originally 0, so now it becomes 1. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `k`, and `data`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer (specific value), `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5, `k` is an integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ n, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input, `index` is 1**
