You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You are given an n \times n chessboard where you and the computer take turns
alternatingly to place white rooks & black rooks on the board respectively.
While placing rooks, you have to ensure that no two rooks attack each other.
Two rooks attack each other if they share the same row or column regardless of
color.

A valid move is placing a rook on a position (r , c ) such that it doesn't
attack any other rook.

You start first, and when you make a valid move in your turn, placing a white
rook at position (r , c ), the computer will mirror you and place a black rook
at position (c , r ) in its turn. If r = c , then the computer can't mirror
your move, and skips its turn.

You have already played k moves with the computer (the computer tries to
mirror these moves too), and you must continue playing the game until there
are no valid moves remaining. How many different final configurations are
possible when you continue the game after the k moves? It is guaranteed that
the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid. Since the answer may be
large, print it modulo 10^9+7 .

Two configurations are considered different if there exists a coordinate (r ,
c ) which has a rook in one configuration, but not in the other or the color
of the rook on the coordinate is different.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number
of test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \leq n \leq
3 \cdot 10^5 , 0 \leq k \leq n ) — the size of the chessboard and the number
of moves you have already played respectively.

Each of the next k lines of the test case contains two integers r_i and c_i ,
denoting the i -th move you made.

It is guaranteed that the k moves and the implied computer moves are valid.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a new line — the total number
of possible final configurations modulo 10^9+7 .

Example

Input

    3
    
    4 1
    
    1 2
    
    8 1
    
    7 6
    
    1000 4
    
    4 4
    
    952 343
    
    222 333
    
    90 91

Output

    3
    331
    671968183
    
Note

In the first test case, we have a 4 \times 4 grid and you've already played 1
move. After you and the computer play a turn, we have a white rook at (1 , 2
), and a black rook at (2 , 1 ). There are three possible configurations from
this state —

  1. You place a white rook at (3 , 4 ) and the computer places a black rook at (4 , 3 ) as a response. 
  2. You place a white rook at (4 , 3 ) and the computer places a black rook at (3 , 4 ) as a response. 
  3. You place a white rook at (3 , 3 ) and then at (4 , 4 ), or the other way around. They both result in the same configuration.

- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of a board size `n`, the number of rook moves `k`, and `k` pairs of row and column indices representing the moves. For each test case, it calculates the minimum number of moves required to place `k` non-attacking rooks on an `n x n` board such that no two rooks can attack each other either horizontally or vertically. It then computes the factorial of this minimum number of moves (`m`) modulo a constant `MOD` and appends the result to a list. After processing all test cases, it prints each result from the list.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the program only considers the minimum of the free rows and columns (`m = min(free_rows, free_cols)`), but this approach does not account for the correct number of ways to place the remaining rooks.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider all free rows and columns independently and calculate the product of their factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Here’s why the current implementation is incorrect:

- The program incorrectly assumes that the number of free rows and columns that can be used is the smaller of the two values (`min(free_rows, free_cols)`). However, the correct approach involves considering all possible combinations of free rows and columns, which requires a more complex combinatorial calculation.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Calculating the number of free rows and columns.
2. Using combinatorial methods to determine the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without violating the no-attacking rule.

Here's a high-level explanation of how the correct solution might look:

```python
from math import factorial

def calculate_possible_configurations(n, k, moves):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    rows = set()
    cols = set()
    for r, c in moves:
        rows.add(r)
        cols.add(c)
        if r != c:
            rows.add(c)
            cols.add(r)
    
    free_rows = n - len(rows)
    free_cols = n - len(cols)
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to choose free rows and columns
    result = factorial(free_rows) * factorial(free_cols) % MOD
    
    return result

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        moves = []
        for _ in range(k):
            r = int(data[index])
            c = int(data[index + 1])
            moves.append((r, c))
            index += 2
        result = calculate_possible_configurations(n, k, moves)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)

func_1()
```

This approach correctly calculates the number of possible configurations by considering all free rows and columns independently.
