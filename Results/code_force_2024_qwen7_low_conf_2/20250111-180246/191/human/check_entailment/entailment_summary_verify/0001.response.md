### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The code correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into tokens.
   - It initializes variables and processes each test case appropriately.

2. **Handling Rows and Columns**:
   - The code uses sets to keep track of used rows and columns.
   - For each move, it adds the row and column to the respective sets. If the row and column are different, it also adds the column and row to the sets, effectively mirroring the move.

3. **Calculating Free Rows and Columns**:
   - After processing all moves, it calculates the number of free rows (`free_rows`) and columns (`free_cols`) by subtracting the sizes of the sets from `n`.

4. **Determining the Minimum Free Rows/Columns**:
   - It determines the minimum number of free rows and columns (`m`). This step is crucial because the number of configurations depends on the smaller of the remaining rows and columns.

5. **Calculating the Number of Configurations**:
   - It calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the free rows and columns by computing the factorial of `m` (minimum free rows/columns) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Output**:
   - It prints the result for each test case, which is the number of configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

However, there is a critical flaw in the calculation of the number of configurations. The logic assumes that the number of configurations is simply the factorial of the minimum number of free rows or columns. This is not entirely correct because the configurations depend on the specific arrangement of the rooks, not just the number of available slots.

For example, consider a 4x4 board with the following setup after k moves:
- You place a white rook at (1, 2).
- The computer places a black rook at (2, 1).

After this, the remaining rows and columns are:
- Free rows: {3, 4}
- Free columns: {3, 4}

The code would calculate the number of configurations as \(2!\) (which is 2), but there are actually 3 possible configurations as described in the problem note. The code does not account for the specific arrangement of rooks.

### Correctness:
The code does not fully capture the complexity of the problem. The number of configurations should take into account the specific arrangement of the rooks, not just the number of available slots. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

**Final: False**
