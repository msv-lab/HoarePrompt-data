### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The code correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into tokens.
   - It initializes variables and processes each test case appropriately.

2. **Handling Rows and Columns**:
   - The code uses sets to keep track of used rows and columns.
   - For each move, it adds the row and column to the respective sets. If the row and column are different, it also adds the column and row to the sets, effectively mirroring the move.

3. **Calculating Free Rows and Columns**:
   - After processing all moves, it calculates the number of free rows (`free_rows`) and columns (`free_cols`) by subtracting the sizes of the sets from `n`.

4. **Determining the Minimum Free Rows/Columns**:
   - It determines the minimum number of free rows and columns (`m`).

5. **Calculating the Number of Configurations**:
   - It calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the free rows and columns by computing the factorial of `m` (minimum free rows/columns) modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

6. **Output**:
   - It prints the result for each test case, which is the number of configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

The logic in the code matches the problem description and constraints. The sets are correctly used to keep track of used rows and columns, and the calculation of the number of possible configurations is accurate.

### Analysis Using Annotated Code:
- **Initial State**: The program starts with reading the input and initializing variables.
- **Processing Each Test Case**:
  - For each test case, it reads `n` and `k`.
  - It uses sets to track used rows and columns.
  - For each move, it adds the row and column to the sets and mirrors the move if the row and column are different.
  - After processing all moves, it calculates the number of free rows and columns.
  - It determines the minimum number of free rows and columns.
  - It computes the factorial of this minimum value modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
- **Final State**: After processing all test cases, it prints the results.

The annotated code provides clear insights into the state of the program at various stages, validating that the logic is sound and matches the problem requirements.

### Conclusion:
The original assessment accurately describes the logic and confirms that the code is correct. Therefore, the program is correct based on the given problem description and constraints.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **True**
