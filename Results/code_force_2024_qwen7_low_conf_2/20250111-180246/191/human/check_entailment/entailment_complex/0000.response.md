### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - It extracts the dimensions of the board (`n`), the number of moves already made (`k`), and the positions of those moves from the input.

2. **Move Representation**:
   - Rows and columns are stored in sets to avoid duplicates, ensuring that no two rooks share the same row or column.
   - If a move is made where the row and column indices are different, both the row and column indices are added to the respective sets.

3. **Free Spaces Calculation**:
   - The program correctly calculates the number of free rows and columns by subtracting the number of occupied rows and columns from the total number of rows/columns (`n`).

4. **Minimum Free Spaces**:
   - The minimum of the free rows and columns is calculated. This represents the maximum number of additional rooks that can be placed without attacking the existing ones.

5. **Factorial Calculation**:
   - The program calculates the factorial of the minimum free spaces modulo `10^9 + 7`. This correctly represents the number of ways to place the remaining rooks.

6. **Output**:
   - The program outputs the results for each test case, which is consistent with the requirements.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the annotated program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. The steps and calculations are correct, and the output matches the expected results.

### Correctness:
**True**
