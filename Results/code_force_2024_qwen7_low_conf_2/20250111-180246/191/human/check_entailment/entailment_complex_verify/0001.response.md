### Reasoning:

1. **Input Parsing and Initialization**:
   - The code correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into tokens.
   - It initializes variables and processes each test case appropriately.

2. **Handling Rows and Columns**:
   - The code uses sets to keep track of used rows and columns.
   - For each move, it adds the row and column to the respective sets. If the row and column are different, it also adds the column and row to the sets, effectively mirroring the move.

3. **Calculating Free Rows and Columns**:
   - After processing all moves, it calculates the number of free rows (`free_rows`) and columns (`free_cols`) by subtracting the sizes of the sets from `n`.

4. **Determining the Minimum Free Rows/Columns**:
   - It determines the minimum number of free rows and columns (`m`) by taking the minimum of `free_rows` and `free_cols`.

5. **Calculating the Number of Configurations**:
   - The code calculates the number of ways to place rooks on the free rows and columns by computing the factorial of `m` (minimum free rows/columns) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is a crucial part of the solution.

6. **Output**:
   - It prints the result for each test case, which is the number of configurations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Analysis of the Code:

Let's break down the key parts of the code and verify them against the problem description:

- **Reading Input**: The code correctly reads the input and parses it into a list of strings. This part is correct.
- **Tracking Used Rows and Columns**: The code uses sets to keep track of used rows and columns. When a move is made, it adds the row and column to the sets, and if the row and column are different, it mirrors the move by adding the column and row to the sets. This ensures that no two rooks attack each other.
- **Calculating Free Rows and Columns**: The code calculates the number of free rows and columns correctly by subtracting the size of the sets from `n`.
- **Determining the Minimum Free Rows/Columns**: The code correctly determines the minimum number of free rows and columns.
- **Calculating the Factorial Modulo**: The code computes the factorial of `m` (the minimum free rows/columns) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This is a valid approach to calculate the number of ways to place rooks on the free rows and columns.

### Conclusion:

The code follows the problem constraints and logic accurately. The calculations and the logic for determining the number of configurations are correct. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
