Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the number of possible final configurations. Specifically, the program only considers the minimum of the free rows and columns (`m = min(free_rows, free_cols)`), but this approach does not account for the correct number of ways to place the remaining rooks.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to consider all free rows and columns independently and calculate the product of their factorials modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Hereâ€™s why the current implementation is incorrect:

- The program incorrectly assumes that the number of free rows and columns that can be used is the smaller of the two values (`min(free_rows, free_cols)`). However, the correct approach involves considering all possible combinations of free rows and columns, which requires a more complex combinatorial calculation.

A correct approach would involve:
1. Calculating the number of free rows and columns.
2. Using combinatorial methods to determine the number of ways to place the remaining rooks without violating the no-attacking rule.

Here's a high-level explanation of how the correct solution might look:

```python
from math import factorial

def calculate_possible_configurations(n, k, moves):
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    rows = set()
    cols = set()
    for r, c in moves:
        rows.add(r)
        cols.add(c)
        if r != c:
            rows.add(c)
            cols.add(r)
    
    free_rows = n - len(rows)
    free_cols = n - len(cols)
    
    # Calculate the number of ways to choose free rows and columns
    result = factorial(free_rows) * factorial(free_cols) % MOD
    
    return result

MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7

def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        k = int(data[index + 1])
        index += 2
        moves = []
        for _ in range(k):
            r = int(data[index])
            c = int(data[index + 1])
            moves.append((r, c))
            index += 2
        result = calculate_possible_configurations(n, k, moves)
        results.append(result)
    for res in results:
        print(res)

func_1()
```

This approach correctly calculates the number of possible configurations by considering all free rows and columns independently.
