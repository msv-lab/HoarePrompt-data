Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer, `i` is 4, and `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` remains true. If `x[4]` equals 1, `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `counter` is greater than `x[4]`, `counter` is set to `x[4] * 2`. If `counter` is not greater than `x[4]`, `counter` is adjusted to `x[4] * ceil(counter / x[4])`.***
