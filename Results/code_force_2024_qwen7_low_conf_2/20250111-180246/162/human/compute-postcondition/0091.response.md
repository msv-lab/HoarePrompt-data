Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `counter` is an integer.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` (This condition is satisfied since `i` starts from 1).
   - `x` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - If `x[i]` equals 1, then `counter` is 2.
   - Otherwise, the conditions for updating `counter` are as follows:
     - If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, then `counter` is updated to `x[2] * ceil(x[0] / x[2])`.
     - If `counter` is less than `x[2]`, then `counter` is updated to `x[2]`.
     - Otherwise, `counter` is updated to `val * 2` where `val` is the original value of `counter` when the if-else block started executing.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over the range starting from 1 to the length of `x`.

3. **Current Values at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so `i` will become 3.
   - We need to check the conditions for updating `counter` based on the new value of `x[3]`.

5. **Possible Scenarios:**
   - If `x[3]` equals 1, then `counter` remains 2.
   - If `x[3]` does not equal 1, we need to compare `counter` with `x[3]` and update `counter` accordingly.

6. **Updated States:**
   - `i` will be 3.
   - The condition `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` still holds.
   - `x` remains the same list of integers.
   - `n` remains the same input integer.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`counter` is an integer, `i` is 3, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)`, and `x` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer.**
