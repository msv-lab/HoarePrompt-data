Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `counter` is either `x[i]` or `2 * x[i]` (where `x[i]` is an element of `x` such that `0 ≤ i < len(x)` and `x[i]` is not 1), `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < len(x)`, `x[i]` is not equal to 1. If the initial `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, `counter` remains unchanged; otherwise, `counter` is updated to either `x[i]` or `2 * x[i]` as appropriate.***
