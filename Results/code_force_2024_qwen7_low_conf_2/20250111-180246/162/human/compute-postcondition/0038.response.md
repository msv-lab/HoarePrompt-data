`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means the user will input an integer. The value of `n_tests` is unchanged, and the values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `i` are also unchanged. The output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`counter` is the final value determined by the loop, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer input by the user, `x` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `i` is 1.**
