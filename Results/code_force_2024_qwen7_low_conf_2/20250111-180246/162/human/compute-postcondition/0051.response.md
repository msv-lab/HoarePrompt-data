The code sets `counter` to `x[i] * 2`. Given that `x[i]` is not equal to 1, the new value of `counter` is `x[i] * 2`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and the condition `counter >= x[i]` still holds since `counter` was already greater than or equal to `x[i]` and now it is doubled.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers, the element at index `i` is not equal to 1, `counter` is `x[i] * 2`**
