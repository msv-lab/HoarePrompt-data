Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `counter` is an integer.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` remains true.
   - `x` is a list of integers.
   - `n` is an input integer.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from 1 to `len(x)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - If `x[i]` (which is `x[3]`) equals 1, then `counter` is incremented by 1.
   - If `counter` is greater than `x[3]`, then `counter` is set to `x[3] * 2`.
   - Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become 4.
   - We need to check the condition `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` to ensure it still holds true.
   - Also, we need to determine the value of `x[4]` to see how `counter` will be updated.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `i` will be 4.
   - The condition `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` must still hold true.
   - The value of `x[4]` will determine how `counter` changes.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` is 4.
- `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` must remain true.
- `x[4]` will determine the new value of `counter`.

Therefore, the final state is:
**State: **`counter` is an integer, `i` is 4, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` remains true, and `x` is a list of integers, `x[4]` will determine the new value of `counter`**.
