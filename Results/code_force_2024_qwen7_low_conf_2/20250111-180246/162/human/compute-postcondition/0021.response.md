`counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`. The value of `i` is not specified, so it could be any index within the range of `x`. Since the exact value of `i` is not given, the output state will include `counter` being updated based on the value of `x[i]` and `ceil(counter / x[i])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])` for some `i` where `0 ≤ i < len(x)`.**
