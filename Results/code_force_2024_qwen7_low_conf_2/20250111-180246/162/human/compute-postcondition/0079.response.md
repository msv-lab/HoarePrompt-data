`counter` is incremented by 1. Initially, `counter` is `x[0]`, which is 1, so after the increment, `counter` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is 2, `i` is 1, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)`, `x` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer.

Output State: **`counter` is 2, `i` is 1, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)`, `x` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer.**
