Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and `counter` is either equal to `x[i]` or twice the value of `x[i]` depending on whether `counter` is less than `x[i]` or not.**
