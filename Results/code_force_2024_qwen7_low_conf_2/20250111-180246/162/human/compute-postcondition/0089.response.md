Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer, `i` is 2, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)`, `x` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1. If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, then the postcondition remains the same as the if part, i.e., `counter` is `x[2] * ceil(x[0] / x[2])`. Otherwise, `counter` is set to `x[2]` if it is less than `x[2]`, or `val * 2` where `val` is the original value of `counter` when the if-else block started executing.***
