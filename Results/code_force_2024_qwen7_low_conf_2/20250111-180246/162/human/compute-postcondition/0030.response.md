`counter` is assigned the value of `x[i]`. The index `i` is part of the list `x`, which means `counter` now holds the value of the element at index `i` in the list `x`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and `counter` is the value of `x[i]`.**
