The code multiplies the element in the list `x` at index `i` (which is 3) by 2 and assigns the result to `counter`. The value of `i` is 3, so `counter` becomes `x[3] * 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`counter` is `x[3] * 2`, `i` is 3, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)`, and `x` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer.**
