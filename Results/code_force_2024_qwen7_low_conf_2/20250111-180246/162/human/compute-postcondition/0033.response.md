Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with more than one element, and `counter` is updated as follows: if `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, then `counter` is updated to \(v \times \left\lceil \frac{c}{v} \right\rceil\) where \(v = x[i]\) and \(c\) is the previous value of `counter`. Otherwise, `counter` is either equal to `x[i]` or twice the value of `x[i]` depending on whether `counter` is less than `x[i]` or not.**
