According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to the length of the array `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `x` is an array of integers, and `i` is an index within the bounds of `x`. The value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration is `i_end`, and the corresponding element `x[i_end]` has been processed according to the rules provided.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Determine the current value of `i`:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `i_end`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be `i_end + 1`.

2. **Check the condition for the loop to continue:**
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is within the bounds of the array `x`.
   - Therefore, `i_end + 1` must be less than `len(x)` for the loop to continue.

3. **Update the state:**
   - `i` will be `i_end + 1`.
   - `x` remains the same as it is an external variable and its values are not modified within the loop body.

Given these points, we can adjust the state for the next iteration of the loop.

State: **`x` is an array of integers, and `i` is an index such that `i` is `i_end + 1` and `i` must be less than `len(x)`.**

To provide a specific example, let's assume the following values:
- `i_end` (value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration) is 3.
- `len(x)` is 6.

Then the state at the start of the next iteration would be:
State: **`x` is an array of integers, and `i` is an index such that `i` is 4 and `i` must be less than 6.**
