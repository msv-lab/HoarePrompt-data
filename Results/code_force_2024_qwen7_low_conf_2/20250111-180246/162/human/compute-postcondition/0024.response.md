Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ `t` â‰¤ 1000, `n_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and `counter` is either equal to `x[i]` (if `counter < x[i]` is true) or twice the element at index `i` in `x` (if the condition `counter < x[i]` is false)**
