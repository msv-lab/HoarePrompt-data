Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `counter` is `x[0]`
   - `i` is `n_tests - 1`
   - `x` is a list of integers derived from the input split and converted to integers
   - `n` is an input integer

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, len(x)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop starts with `i` set to 1 (inclusive) and goes up to but does not include `len(x)` (exclusive).
   - This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(x)`.

4. **Analyzing the Initial States:**
   - `i` is initially `n_tests - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, `i` needs to be less than `len(x)` when the loop starts.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` is `n_tests - 1`, we need to ensure that `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` for the loop to execute at least once.
   - Additionally, `i` should be adjusted to start from 1 as per the loop condition.

6. **Final States Required for the Loop to Execute:**
   - `i` should be 1 (to match the loop starting condition).
   - `n_tests - 1` should be less than `len(x)`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be 1.
- `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` must hold true.

Thus, the final answer is:
State: **`counter` is `x[0]`, `i` is 1, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)`, `x` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer**
