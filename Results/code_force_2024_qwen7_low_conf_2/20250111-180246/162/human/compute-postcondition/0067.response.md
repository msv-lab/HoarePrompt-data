The code multiplies the value of `x[i]` by 2 and assigns it to `counter`. Since `i` is 5, `x[i]` refers to `x[5]`. Therefore, `counter` is assigned the value of `x[5] * 2`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an array of integers, `i` is 5, `counter` is x[5] * 2**
