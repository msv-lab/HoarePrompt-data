`counter` is updated to the value of `x[i]` times the ceiling of `counter` divided by `x[i]`. Given that `i` is 3, the value of `x[3]` needs to be considered, but its exact value is not specified. The initial value of `counter` is an integer, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Let's denote the initial value of `counter` as `c`. The new value of `counter` will be `x[3] * ceil(c / x[3])`.

Since the exact value of `x[3]` is not provided, let's assume `x[3]` is denoted as `val`. The new value of `counter` will be `val * ceil(c / val)`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 3, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` remains true, `x` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, and `counter` is `val * ceil(c / val)`, where `val` is `x[3]` and `c` is the initial value of `counter`.
Output State: **`i` is 3, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` remains true, `x` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, `counter` is `val * ceil(c / val)`, where `val` is `x[3]` and `c` is the initial value of `counter`.**
