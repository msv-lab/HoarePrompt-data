According to the code, the loop can execute if `n_tests` is at least 1. The variable `t` being between 1 and 1000 does not affect the loop's execution, as it is not used within the loop itself.

Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `n_tests` is greater than 0, because if `n_tests` is 0, the loop will not execute at all.

The state of `t` (which is between 1 and 1000) does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, as long as it falls within this range, but it is good to note its initial value.

So, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure `n_tests` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n_tests` must be greater than 0**
