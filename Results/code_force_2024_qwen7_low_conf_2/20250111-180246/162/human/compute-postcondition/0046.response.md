The code `counter = x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])` impacts the `counter` variable. Initially, `counter` is greater than the element at index `i` of `x`. Let's denote the element at index `i` of `x` as `x_i`.

- `counter` is updated to `x_i * ceil(counter / x_i)`.
- Since `counter` is initially greater than `x_i`, let's denote `counter` as `k * x_i + r`, where `k` is an integer and `r` is the remainder when `counter` is divided by `x_i` (and `r < x_i`).

When we apply the ceiling function, `ceil(counter / x_i)` will be `k + 1` because `counter / x_i` is slightly more than `k` (since `r > 0`).

So, the new value of `counter` will be:
\[ \text{new\_counter} = x_i * (k + 1) \]

Given that `counter` was originally `k * x_i + r`, and now it is updated to `x_i * (k + 1)`, this means the new value of `counter` is exactly one multiple of `x_i` greater than its original value.

Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a list of integers, and the element at index `i` is not equal to 1; `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`.

Output State: **`x` is a list of integers, and the element at index `i` is not equal to 1; `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`**
