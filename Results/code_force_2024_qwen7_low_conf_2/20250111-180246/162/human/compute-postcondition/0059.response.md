`x[i]` is accessed and multiplied by 2, and the result is assigned to `counter`. Since `i` is 4 and `i` must be less than 6, `x[4]` is accessed. The value of `counter` is thus `x[4] * 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an array of integers, `i` is 4, `counter` is `x[4] * 2`.

Output State: **`x` is an array of integers, `i` is 4, `counter` is `x[4] * 2`**
