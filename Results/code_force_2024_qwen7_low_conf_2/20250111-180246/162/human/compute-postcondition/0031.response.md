The code `counter = x[i] * 2` multiplies the value of the element at index `i` in the list `x` by 2 and assigns it to the variable `counter`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the value of `counter` is updated to twice the value of `x[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and `counter` is equal to `x[i] * 2`**
