`counter` is assigned the value of `x[i]`. Given that `i` is 5, `counter` is assigned the value of `x[5]`. The value of `x` remains unchanged, and `i` also remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an array of integers, `i` is 5, `counter` is equal to `x[5]`.

Output State: **`x` is an array of integers, `i` is 5, `counter` is equal to `x[5]`**
