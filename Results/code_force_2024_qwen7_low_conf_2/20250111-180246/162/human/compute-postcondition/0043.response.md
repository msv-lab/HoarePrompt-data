`counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `x[i]` remains 1, and the index `i` is still within the bounds of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `x` and the value of `x[i]` is 1; `counter` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`x` is an array of integers, `i` is an index within the bounds of `x` and the value of `x[i]` is 1; `counter` is increased by 1.**
