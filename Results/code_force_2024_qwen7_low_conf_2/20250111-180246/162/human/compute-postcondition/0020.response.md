`counter` is incremented by 1. The value of `t`, `n_tests`, `n`, `x`, and the length of `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and `counter` is incremented by 1.
