Postcondition: ***`x` is an array of integers, `i` is 5, and `counter` is updated based on the value of `x[5]`. If `x[5] == 1`, `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `counter` is greater than `x[5]`, `counter` is updated to `v * ceil(c / v)` where `v` is the value of `x[5]` and `c` is the initial value of `counter`. If `counter` is less than or equal to `x[5]`, `counter` is set to `max(x[5], 2 * x[5])`.***
