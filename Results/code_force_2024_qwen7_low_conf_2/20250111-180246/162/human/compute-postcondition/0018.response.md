Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and `counter` is updated as follows: if `x[i] == 1` for some `i` where `0 ≤ i < len(x)`, then `counter` is `x[0] + 1`; otherwise, `counter` is either `x[i]` or `2 * x[i]` for some `i` where `0 ≤ i < len(x)` and `x[i]` is not 1, with `counter` remaining unchanged if the initial value of `counter` is greater than `x[i]`.***
