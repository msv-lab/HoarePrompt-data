Postcondition: **`counter` is an integer, `i` is 2, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)`, `x` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer, and `x[i]` is not equal to 1. If `counter` is less than `x[2]`, then `counter` is set to `x[2]`. Otherwise, `counter` is set to `val * 2` where `val` is the original value of `counter` when the if-else block started executing.**
