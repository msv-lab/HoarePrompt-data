Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `counter` is `x[0]`, `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and for all `i` where `0 ≤ i < len(x)`, `x[i]` is not equal to 1, and `counter` is less than or equal to `x[i]`. `counter` is now less than `x[i]`***
