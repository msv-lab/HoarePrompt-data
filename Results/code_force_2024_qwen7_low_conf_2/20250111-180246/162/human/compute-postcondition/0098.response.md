Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer. `i` is 3, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` remains true, and `x` is a list of integers, `n` is an input integer. If `x[i]` (which is `x[3]`) equals 1, then `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `counter` is greater than `x[3]`, then `counter` is set to `x[3] * 2`. Otherwise, `counter` remains unchanged.***
