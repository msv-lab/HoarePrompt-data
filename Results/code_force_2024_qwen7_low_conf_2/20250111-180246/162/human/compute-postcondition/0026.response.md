Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `t` ≤ 1000, `n_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `len(x)` must be greater than 1, and `counter` is updated as follows: if `x[i] == 1`, then `counter` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `counter > x[i]` for some `i` where `0 ≤ i < len(x)`, then `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`. Otherwise, `counter` is either equal to `x[i]` (if `counter < x[i]` is true for some `i`) or twice the element at index `i` in `x` (if the condition `counter < x[i]` is false for all `i`).***
