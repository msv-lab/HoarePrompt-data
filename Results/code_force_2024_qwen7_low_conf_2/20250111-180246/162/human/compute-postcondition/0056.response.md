`counter` is incremented by 1, while `x` and `i` remain unchanged. The value of `i` is still 4, and it is also still true that `i` is less than 6. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an array of integers, `i` is 4, `counter` is 1 (assuming `counter` was initially 0).

Output State: **`x` is an array of integers, `i` is 4, `counter` is 1**
