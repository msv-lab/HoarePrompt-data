The code assigns the value of `x[4]` (since `i` is 4) to the variable `counter`. The value of `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an array of integers, `i` is 4, and `counter` is equal to `x[4]`.

Output State: **`x` is an array of integers, `i` is 4, `counter` is equal to `x[4]`**
