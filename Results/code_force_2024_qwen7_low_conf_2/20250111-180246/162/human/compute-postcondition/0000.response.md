`n_tests` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. This sets the number of test cases. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, `n_tests` is an input integer, and the list of integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n` for each test case is yet to be defined.**
