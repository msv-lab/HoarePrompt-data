Postcondition: ***`counter` is an integer, `i` is 2, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)`, and `x` is a list of integers. `n` is an input integer. If `x[i]` equals 1, then `counter` is 2. Otherwise, `counter` is either `x[2] * ceil(x[0] / x[2])` if `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, or `x[2]` if it is less than `x[2]`, or `val * 2` where `val` is the original value of `counter` when the if-else block started executing.***
