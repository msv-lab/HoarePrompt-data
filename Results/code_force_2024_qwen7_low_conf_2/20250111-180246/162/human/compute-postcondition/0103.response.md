The value of `counter` is updated to be `x[i] * 2`. Since `i` is 4, this means `counter` is updated to `x[4] * 2`. The other variables (`i`, `n_tests`, and `x`) remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `counter` is an integer and its value is `x[4] * 2`, `i` is 4, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` remains true, and `x` is a list of integers.

Output State: **`counter` is an integer and its value is `x[4] * 2`, `i` is 4, `n_tests - 1 < len(x)` remains true, and `x` is a list of integers**
