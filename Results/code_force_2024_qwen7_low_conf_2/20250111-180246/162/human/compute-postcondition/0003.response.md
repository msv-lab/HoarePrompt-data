The code `x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]` takes an input from the user, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `x`. The values of `t` and `n_tests` remain unchanged.

Since the input is a series of integers separated by spaces, let's denote the input as `a b c ...` where `a, b, c, ...` are integers. After executing the code, `x` will be a list containing these integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 â‰¤ t â‰¤ 1000, `n_tests` must be greater than 0, `n` is an input integer; `x` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
