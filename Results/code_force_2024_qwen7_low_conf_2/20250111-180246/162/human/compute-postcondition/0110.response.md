The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t`, an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. This parameter represents the number of test cases.
- For each test case, `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. This parameter represents the number of integers in the list for the current test case.
- A list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n` such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. This list represents the integers for the current test case.

The function has two cases for the output:
- Case_1: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000. The function does not return anything for this case as it only indicates the number of test cases.
- Case_2: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n` such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6. The function does not return anything for this case either, as it only indicates the parameters for each test case.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n` within specified ranges, without returning any specific value.
