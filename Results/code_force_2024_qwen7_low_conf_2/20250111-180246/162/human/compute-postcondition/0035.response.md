Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `x` is a list of integers with at least one element, and `counter` is the final value after the loop has executed, which is determined by the following rules:
- Initially, `counter` is set to `x[0]`.
- For each element `x[i]` in the list `x` where `1 â‰¤ i < len(x)`, `counter` is updated as follows:
  - If `x[i] == 1`, then `counter` is incremented by 1.
  - If `counter > x[i]`, then `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`.
  - If `counter < x[i]`, then `counter` is set to `x[i]`.
  - If `counter` is neither greater nor less than `x[i]`, then `counter` is set to `2 * x[i]`.**
