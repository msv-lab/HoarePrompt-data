Postcondition: **`x` is an array of integers, and `i` is an index within the bounds of `x`. If `x[i]` is 1, then `counter` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `counter > x[i]`, then `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`. If `counter < x[i]`, then `counter` equals `x[i]`. Otherwise, `counter` equals `x[i] * 2`.**
