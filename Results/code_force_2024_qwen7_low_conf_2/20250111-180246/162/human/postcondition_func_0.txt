The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, â€¦, a_n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\). For each test case, it calculates a value `counter` based on the initial value of `counter` (which is the first element of the list `x`) and updates `counter` according to the following rules:
- If the current element `x[i]` is 1, `counter` is incremented by 1.
- If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`.
- If `counter` is less than `x[i]`, `counter` is updated to `x[i]`.
- If `counter` equals `x[i]`, `counter` is updated to `x[i] * 2`.

After processing all elements in the list for each test case, the function prints the final value of `counter`. The function does not return any value and only processes the input data, printing the result for each test case.
