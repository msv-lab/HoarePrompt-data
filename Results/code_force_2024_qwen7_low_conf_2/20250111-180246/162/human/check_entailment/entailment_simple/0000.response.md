Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided annotated program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of how the program aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`n_tests`) and processes each test case one by one.
   - For each test case, it reads the number of signs (`n`) and the periodicities (`a_i`).

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - The variable `counter` is initialized to the value of the first sign's periodicity (`x[0]`).
   - For each subsequent sign, the program updates `counter` as follows:
     - If the current periodicity (`x[i]`) is 1, the next sign can occur immediately after the previous one, so `counter` is incremented by 1.
     - If the current periodicity is greater than the current `counter`, the program sets `counter` to the current periodicity (`x[i]`).
     - If the current periodicity is equal to the current `counter`, the program sets `counter` to twice the current periodicity (`x[i] * 2`). This ensures that the next sign does not overlap with the current one.
     - If the current periodicity is less than the current `counter`, the program calculates the next possible year using `ceil(counter / x[i]) * x[i]` to ensure that the next sign occurs strictly after the previous one.

3. **Output**:
   - After processing all the signs for the current test case, the program prints the final value of `counter`, which represents the year in which all signs will occur and the apocalypse will happen.

The program handles all the scenarios described in the problem statement and ensures that the signs occur sequentially without overlapping, as required. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
