Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where multiple signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `a_i == a_j` for `i â‰  j`). 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  1 1 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

The program incorrectly calculates the year as 2 instead of 1. This happens because the logic inside the loop does not correctly handle the case where multiple signs have the same periodicity. It increments the counter in a way that skips the correct year when the signs align perfectly.
