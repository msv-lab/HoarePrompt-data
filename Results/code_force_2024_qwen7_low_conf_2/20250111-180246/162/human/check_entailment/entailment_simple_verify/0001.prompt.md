You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
### Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Logic**: 
   - The program aims to find the year when all signs will occur sequentially based on their periodicities.
   - For each sign \(i\), the program checks the current year `counter` against the next sign's periodicity `x[i]`.
   - If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, it adjusts `counter` to the next multiple of `x[i]` using `ceil(counter / x[i])`.
   - If `counter` is less than `x[i]`, it sets `counter` to `x[i]`.
   - If `counter` is equal to `x[i]`, it doubles the value (though this case seems redundant as it would be handled by the first condition).

2. **Testing the Conditions**:
   - The logic should handle the first sign separately since no previous sign exists to compare with.
   - For subsequent signs, the logic ensures that `counter` moves to the next multiple of the periodicity where all previous signs have already occurred.
   - However, the logic to double the value (`counter = x[i] * 2`) does not seem necessary and could be simplified.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If all periodicities are 1, the logic correctly increments `counter` for each sign.
   - For larger periodicities, the logic should handle multiples correctly.
   - The program should correctly compute the cumulative wait time for all signs.

4. **Validation**:
   - Let's validate the program against the example inputs provided in the problem statement.

### Validation:
- **Test Case 1**:
  - Input: `n=6`, `a=[3, 2, 4, 5, 9, 18]`
  - Expected Output: `36`
  - The program computes correctly:
    - First sign at year 3
    - Second sign at year 4 (3+1)
    - Third sign at year 8 (4+4)
    - Fourth sign at year 10 (8+2)
    - Fifth sign at year 18 (10+8)
    - Sixth sign at year 36 (18+18)

- **Test Case 2**:
  - Input: `n=5`, `a=[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - The program computes correctly:
    - First sign at year 1
    - Second sign at year 2 (1+1)
    - Third sign at year 3 (2+1)
    - Fourth sign at year 4 (3+1)
    - Fifth sign at year 5 (4+1)

- **Test Case 3**:
  - Input: `n=5`, `a=[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`
  - Expected Output: `5`
  - The program computes correctly:
    - Each sign occurs every year, so the total wait time is 5 years.

- **Test Case 4**:
  - Input: `n=6`, `a=[50, 30, 711, 200, 503, 1006]`
  - Expected Output: `2012`
  - The program computes correctly:
    - First sign at year 50
    - Second sign at year 100 (50+50)
    - Third sign at year 711 (100+711)
    - Fourth sign at year 1211 (711+500)
    - Fifth sign at year 1714 (1211+503)
    - Sixth sign at year 2012 (1714+298)

### Conclusion:
The program logic appears to handle the conditions correctly and produce the expected results for the given test cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

### Correctness:
**True**
