You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
The Chaya tribe believes that there are n signs of the apocalypse. Over time,
it has been found out that the i -th sign occurs every a_i years (in years a_i
, 2 \cdot a_i , 3 \cdot a_i , \dots ).

According to the legends, for the apocalypse to happen, the signs must occur
sequentially. That is, first they wait for the first sign to occur, then
strictly after it, the second sign will occur, and so on. That is, if the i
-th sign occurred in the year x , the tribe starts waiting for the occurrence
of the (i+1) -th sign, starting from the year x+1 .

In which year will the n -th sign occur and the apocalypse will happen?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 1000 ) —
the number of test cases. Then follow the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 100
) — the number of signs.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots,
a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^6 ) — the periodicities of the signs.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the year in which all n signs
will occur.

Note

In the first set of input data of the example:

  * The tribe will wait for the first sign in the 3 -rd year; 
  * the tribe will wait for the second sign in the 4 -th year (since year 2 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the third sign in the 8 -th year (since the second sign has already occurred in the 4 -th year); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fourth sign in the 10 -th year (since year 5 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the fifth sign in the 18 -th year (since year 9 have already passed); 
  * the tribe will wait for the sixth sign in the 36 -th year (since the fifth sign has already occurred in the 18 -th year).

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000, and for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^6.
def func():
    n_tests = int(input())
    for i in range(n_tests):
        n = int(input())
        
        x = [int(i) for i in input().split()]
        
        counter = x[0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(x)):
            if x[i] == 1:
                counter += 1
            elif counter > x[i]:
                counter = x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])
            elif counter < x[i]:
                counter = x[i]
            else:
                counter = x[i] * 2
        
        print(counter)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `counter` is the final value determined by the loop described above, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `n_tests` is greater than 0, and `x` is a list of integers for each test case.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func` accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, and for each test case, an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, a_3, …, a_n` where \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^6\). For each test case, it calculates a value `counter` based on the initial value of `counter` (which is the first element of the list `x`) and updates `counter` according to the following rules:
- If the current element `x[i]` is 1, `counter` is incremented by 1.
- If `counter` is greater than `x[i]`, `counter` is updated to `x[i] * ceil(counter / x[i])`.
- If `counter` is less than `x[i]`, `counter` is updated to `x[i]`.
- If `counter` equals `x[i]`, `counter` is updated to `x[i] * 2`.

After processing all elements in the list for each test case, the function prints the final value of `counter`. The function does not return any value and only processes the input data, printing the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly calculate the year in which all signs will occur. Specifically, it fails to handle the case where multiple signs have the same periodicity (e.g., `a_i == a_j` for `i ≠ j`). 

Consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  3
  1 1 1
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  1
  ```

- Program Output:
  ```
  2
  ```

The program incorrectly calculates the year as 2 instead of 1. This happens because the logic inside the loop does not correctly handle the case where multiple signs have the same periodicity. It increments the counter in a way that skips the correct year when the signs align perfectly.
