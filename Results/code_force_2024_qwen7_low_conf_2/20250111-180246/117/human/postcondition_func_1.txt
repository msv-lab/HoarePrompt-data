The function `func_2` processes a series of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10), a string `s` of length `n` consisting of 'W' and 'B' characters (with at least one 'B'), and calls another function `func_1(n, s)`. The results of these function calls are stored in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, the function prints each result in the list `results`. The function ensures that for each test case, `func_1(n, s)` is called, and the output is collected and printed. If any test case input does not meet the specified conditions (e.g., `n` is outside the range [1, 10] or `s` does not contain at least one 'B'), the function still processes the valid inputs and handles the invalid ones by skipping them or raising an error, depending on the implementation of `func_1`.
