The function accepts an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each of these test cases, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', ensuring at least one character in `s` is 'B'. The function then reverses the string `s` to form a new string `c`. It checks if the count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1. If true, it prints the value `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`, where `a` is the initial integer read and `b` is the original string. If the count of 'B' in `c` is not greater than 1, no specific output is generated. The function does not return anything, but prints the result for each test case.
