You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = input()
        c = str(b[-1::-1])
        if c.count('B') > 1:
            print(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B'))
        else:
            print(a)



- Function Summary: 
The function accepts an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each of these test cases, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', ensuring at least one character in `s` is 'B'. The function then reverses the string `s` to form a new string `c`. It checks if the count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1. If true, it prints the value `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`, where `a` is the initial integer read and `b` is the original string. If the count of 'B' in `c` is not greater than 1, no specific output is generated. The function does not return anything, but prints the result for each test case.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The given solution does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem.
2. The main issue lies in the logic used to determine the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white.
3. The program attempts to reverse the string and find the last occurrence of 'B', but this does not accurately determine the minimum segment length needed to make the entire strip white.
4. Instead, the correct approach should be to identify the position of the first and last 'B' in the string and calculate the distance between these positions plus one (to include both ends).
5. The current solution only considers the case where there are multiple black cells and incorrectly calculates the segment length, failing to handle cases with a single black cell correctly.

Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly solve the problem as described.
