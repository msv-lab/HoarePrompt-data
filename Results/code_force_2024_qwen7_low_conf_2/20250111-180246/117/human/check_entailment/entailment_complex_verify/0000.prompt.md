You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have a horizontal strip of n cells. Each cell is either white or black.

You can choose a continuous segment of cells once and paint them all white.
After this action, all the black cells in this segment will become white, and
the white ones will remain white.

What is the minimum length of the segment that needs to be painted white in
order for all n cells to become white?

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. The descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 10 )
— the length of the strip.

The second line of each test case contains a string s , consisting of n
characters, each of which is either 'W' or 'B'. The symbol 'W' denotes a white
cell, and 'B' — a black one. It is guaranteed that at least one cell of the
given strip is black.

Output

For each test case, output a single number — the minimum length of a
continuous segment of cells that needs to be painted white in order for the
entire strip to become white.

Note

In the first test case of the example for the strip "WBBWBW", the minimum
length of the segment to be repainted white is 4 . It is necessary to repaint
to white the segment from the 2 -nd to the 5 -th cell (the cells are numbered
from 1 from left to right).

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        b = input()
        c = str(b[-1::-1])
        if c.count('B') > 1:
            print(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B'))
        else:
            print(a)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10, and s is a string of length n consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', where 'W' denotes a white cell and 'B' denotes a black cell. It is guaranteed that at least one cell in the given strip is black.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        a = int(input())
        
        b = input()
        
        c = str(b[-1::-1])
        
        if c.count('B') > 1:
            print(a - c.index('B') - b.index('B'))
        else:
            print(a)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an input integer, `b` is the final input provided by the user, `c` is the reversed string representation of the final `b`. If the count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1, the value printed is `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`. Otherwise, no specific output is generated regarding the indices of 'B'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each of these test cases, it reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', ensuring at least one character in `s` is 'B'. The function then reverses the string `s` to form a new string `c`. It checks if the count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1. If true, it prints the value `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`, where `a` is the initial integer read and `b` is the original string. If the count of 'B' in `c` is not greater than 1, no specific output is generated. The function does not return anything, but prints the result for each test case.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  6
  BWWBWW
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  6
  ```

The program does not handle cases where multiple black segments are present. For the input "BWWBWW", the minimum segment to make all cells white is "WWBWW" (from the 2nd to the 6th cell), but the program incorrectly outputs 6, which is the full length of the string. This shows that the program does not account for the scenario where multiple black segments are present and does not find the smallest segment that can turn all black cells to white.
