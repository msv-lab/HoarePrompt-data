Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. Let's consider the following test case:

- Input:
  ```
  6
  BWWBWW
  ```

- Expected Output:
  ```
  3
  ```

- Actual Output:
  ```
  6
  ```

The program does not handle cases where multiple black segments are present. For the input "BWWBWW", the minimum segment to make all cells white is "WWBWW" (from the 2nd to the 6th cell), but the program incorrectly outputs 6, which is the full length of the string. This shows that the program does not account for the scenario where multiple black segments are present and does not find the smallest segment that can turn all black cells to white.
