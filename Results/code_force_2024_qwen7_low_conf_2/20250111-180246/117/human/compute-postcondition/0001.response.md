`a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `a` is an input integer**
