State before the loop starts: According to the code, the loop will execute for each test case specified by the user. The loop requires an input from the user, and this input must be a positive integer within the range [1, 10^4] to ensure the loop runs.

Therefore, the state needs to include the condition that the input must be within the specified range for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**
