The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it appears to process inputs within its scope that include an integer `t` (where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)), and for each test case, an integer `n` (where \(1 \leq n \leq 10\)) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B'. The function guarantees that at least one cell in the string `s` is black.

Based on the provided constraints and the typical structure of such functions, the function likely processes these inputs to count or identify something related to the distribution of 'W' and 'B' in the string `s`.

Given the output cases are not explicitly stated, we focus on the parameters and their constraints:

The functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `t` where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and for each test case within this range, an integer `n` where \(1 \leq n \leq 10\) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', ensuring at least one character in `s` is 'B'.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, it accepts an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10\) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'W' and 'B', ensuring at least one character in `s` is 'B'.**
