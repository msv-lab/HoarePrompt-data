The code `print(a)` simply prints the value of `a`. The values of `b`, `c`, and `t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is printed, `b` is the new input provided by the user, `c` is the reversed string representation of `b`, `t` is 1 less than `a + 1`.

Output State: **`a` is printed, `b` is the new input provided by the user, `c` is the reversed string representation of `b`, `t` is 1 less than `a + 1`**
