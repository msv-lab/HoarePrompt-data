`a` is assigned the value of the new input integer using `int(input())`. The previous value of `a` is replaced by the new input integer, while the values of `t`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer equal to the new input integer, `b` is the new input provided by the user, `c` is the reversed string representation of the new `b`**
