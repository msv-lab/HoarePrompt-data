Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer equal to the new input integer, `b` is the new input provided by the user, `c` is the reversed string representation of the new `b`. If the count of 'B' in `c` is greater than 1, the console outputs the value of `a - c.index('B') - b.index('B')`. Otherwise, no specific output is generated regarding the indices of 'B'.***
