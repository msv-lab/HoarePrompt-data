The code `c = str(b[-1::-1])` reverses the string representation of `b` and assigns it to `c`. The previous value of `c` is the reversed string representation of the new `b`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `a` is an integer equal to the new input integer, `b` is the new input provided by the user, `c` is the reversed string representation of the new `b`**
