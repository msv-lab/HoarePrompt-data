The code snippet `c = str(b[-1::-1])` reverses the string representation of `b` and assigns it to `c`. Here, `b` is an input integer converted to a string, and `b[-1::-1]` reverses this string.

- `a` remains unchanged, so it is an input integer.
- `b` remains unchanged, so it is the new input provided by the user.
- `c` is updated to the reversed string representation of `b`.
- `t` remains unchanged, so it is 1 less than `a + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is the new input provided by the user, `c` is the reversed string representation of `b`, `t` is 1 less than `a + 1`**
