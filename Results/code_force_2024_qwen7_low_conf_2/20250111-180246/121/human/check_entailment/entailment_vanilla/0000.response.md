Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns breaking a number `n` into two numbers `p1` and `p2` such that `p1 ⊕ p2 = p`. The goal is to force the opponent to be unable to make a valid move within 63 moves.

2. **Game Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**: The key observation here is that if the number `n` has an odd number of 1s in its binary representation, Alice can always win by going second. This is because she can always mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that the parity of the number of 1s remains odd.
   - **Bob's Strategy**: If the number of 1s in the binary representation of `n` is even, Bob can force Alice to lose by always responding in a way that maintains the even parity of the number of 1s.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The function correctly identifies whether the number of 1s in the binary representation of `n` is odd or even using `bin(n).count('1') & 1`.
   - If the number of 1s is odd, it prints 'second', indicating Alice wants to go second.
   - If the number of 1s is even, it prints 'first' and then proceeds to break the number `n` into two parts. It selects a part `l` and computes `n ^ l`, ensuring the resulting parts maintain the required properties.

4. **Validation**:
   - The code correctly handles the input and output format.
   - It ensures that the chosen parts maintain the required properties `0 < p1 < p` and `0 < p2 < p` and `p1 ⊕ p2 = p`.
   - It also correctly handles the condition where no valid move can be made, which would result in `-1 -1` being printed.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where Alice goes second when the number of 1s is odd.
   - It also correctly handles the case where Alice goes first when the number of 1s is even and makes a valid move.

The provided program is correct according to the problem statement and the given examples. Therefore, the correctness of the given program is:
