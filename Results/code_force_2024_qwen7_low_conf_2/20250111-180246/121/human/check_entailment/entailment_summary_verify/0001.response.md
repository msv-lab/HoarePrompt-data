### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns breaking a number \( n \) into two numbers \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) such that \( p_1 \oplus p_2 = p \). The goal is to force the opponent to be unable to make a valid move within 63 moves.

2. **Game Strategy**:
   - **Alice's Strategy**: If the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( n \) is odd, Alice can always win by going second. She can mirror Bob's moves, ensuring that the parity of the number of 1s remains odd.
   - **Bob's Strategy**: If the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( n \) is even, Bob can force Alice to lose by always responding in a way that maintains the even parity of the number of 1s.

3. **Implementation Analysis**:
   - **Identifying the Number of 1s**: The function correctly uses `bin(n).count('1') & 1` to determine if the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( n \) is odd or even.
   - **Choosing the Play Order**:
     - If the number of 1s is odd, it prints "second", indicating Alice wants to go second.
     - If the number of 1s is even, it prints "first".
   - **Breaking the Number**:
     - If Alice goes first and the number of 1s is even, the function extracts a part `l` from the binary representation of \( n \) and prints `n ^ l` and `l`.
   - **Handling Bob's Moves**:
     - The function enters a loop where it reads two integers `a` and `b` and updates `n` based on the parity of the number of 1s in `a` or `b`.
     - It continues until `a` equals `b`, at which point the loop breaks.

4. **Validation**:
   - The code correctly handles the input and output format.
   - It ensures that the chosen parts maintain the required properties \( 0 < p1 < p \) and \( 0 < p2 < p \) and \( p1 \oplus p2 = p \).
   - It also correctly handles the condition where no valid move can be made, which would result in `-1 -1` being printed.
   - The function correctly handles the case where Alice goes second when the number of 1s is odd.
   - It also correctly handles the case where Alice goes first when the number of 1s is even and makes a valid move.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where Alice goes second when the number of 1s is odd.
   - It also correctly handles the case where Alice goes first when the number of 1s is even and makes a valid move.

The provided program correctly implements the strategy described in the problem statement. It correctly identifies the play order based on the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( n \) and ensures that the chosen parts maintain the required properties.
