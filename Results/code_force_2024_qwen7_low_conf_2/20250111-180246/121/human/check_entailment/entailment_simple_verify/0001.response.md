### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem involves a game where Alice and Bob take turns breaking a number \( n \) into two numbers \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) such that \( p_1 \oplus p_2 = p \).
   - The goal is to force the opponent to be unable to make a valid move within 63 moves.
   - If the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( n \) is odd, Alice can always win by going second and mirroring Bob's moves.
   - If the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( n \) is even, Bob can force Alice to lose by always responding in a way that maintains the even parity of the number of 1s.

2. **Game Strategy**:
   - Alice’s strategy is to go second if the number of 1s in \( n \) is odd, ensuring she can always mirror Bob's moves.
   - Bob’s strategy is to go first if the number of 1s in \( n \) is even, ensuring he can force Alice to lose by maintaining the even parity.

3. **Implementation**:
   - The function correctly identifies whether the number of 1s in the binary representation of \( n \) is odd or even using `bin(n).count('1') & 1`.
   - If the number of 1s is odd, it prints 'second', indicating Alice wants to go second.
   - If the number of 1s is even, it prints 'first' and then proceeds to break the number \( n \) into two parts. It selects a part \( l \) and computes \( n \oplus l \), ensuring the resulting parts maintain the required properties.

4. **Validation**:
   - The code correctly handles the input and output format.
   - It ensures that the chosen parts maintain the required properties \( 0 < p_1 < p \) and \( 0 < p_2 < p \) and \( p_1 \oplus p_2 = p \).
   - It also correctly handles the condition where no valid move can be made, which would result in `-1 -1` being printed.
   - The while loop ensures that the game continues until either Alice or Bob cannot make a valid move.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code correctly handles the case where Alice goes second when the number of 1s is odd.
   - It also correctly handles the case where Alice goes first when the number of 1s is even and makes a valid move.

6. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The annotated code matches the original assessment and provides clear explanations for each step.
   - The logic for selecting parts \( p_1 \) and \( p_2 \) is sound and follows the rules of the game.
   - The handling of the loop and the condition checks are correct.

### Conclusion:
The provided program is correct according to the problem statement and the given examples. The original assessment is accurate.

**Final: True**
