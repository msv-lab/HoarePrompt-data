You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
This is an interactive problem.

This is the game version of the problem. Note that the solution of this
problem may or may not share ideas with the solution of the solo version. You
can solve and get points for both versions independently.

Alice and Bob are playing a game. The game starts with a positive integer n ,
with players taking turns. On each turn of the game, the following sequence of
events takes place:

  * The player having the integer p breaks it into two integers p_{1} and p_{2} , where 0 \lt p_{1} \lt p , 0 \lt p_{2} \lt p and p_{1} \oplus p_{2} = p . 
  * If no such p_{1} , p_{2} exist, the player loses. 
  * Otherwise, the opponent does either select the integer p_{1} or p_{2} . 
  * The game continues with the selected integer. The opponent will try to break it. 

As Alice, your goal is to win. You can execute a maximum of 63 break
operations. You have the choice to play first or second. The system will act
for Bob.

Here \oplus denotes the [bitwise XOR
operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#XOR).

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line of input contains a
single integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases.

The only line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \leq n \leq
10^{18} ) — the number the game starts with.

Interaction

For each test case, the interaction begins by reading the integer n .

After reading n , print a single line containing either "first" or "second",
denoting what you want to play as (as first or second correspondingly).

On Alice's turn, you are required to print two positive integers, p_{1} and
p_{2} such that 0 \lt p_{1} \lt p , 0 \lt p_{2} \lt p and p_{1} \oplus p_{2} =
p . Here, p equals one of the two integers printed by Bob in the previous
turn. If no turn has occurred previously, p is equal to n . If Alice cannot
perform a break operation, print "0 0" to receive a Wrong answer verdict.

On Bob's turn, you should read two integers, p_{1} and p_{2} such that 0 \lt
p_{1} \lt p , 0 \lt p_{2} \lt p and p_{1} \oplus p_{2} = p . Here, p equals
one of the two integers printed by Alice in the previous turn. If no turn has
occurred previously, p is equal to n . If Bob cannot perform a break operation
p_{1} = 0 and p_2 = 0 in which case you should proceed to the next test case.

If any break operation performed by Alice is invalid, the interactor prints
"-1 -1" and your code should promptly exit to receive a wrong answer verdict.

If Alice performs 63 turns and Bob can still execute a break operation on the
current integers, the interactor prints "-1 -1", and your code should promptly
exit to receive a wrong answer verdict.

After printing a query, do not forget to output the end of line and flush the
output. Otherwise, you will get Idleness limit exceeded. To do this, use:

  * fflush(stdout) or cout.flush() in C++; 
  * System.out.flush() in Java; 
  * flush(output) in Pascal; 
  * stdout.flush() in Python; 
  * see the documentation for other languages. 

In this problem, hacks are disabled.

the interactor.

Note that in the last test case Bob could choose p_1 and perform a break
operation but he gave up.

    for _ in range(int(input())):
        n = int(input())

            print('first')

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are equal, `n` is the last value assigned to `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, else `n` is the last value assigned to `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character.
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) followed by an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18). For each test case, the function checks if the number of '1's in the binary representation of `n` is odd. If it is odd, it prints "second"; otherwise, it prints "first". In the latter case, it further processes `n` by converting its binary representation (starting from the fourth character) to an integer `l` and then prints two values: `n ^ l` and `l`. After this, the function enters a loop where it repeatedly takes two integers `a` and `b` until they are equal. During each iteration, it updates `n` to either `a` or `b` based on whether the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd. It also converts `n`'s binary representation (starting from the fourth character) to an integer `l` and prints `n ^ l` and `l`. The process continues until `a` equals `b`.

The final state of the program after the function concludes is as follows:
- `a` and `b` are equal, with `b` being the last value assigned to `n` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, else `n` remains the last value assigned to `a`.
- `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character.
- No other variables retain their values from previous iterations or test cases.
