Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `n` is `a` (if the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is even) or `b` (if the number of '1's is odd), `l` is the integer value of the binary string of `n` starting from the third character; the output is `n ^ l, l`**
