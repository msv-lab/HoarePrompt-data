`index` is incremented by 2, but the specific values of `data` and the integers `a` and `b` are not altered. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, `a` is an integer from the slice `data[index - 2:index]`, `b` is an integer from the slice `data[index - 2:index]`.

Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, `a` is an integer from the slice `data[index - 2:index]`, `b` is an integer from the slice `data[index - 2:index]`**
