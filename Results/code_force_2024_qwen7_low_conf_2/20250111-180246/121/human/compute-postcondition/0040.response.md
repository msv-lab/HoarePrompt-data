The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to `a` and `b` respectively. This changes the values of `a` and `b`, but does not affect the values of `n` and `l`. The condition regarding `second` being printed or `n ^ l` and `l` being printed is not executed yet.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`**
