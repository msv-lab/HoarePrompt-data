The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers separated by a space from the input and assigns them to `a` and `b`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `b`. Let's denote the input values as `x` and `y` for `a` and `b` respectively.

1. `a` and `b` are assigned the values `x` and `y` from the input.
2. `n` is determined based on the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a`. This means `n` is the count of '1's in the binary form of `x`.
3. `l` is the integer value of the binary string of `n`. This means `l` is the decimal equivalent of the binary representation of `n`.
4. `n ^ l` is printed, followed by `l`.

Since the exact values of `x` and `y` are not specified, let's consider a general case where `x` and `y` are arbitrary integers. The output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`a` is `x`, `b` is `y`, `n` is the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary string of `n`, and `n ^ l` and `l` are printed.**
