Output State: **`t` is `k - 1`, `index` is `len(data)`, `a` and `b` are no longer defined within the scope, `n` is determined based on the final `a` or `b` before the loop breaks, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the 3rd character, and the last print statement outputs `n ^ l` and `l`.**
