The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the loop or condition it is within. Given the initial state where `data` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, and `a` and `b` are both integers from the slice `data[index - 2:index]`, the `break` statement will cause us to exit the current loop or condition without further updating these variables.

Output State: **`data` is unchanged, `index` is increased by 2, `a` is an integer from the slice `data[index - 2:index]`, `b` is an integer from the slice `data[index - 2:index]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
