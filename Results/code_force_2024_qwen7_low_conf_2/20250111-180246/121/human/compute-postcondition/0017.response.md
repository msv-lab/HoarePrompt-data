According to the code, this is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will always execute unless explicitly broken out of. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to continue executing.

However, based on the provided example format, we need to describe the state such that the loop can proceed to the next iteration. Since the loop is unconditionally true, the only thing that needs to be stated is that the loop will continue to execute.

State: **`a` is `b`, `n` is the same value as before the conversion, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix), and the output is `n ^ l` and `l`.**
