The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them by whitespace, and converts them to integers, assigning the first integer to `a` and the second to `b`. The values of `n` and `l` are not affected by this operation. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` is `b`
- `n` is the same value as before the conversion
- `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix)
- The output is `n ^ l` and `l`

After executing the code, the new values are:
- `a` is now an integer from the input
- `b` is now an integer from the input
- `n` remains unchanged from its previous value
- `l` remains unchanged from its previous value

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `n` is the same value as before the conversion, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix), the output is `n ^ l` and `l`.**
