The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables and simply exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in this case, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is 10, `l` is 2, `a` is 9, `b` is 2**
