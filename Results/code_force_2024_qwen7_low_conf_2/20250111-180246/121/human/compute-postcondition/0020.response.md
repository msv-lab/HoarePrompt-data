Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `n` is the same value as before the conversion, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix), the output is `n ^ l` and `l`. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the if part.***
