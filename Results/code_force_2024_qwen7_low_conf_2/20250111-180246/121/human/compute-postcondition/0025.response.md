The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. Since the initial state provides that the output is 9 and 2, we can assume the input was "9 2". After this input is provided, `a` and `b` will be assigned the values 9 and 2 respectively. The values of `n` and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 10, `l` is 2, `a` is 9, `b` is 2**
