The code `print('second')` simply prints the string 'second' to the console. This does not affect the values of the variables `t` or `n`. The only thing that changes is the output to the console.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer. The binary representation of `n` has an odd number of 1s; the console outputs 'second'**
