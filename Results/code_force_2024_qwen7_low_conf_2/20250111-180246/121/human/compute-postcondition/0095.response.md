The code `break` does not change the values of any variables. It only breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. In this case, it breaks out of the loop or conditional block where `a` and `b` were assigned values from `data[index:index + 2]` and `index` was increased by 2.

Output State: **`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and they are derived from converting `data[index:index + 2]` to integers; index is increased by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
