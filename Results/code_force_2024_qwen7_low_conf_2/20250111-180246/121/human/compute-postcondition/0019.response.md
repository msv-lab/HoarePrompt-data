The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables, but it indicates that we exit the current loop or conditional block. In this case, since there are no loops or conditions being exited, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `n` is the same value as before the conversion, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix), the output is `n ^ l` and `l`.**
