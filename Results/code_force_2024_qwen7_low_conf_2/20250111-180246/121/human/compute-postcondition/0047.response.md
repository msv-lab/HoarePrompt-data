Given the provided `while True` loop and the explanation of the code execution, we need to determine the state adjustments required for the loop to execute one more time.

### Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop is `while True`, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely as long as there are no external conditions to break out of the loop.

2. **Code Execution**: 
   - The value of `n` is determined based on the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a`.
     - If the count is odd, `n = b`.
     - If the count is even, `n = a`.
   - `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` (without the '0b' prefix).
   - The code prints `n ^ l` and `l`.

Since the loop is `while True`, the loop will always execute one more time unless there is an external condition or action that breaks the loop. There are no such conditions provided in the problem statement, so we assume the loop will continue to execute indefinitely.

### State Adjustment

Since the loop is `while True`, no adjustments to the states are necessary for the loop to execute one more time. The current state remains valid for the next iteration.

### Final Answer

**State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, else `n` is `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, the printed output is `n ^ l, l`.**
