The code `print('second')` does not affect the values of any variables. It simply prints the string 'second' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is the output of the first iteration (7), `n` is an input integer, `l` is 5**
