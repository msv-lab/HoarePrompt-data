The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly in the given definition. However, based on the constraints provided, it implies that the function will handle multiple test cases where each test case has two integers: `t` and `n`. The functionality of the function is not explicitly stated in the given output cases, but we can infer that it processes these parameters according to certain rules.

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.

Since the output cases are not provided, we will focus on the input parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no direct parameters but processes test cases where each test case consists of two integers `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18).**
