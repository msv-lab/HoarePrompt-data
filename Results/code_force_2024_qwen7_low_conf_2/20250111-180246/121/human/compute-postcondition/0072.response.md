The `break` statement is used to exit a loop, but in this case, there is no loop present in the given code snippet. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement. The only impact is that the execution will exit any enclosing loop or conditional block it was inside, but since no such context is provided, we assume it's outside of any such blocks.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input, `n` is an input integer, `l` is 5, and the current value of `a` is equal to `b`.**
