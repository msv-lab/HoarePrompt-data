The code performs a bitwise XOR operation between `n` and `l`, and then prints the result followed by `l`. Since `n` is 9 and `l` is 9, the bitwise XOR operation (`n ^ l`) results in 0 because 9 XOR 9 equals 0. After printing the result, the values of `n`, `l`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 9, `l` is 9, `a` is 9, `b` is 2**
