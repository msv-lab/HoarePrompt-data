Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the condition for 'second' output based on the binary representation of `n` remains unchanged; `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, and after the execution of the if-else block, `a` is equal to `b` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken out of.***
