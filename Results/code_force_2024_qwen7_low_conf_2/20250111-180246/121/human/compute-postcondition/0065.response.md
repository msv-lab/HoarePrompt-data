The code `print('first')` simply prints the string 'first' to the console and does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, `n`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is the output of the first iteration (7), `n` is an input integer, `l` is 5**
