Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), `index` is the position where `a` and `b` were equal (or `len(data)` if the loop never executed), `a` and `b` are equal to the final value (if the loop executed), `n` is the same as `a` or `b` if the loop executed, `l` is calculated as `int(bin(n)[3:], 2)` (if the loop executed), and the last print statement outputs `n ^ l` and `l` if the loop executed.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\).
   - `data` is a list of strings obtained by splitting the input string.
   - `index` is initially 1.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs `t` times.
   - For each iteration, `n` is updated to the integer value of the element at `data[index]`, and `index` is incremented by 1.
   - A check is performed to determine whether the number of '1's in the binary representation of `n` is odd or even.
     - If odd, "second" is printed.
     - If even, "first" is printed, and further operations are performed.
   - Inside the nested `while` loop, pairs of integers (`a`, `b`) are taken from `data` and processed.
     - If `a` equals `b`, the `while` loop breaks.
     - Otherwise, `n` is updated based on the condition that the number of '1's in the binary representation of the chosen value (either `a` or `b`) is odd.
     - `l` is calculated as `int(bin(n)[3:], 2)`.
     - The expression `n ^ l` and `l` are printed.

3. **Final State:**
   - After the loop completes, `t` remains unchanged.
   - `index` points to the position where `a` and `b` were equal, or `len(data)` if the loop did not execute.
   - `a` and `b` are the final values when they become equal, or not defined if the loop did not execute.
   - `n` is the same as `a` or `b` if the loop executed.
   - `l` is calculated as `int(bin(n)[3:], 2)` if the loop executed.
   - The last print statement outputs `n ^ l` and `l` if the loop executed.

Thus, the final state reflects the conditions under which the loop completes, with the appropriate values for `t`, `index`, `a`, `b`, `n`, and `l`.
