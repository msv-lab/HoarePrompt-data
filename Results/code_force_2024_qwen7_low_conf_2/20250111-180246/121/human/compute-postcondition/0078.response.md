`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that the input is expected to be two space-separated integers, which are then converted to integers and assigned to `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is an integer from the input, `b` is an integer from the input**
