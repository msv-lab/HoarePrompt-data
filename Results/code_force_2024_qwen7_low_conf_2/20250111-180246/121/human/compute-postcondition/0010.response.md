The code reads two integers from the input using `map(int, input().split())` and assigns them to variables `a` and `b`. This means that the values of `t` and the conditions related to `n` and `l` remain unchanged. However, now `a` and `b` are assigned the values of the input integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\), the condition for 'second' output based on the binary representation of `n` remains unchanged; `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
