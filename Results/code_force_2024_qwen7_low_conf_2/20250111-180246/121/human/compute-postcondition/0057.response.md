Postcondition: ***`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer. If `a` equals `b`, then `n` is set to `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd; otherwise, `n` is set to `a`. `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. If `a` does not equal `b`, the conditions remain unchanged.***
