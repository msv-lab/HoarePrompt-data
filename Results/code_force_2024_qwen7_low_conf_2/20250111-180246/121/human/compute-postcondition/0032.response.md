Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `a` and `b` are equal.
  - `n` is the last value of `n` used before the loop broke.
  - `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`.

- **For Loop Statement:**
  ```python
  for _ in range(int(input())):
      # the loop body is omitted
  ```

### Analysis:
1. **Input and Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is based on `int(input())`.
   - This means that the number of iterations of the loop will depend on the input provided when the loop starts.
   - If the user provides an input `k`, the loop will run `k` times.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - Since the loop is running based on the input, the state does not change within the loop body (the loop body is omitted).
   - The only thing that changes is the number of iterations the loop will perform based on the input.

3. **Starting State for the Next Iteration:**
   - To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the input provided.
   - Let's assume the user inputs `k` for the next iteration.
   - After each iteration, the loop will decrement `k` by 1 until it reaches 0.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` and `b` are equal.
   - `n` is the last value of `n` used before the loop broke.
   - `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`.

2. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the user needs to provide an input `k` such that the loop will run for another iteration.
   - Let's say the user inputs `k = 1` for the next iteration.

### Adjusted State:
- Since the loop is running based on the input, the state remains the same as the initial state, but the loop counter `k` is decremented by 1.
- Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will still be:
  - `a` and `b` are equal.
  - `n` is the last value of `n` used before the loop broke.
  - `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`.

However, since the loop is based on the input, we should note that the loop will run one more time if the input is provided.

### Final Answer:
State: **`a` and `b` are equal, `n` is the last value of `n` used before the loop broke, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`**.

This is the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
