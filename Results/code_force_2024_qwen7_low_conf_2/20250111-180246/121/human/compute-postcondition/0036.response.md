The code `l = int(bin(n)[3:], 2)` converts the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix) starting from the fourth character to an integer. Let's break this down:

1. `bin(n)` converts the integer `n` to its binary string representation, e.g., `bin(5)` results in `'0b101'`.
2. `bin(n)[3:]` slices the string to remove the first three characters ('0b'), resulting in the binary digits without the prefix, e.g., `'101'`.
3. `int(..., 2)` converts the sliced binary string to an integer with base 2.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are equal.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`, excluding the first two characters after the '0b'.
- The string 'first' is printed to the console.

After executing the code:
- `l` is updated to the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`a` and `b` are equal, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character, and the string 'first' is printed to the console.**
