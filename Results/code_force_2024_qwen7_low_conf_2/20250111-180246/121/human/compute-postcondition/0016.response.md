`n` and `l` are defined such that `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix). The code performs a bitwise XOR operation between `n` and `l`, and then prints the result of this operation along with `l`. Since no new variables are introduced and the values of `a` and `b` are not directly affected by this code, their states remain unchanged.

Let's denote the binary representation of `n` as `bin_n`. Thus, `l` is the integer value of `bin_n` without the '0b' prefix.

The bitwise XOR operation `n ^ l` will compare each bit of `n` and `l`. If the bits are the same, the result is 0; if they are different, the result is 1. Given that `l` is the integer value of `bin_n`, `n ^ l` will flip all the bits of `n`.

After the print statement, the output will be the result of `n ^ l` followed by `l`.

Output State: **`a` is `b`, `n` is the same value as before the conversion, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` (excluding the '0b' prefix), and the output is `n ^ l` and `l`.**
