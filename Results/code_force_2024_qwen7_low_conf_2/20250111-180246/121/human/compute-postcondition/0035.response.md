The code `print('first')` prints the string 'first' to the console but does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are equal, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`, and the string 'first' is printed to the console.**
