The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly listed in the given code snippet. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems the function should handle multiple test cases, where each test case involves two integers: `t` and `n`. 

Given the constraints:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 1000.
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18.

Since the function signature only shows `def func():`, it implies that the function should process a series of test cases where `t` and `n` are provided, but these parameters are not explicitly defined within the function itself.

Output:
Case_1: The function processes a test case with `t` and `n` as described above and returns a result based on the values of `t` and `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process a series of test cases where each test case includes an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), and then return a result based on these values.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each including an integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 1000) and an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18), and returns a result based on these values.**
