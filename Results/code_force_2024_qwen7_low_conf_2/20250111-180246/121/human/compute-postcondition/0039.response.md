To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while True` loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given conditions and the loop itself.

### Given States Before the Loop
- `a` and `b` are equal.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`.
- If `bin(n).count('1')` is odd, 'second' is printed.
- Otherwise, `n ^ l` and `l` are printed to the console.

### Analysis of the Loop
The loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly stopped. Therefore, no adjustments to the states are necessary to make the loop execute one more time because the loop will always continue as long as it is not broken out of.

### Conclusion
Since the `while True` loop will always execute as long as it is not interrupted, no adjustments to the states are required to allow the loop to proceed to its first iteration.

### Final Answer
State: **`a` is equal to `b`, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n`, if `bin(n).count('1')` is odd, 'second' is printed, otherwise `n ^ l` and `l` are printed to the console**
