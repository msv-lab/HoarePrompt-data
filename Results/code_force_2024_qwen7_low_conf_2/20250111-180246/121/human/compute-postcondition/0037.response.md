Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is defined as follows:
   - `a` and `b` are equal.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character.
   - The string 'first' is printed to the console.

2. The code snippet provided is:
   ```python
   print(n ^ l, l)
   ```

3. Let's break down what this code does:
   - `l` is already defined as the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character.
   - `n ^ l` computes the bitwise XOR of `n` and `l`.
   - Both `n ^ l` and `l` are then printed to the console.

4. Since the code only prints values and does not assign them back to any variables, the variables `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged. The value of `l` remains the same, and the print statement executes, outputting `n ^ l` and `l`.

5. The output state after executing the code is:
   - `a` and `b` are equal.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character.
   - The string 'first' was printed to the console (though this is not included in the final state).
   - `n ^ l` and `l` are printed to the console.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are equal, `n` is the input integer, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` starting from the third character, and `n ^ l` and `l` are printed to the console.**
