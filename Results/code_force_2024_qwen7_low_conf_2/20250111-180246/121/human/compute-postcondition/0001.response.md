The code assigns the value of `int(input())` to `n`. Since `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\) before the code is executed, the only change is that `n` will now hold the value of the user input converted to an integer. The value of `t` remains within its original range but is no longer directly used in the code. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 1000\); `n` is an input integer**
