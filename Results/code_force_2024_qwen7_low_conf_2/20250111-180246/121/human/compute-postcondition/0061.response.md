Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `n` is the last value assigned to `b` if the count of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, else `n` is the last value assigned to `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary representation of `n` without the '0b' prefix, the printed output is `n ^ l, l`.**
