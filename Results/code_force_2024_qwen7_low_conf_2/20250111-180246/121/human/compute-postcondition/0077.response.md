Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is `b` if the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a` is odd, else `n` is `a`.
   - `l` is the integer value of the binary string starting from the 3rd character of the binary representation of `n`.
   - The output is `n ^ l, l`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop is a `while True` loop, meaning it will continue to execute indefinitely unless explicitly broken out of.

3. **What Needs to Be Adjusted**:
   - Since the loop is `while True`, it will always execute again unless there is an explicit break condition inside the loop. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states for the loop to execute one more time.

Given this analysis, the state at the end of the previous iteration does not need to be modified for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

**State: **No modifications needed.**
