Postcondition: ***`a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and they are derived from converting `data[index:index + 2]` to integers; index is increased by 2. If `a` equals `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a` does not equal `b`, no specific action is taken regarding the variables' values, but index is still increased by 2.***
