According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as there are no explicit conditions to break out of it. Since there are no conditions given in the loop itself to determine when to stop, the loop can certainly execute one more time without needing to adjust any states based on the conditions inside the loop.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration: `n` is 10, `l` is 2, and the output is 9 and 2, we do not need to modify any of these states for the loop to proceed to the next iteration.

State: **`n` is 10, `l` is 2, and the output is 9 and 2**
