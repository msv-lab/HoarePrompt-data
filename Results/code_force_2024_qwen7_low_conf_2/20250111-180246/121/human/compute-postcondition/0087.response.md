Postcondition: ***`a` is `x`, `b` is `y`, `n` is the number of '1's in the binary representation of `a`, `l` is the integer value of the binary string of `n`, and if `a` equals `b`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Since there is no else part, the function does nothing else.***
