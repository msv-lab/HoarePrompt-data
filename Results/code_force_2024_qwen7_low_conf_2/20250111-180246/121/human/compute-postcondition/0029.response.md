The code `l = int(bin(n)[3:], 2)` impacts the variable `l`. Initially, `n` is 9, which in binary is `0b1001`. The slice `[3:]` removes the first three characters (`0b1`) leaving `1001`. The `int()` function then converts this binary string back to an integer with base 2, resulting in `9`.

So, after executing the code, `l` is assigned the value `9`.

Output State: **`n` is 9, `l` is 9, `a` is 9, `b` is 2**
