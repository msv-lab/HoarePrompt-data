The function `func_2` accepts a list of strings `arr`, where each string represents an integer in the range [1, 10^9]. It iterates through the list to find a string ending with '0' and having the maximum value according to the helper function `func_1`. If such a string is found, it updates this string by reversing it (converting it to an integer, reversing it, and then converting it back to a string). If no such string exists, the list and the boolean flag `found` remain unchanged. The function returns the modified list `arr` and the boolean flag `found` indicating whether a suitable string was found and updated.
