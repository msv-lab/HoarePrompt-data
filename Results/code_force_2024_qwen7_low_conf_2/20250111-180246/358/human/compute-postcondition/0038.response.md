The code `n, m = map(int, input().split())` takes two integers as input separated by a space and assigns them to the variables `n` and `m`. The initial state values for `t`, `n`, `a`, `len_arr`, `zrr`, and `ans` are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings that must have at least `n` elements, `len_arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `zrr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order that must have at least `n` elements, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`**.
