The code `ans += len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` updates the value of `ans` by adding `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` to its current value. Here, `i` is not specified, but since it's part of the initial conditions, we can infer that `i` refers to the last index `n-1` as per the initial conditions.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer decremented by 1
- `n` is an input integer
- `m` is the second integer input
- `a` is a list of strings
- `len_arr` is a list of lengths of strings in `a` where `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`
- `zrr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is updated to be `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`
- `ans` is increased by `len_arr[n-1] - zrr[n-1]`

Let's calculate the new value of `ans`:

1. From the initial conditions, `ans` is already increased by `len_arr[n-1] - zrr[n-1]`.
2. Now, the code adds `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` to `ans`. Since `i` is not specified but we know from the context that it should be `n-1`, we add `len_arr[n-1] - zrr[n-1]` again to `ans`.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` is:
\[ \text{new\_ans} = \text{ans} + (\text{len\_arr}[n-1] - \text{zrr}[n-1]) \]

Since the exact value of `ans` before this line is not given, we only know the increment operation.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of lengths of strings in `a` where `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is updated to be `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[n-1] - zrr[n-1]` and then added with `len_arr[n-1] - zrr[n-1]`**
