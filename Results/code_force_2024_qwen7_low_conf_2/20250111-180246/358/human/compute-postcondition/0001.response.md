According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will execute as long as `t` is a positive integer within the specified range (1 <= t <= 10^4). 

Before the loop starts, the state is given as `t` being an input integer, but we need to ensure that this integer falls within the required range for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an input integer that must satisfy 1 <= t <= 10^4**
