Output State: **`t` is `t - n` and is greater than 0, `n` is a specific integer, `m` is a specific integer, `a` is a list of strings based on the input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the length of the corresponding string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` in range `n`.**
