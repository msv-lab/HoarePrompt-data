The code updates the value of `len_arr[i]` to be the length of `a[i]`. Since `len_arr[i]` was previously set to the length of `a[i]`, this assignment does not change its value. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `len_arr[i + 1]` is the length of `a[i + 1]`; `zrr[i + 1]` is `len(a[i + 1]) - len(a[i + 1].rstrip('0'))`; `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`; `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`; `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))**
