Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-empty list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order. `ans` is the sum of elements at indices where `i` is odd in the list `zrr`.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = n-1` in steps of 1. The loop body adds `zrr[i]` to `ans` only when `i % 2 != 0` (i.e., `i` is odd).

2. **Final Value of `i`**: After `n` iterations, `i` will be equal to `n`.

3. **Variable `ans`**: `ans` accumulates the sum of `zrr[i]` for all odd `i` from `0` to `n-1`. This means `ans` will be the sum of `zrr[i]` where `i` is an odd number between `0` and `n-1`.

4. **Other Variables**: 
   - `n`: Must be a positive integer since the loop condition depends on `n > 0`.
   - `a`: Is a non-empty list of strings.
   - `len_arr`: Is a list of `n` integers representing the lengths of strings in `a`.
   - `zrr`: Is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, representing the differences between the lengths of strings in `a` and their stripped lengths.

Since the loop runs for `n` iterations, the final state will reflect these conditions and the accumulated value of `ans`.
