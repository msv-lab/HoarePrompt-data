Postcondition: **`t` is an input integer decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of lengths of strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1` plus the sum of `zrr[i]` where `i` is odd (i.e., `i % 2 != 0`), and `ans - 1 < m`**
