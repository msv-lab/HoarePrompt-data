`ans` is incremented by the value of `zrr[i]`. The value of `i` is specified to be an odd integer, and `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order. The state of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `len_arr`) remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an odd integer, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is `ans` + `zrr[i]`**
