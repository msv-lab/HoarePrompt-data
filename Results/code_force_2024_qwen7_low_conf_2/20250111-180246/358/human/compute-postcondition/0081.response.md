The code assigns the value of `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` to `zrr[i]`. Here, `len(a[i])` is the length of the string `a[i]`, and `len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` is the length of the string `a[i]` after removing trailing zeros. 

From the initial state, we know that `t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`. However, the specific values of these variables are not given, so we will express the new value of `zrr[i]` in terms of the original lengths.

Let's denote:
- `len_a_i` as `len(a[i])`
- `len_a_i_trailing_zeros_removed` as `len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`

Then, `zrr[i]` is set to `len_a_i - len_a_i_trailing_zeros_removed`.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `len_a_i` and `len_a_i_trailing_zeros_removed`, we will keep them in their symbolic form.

The output state is:
Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`, `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`**
