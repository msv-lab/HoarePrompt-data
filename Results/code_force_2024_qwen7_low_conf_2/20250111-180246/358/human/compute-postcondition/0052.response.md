The code updates the value of `len_arr[i]` to be the length of the string at index `i` in the list `a`. Let's analyze the impact on the variables:

1. `len_arr[i]` is updated to be the length of `a[i]`.
2. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `zrr`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

To provide the specific values, we need to know the value of `i`. Since `i` is not specified, let's denote it as `i`.

The updated state will be:
- `len_arr[i]` is now the length of `a[i]`.
- All other variables retain their original values from the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an input integer decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of lengths of strings in `a` where `len_arr[i]` is now the length of `a[i]`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the difference between the length of the corresponding element in `a` and the length of that element stripped of trailing zeros, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[n-1] - zrr[n-1]`**.
