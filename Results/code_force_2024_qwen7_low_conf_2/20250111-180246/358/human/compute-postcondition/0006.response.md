The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `ans`. This does not affect the values of the other variables, which remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings from the input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0.**
