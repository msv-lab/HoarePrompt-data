Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-empty list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order. `ans` is the sum of elements at indices where `i` is odd in the list `zrr`. The condition `ans - 1 >= m` is satisfied.***
