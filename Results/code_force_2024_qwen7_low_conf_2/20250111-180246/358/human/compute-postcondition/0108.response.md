Postcondition: ***`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-empty list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of elements at indices where `i` is odd in the list `zrr`. If `ans - 1 >= m`, the function does nothing. Otherwise, the string 'Anna' is printed to the console.***
