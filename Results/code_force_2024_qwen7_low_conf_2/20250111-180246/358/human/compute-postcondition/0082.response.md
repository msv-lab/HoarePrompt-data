`ans` is assigned the value of `ans + (len_arr[i] - zrr[i])`. The value of `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`, and `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`. The initial state tells us that `t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, and both `len_arr[i]` and `zrr[i]` are defined as above. The value of `ans` is updated by adding `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` to its current value.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`, `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`**
