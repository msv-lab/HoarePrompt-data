Let's go through the code step by step:

- Initial State: 
  - `t` is an input integer decremented by 1 (`t = input_integer - 1`)
  - `n` is an input integer (and `n > 0`)
  - `m` is the second integer input
  - `a` is a list of strings obtained from splitting an input
  - `len_arr` is a list containing the lengths of the strings in `a`
  - `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros
  - `ans` is 0

- Code Execution:
  ```python
  zrr[i] = len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))
  ```

  - This line sets the `i`-th element of `zrr` to the difference between the length of the `i`-th element of `a` and the length of the `i`-th element of `a` stripped of trailing zeros.

  - Here, `i` is a valid index within the range `[0, n-1]`.

  - For each valid `i`, the `i`-th element of `zrr` is updated to the computed value.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of lengths of strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the difference between the length of the corresponding element in `a` and the length of that element stripped of trailing zeros, `ans` is 0**
