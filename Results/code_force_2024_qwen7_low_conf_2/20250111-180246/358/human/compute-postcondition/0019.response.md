Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings from the input, `len_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the length of the corresponding string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of integers where each element is the number of trailing zeros in the corresponding string in `a`, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.**
