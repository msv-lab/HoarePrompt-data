The code updates the variable `ans` by adding the value of `zrr[i]`. Since `i` is odd, it means `i` was even during the previous iteration, which would mean `ans` was not updated in the previous iteration. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans`. The value of `ans` is now `ans + zrr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `len_arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `zrr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order that must have at least `n` elements, `i` is odd, and `ans` is equal to `ans + zrr[i]`.**
