Output State: **`t` is an input integer decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of lengths of strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the difference between the length of the corresponding element in `a` and the length of that element stripped of trailing zeros, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.**
