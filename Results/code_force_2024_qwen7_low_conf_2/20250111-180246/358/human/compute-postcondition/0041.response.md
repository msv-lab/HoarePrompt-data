The code initializes `zrr` as a list of `n` zeros. This means that `zrr` is updated to a list containing `n` zeros. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings that now contains the split input values, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`.**
