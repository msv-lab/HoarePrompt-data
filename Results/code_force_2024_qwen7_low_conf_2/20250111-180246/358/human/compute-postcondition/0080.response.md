The code `len_arr[i] = len(a[i])` assigns the length of the list `a[i]` to the element `len_arr[i]`. However, the initial state does not provide specific values for `len_arr` and `a`, only that `t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0, and `n` must be greater than 0. The variables `len_arr` and `a` are not mentioned in the initial state, so their values are unknown. The value of `i` is also not specified.

Since no specific values are given for `len_arr`, `a`, or `i`, the only change is that `len_arr[i]` now holds the length of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`**
