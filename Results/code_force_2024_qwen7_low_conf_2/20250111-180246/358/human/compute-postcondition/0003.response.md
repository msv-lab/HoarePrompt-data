The code `a = list(map(str, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters, and then converts each string to a string (which is redundant but doesn't change the content). The values of `t`, `n`, and `m` are not affected by this code. The output state will reflect that `a` is now a list containing the input strings.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must satisfy 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings from the input**
