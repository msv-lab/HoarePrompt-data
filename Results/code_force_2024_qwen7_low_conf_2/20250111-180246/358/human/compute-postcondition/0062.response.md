The code `ans += zrr[i]` adds the value of `zrr[i]` to `ans`. Given that `i` is 3, this means `ans` is updated by adding the value of `zrr[3]` to its current value. The other variables remain unchanged.

The initial state is:
- `t` is an input integer decremented by 1
- `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0
- `m` is the second integer input
- `a` is a list of strings
- `len_arr` is a list of lengths of strings in `a`
- `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order
- `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1` plus `zrr[1]`
- `i` is 3

After executing `ans += zrr[i]`, `ans` is updated to its current value plus `zrr[3]`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of lengths of strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1` plus `zrr[1]` plus `zrr[3]`, `i` is 3**
