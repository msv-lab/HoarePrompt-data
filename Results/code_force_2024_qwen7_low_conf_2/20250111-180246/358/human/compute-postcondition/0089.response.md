The code `zrr[i] = len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))` does not affect any new variables but updates the value of `zrr[i]`. Given that `zrr[i]` was previously defined as `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`, this line simply reassigns the same expression to `zrr[i]`, which means the value of `zrr[i]` remains unchanged.

The states of other variables (`t`, `n`, `len_arr[i]`, `ans`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `len_arr[i + 1]` is the length of `a[i + 1]`; `zrr[i + 1]` is `len(a[i + 1]) - len(a[i + 1].rstrip('0'))`; `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`; `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`; `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))**
