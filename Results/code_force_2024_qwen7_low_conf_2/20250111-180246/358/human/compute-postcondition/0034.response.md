Postcondition: `t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings from the input that must have at least `n` elements, `len_arr` is a list of integers that must have at least `n` elements, `zrr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order that must have at least `n` elements, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]` where `i` is even.
