Postcondition: ***`i` is an odd integer, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order. If `i` is an odd integer, `ans` is updated by adding `zrr[i]` to its current value. Since there is no else part, the other variables (`n`, `a`, `len_arr`, `zrr`) remain unchanged.***
