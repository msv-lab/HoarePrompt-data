Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop involves the variable `i`, which ranges from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Determine the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. This means `i` starts at `0` and increments until it reaches `n-1`.

3. **Initial Values of Variables**:
   - `t`: An input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4).
   - `n`: An input integer.
   - `m`: An input integer.
   - `a`: A list of strings from the input.
   - `len_arr`: A list of `n` zeros.
   - `zrr`: A list of `n` zeros.
   - `ans`: 0.

4. **State Adjustment for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will start with `i = 0` and will continue as long as `i < n`.
   - To ensure the loop executes, `n` must be at least `1`.

5. **Other Variables**:
   - `a`, `len_arr`, `zrr`, and `ans` do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given code snippet.

Given this analysis, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0 (i.e., `n > 0`).

**Final State**:
State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings from the input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0.**
