The code initializes a new list `zrr` with `n` elements, each set to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must satisfy 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings from the input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros.**
