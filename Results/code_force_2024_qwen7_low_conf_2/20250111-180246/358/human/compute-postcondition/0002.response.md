`t` is an input integer that must satisfy 1 <= t <= 10^4, and the code reads two integers from input and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The values of `t` and `n`, `m` are dependent on the user's input. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated values of `n` and `m` along with the unchanged value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must satisfy 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer**
