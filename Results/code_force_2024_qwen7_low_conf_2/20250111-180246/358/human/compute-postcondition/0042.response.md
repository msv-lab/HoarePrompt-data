The code `ans = 0` simply assigns the value 0 to the variable `ans`. This does not affect any other variables or their states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is decremented by 1, `n` is the first integer input, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings that now contains the split input values, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, and `ans` is 0.**
