`ans` is incremented by `zrr[i]`. Since `i` is an even integer and `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `zrr[i]` is the integer at index `i` in `zrr`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `n`, `a`, `len_arr`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is an even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is `ans + zrr[i]`**
