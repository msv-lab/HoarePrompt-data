The code updates the value of `zrr[i]` based on the lengths of the strings in `a`. Specifically, `zrr[i]` is set to the difference between the length of the string `a[i]` and the length of `a[i]` after stripping trailing zeros (`a[i].rstrip('0')`). This means that `zrr[i]` will hold the number of trailing zeros in the string `a[i]`.

Let's break down the impact:

- `t` remains an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4).
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `m` remains an input integer.
- `a` remains a list of strings from the input.
- `len_arr` remains a list of `n` integers where each element is the length of the corresponding string in `a`.
- `zrr` is updated such that for each index `i`, `zrr[i]` is now equal to `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings from the input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the length of the corresponding string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the number of trailing zeros in the corresponding string in `a`, `ans` is 0.**
