The code `print('Anna')` prints the string 'Anna' to the console. This does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a non-empty list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of elements at indices where `i` is odd in the list `zrr`, and `ans - 1 < m`. The string 'Anna' is printed to the console.**
