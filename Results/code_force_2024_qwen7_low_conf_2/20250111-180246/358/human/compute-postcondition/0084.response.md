The code `len_arr[i] = len(a[i])` assigns the length of the list `a[i]` to the variable `len_arr[i]`. According to the initial state, `len_arr[i + 1]` is the length of `a[i + 1]`, and `zrr[i + 1]` is `len(a[i + 1]) - len(a[i + 1].rstrip('0'))`. The value of `len_arr[i]` is now the length of `a[i]`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `len_arr[i + 1]` is the length of `a[i + 1]`, `zrr[i + 1]` is `len(a[i + 1]) - len(a[i + 1].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i + 1] - zrr[i + 1]`, `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`**
