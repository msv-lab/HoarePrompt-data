The code initializes a list `len_arr` with `n` elements, each set to 0. This does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `m`, or the list `a`. Therefore, the only change is in the new list `len_arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer that must satisfy 1 <= t <= 10^4, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings from the input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros**
