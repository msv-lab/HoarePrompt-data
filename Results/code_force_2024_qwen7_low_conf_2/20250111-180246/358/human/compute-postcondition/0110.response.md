The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but processes a set of test cases. Each test case includes:
- A positive integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each of the `t` test cases, two integers `n` and `m` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\) and \(0 \leq m \leq 2 \times 10^6\).
- A list `a` containing `n` integers such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\) for all elements \(a_i\) in the list.

Based on the given conditions, the function will process these inputs and return different outputs depending on the specific logic implemented within the function body.

Functionality: **The function processes `t` test cases, where for each test case it accepts integers `t`, `n`, `m`, and a list `a` of `n` integers, and returns varying outputs based on the internal logic.**
