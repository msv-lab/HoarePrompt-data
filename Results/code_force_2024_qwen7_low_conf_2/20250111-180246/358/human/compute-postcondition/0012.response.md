The code `len_arr[i] = len(a[i])` calculates the length of the string at index `i` in the list `a` and assigns it to the `i`-th element of the list `len_arr`. This means that the length of each string in `a` is being computed and stored in `len_arr`. 

Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of integers representing the lengths of these strings, and `zrr` is a list of integers representing the number of trailing zeros in the corresponding strings, the code does not affect `n`, `m`, `a`, `zrr`, or `ans`. It only updates `len_arr`.

Let's summarize the changes:

- The length of each string in `a` is now stored in `len_arr` at the corresponding index.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `a` is a list of strings from the input, `len_arr` is a list of integers where each element is the length of the corresponding string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the number of trailing zeros in the corresponding string in `a`, `ans` is `ans + (len_arr[current_i + 1] - zrr[current_i + 1])` and `len_arr[i]` is updated to be the length of `a[i]` for each `i`**.
