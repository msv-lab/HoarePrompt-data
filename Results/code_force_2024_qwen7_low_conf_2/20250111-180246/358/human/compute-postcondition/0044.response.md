The code assigns the length of each string in the list `a` to the corresponding index in the list `len_arr`. Since `a` is a list of strings and `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, the value of `len_arr[i]` will be updated to the length of `a[i]` for each `i` in the range of `n`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is decremented by 1.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is the second integer input.
- `a` is a list of strings that now contains the split input values.
- `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `ans` is 0.

After the code execution, the `len_arr` list will be updated with the lengths of the strings in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings that now contains the split input values, `len_arr` is updated with the lengths of the strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0**
