`ans` is assigned the value `0`. The initial value of `ans` was the sum of `len_arr[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`. Since now `ans` is set to `0`, the sum of `len_arr[i]` is no longer relevant. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0, `n` is a specific integer, `m` is a specific integer, `a` is a list of strings based on the input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `0`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0, `n` is a specific integer, `m` is a specific integer, `a` is a list of strings based on the input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is `0`**
