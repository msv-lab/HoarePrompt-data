According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`.
- `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))`.
- `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < n` must still hold true. Since `i` is incremented at each iteration, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`. Therefore, `i + 1` must be less than `n`. 

Given that `i` was the maximum value that satisfied `i < n` in the previous iteration, the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`. 

Let's summarize the updated states:

- `t` remains as `t - 1` and is greater than 0.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `len_arr[i + 1]` is the length of `a[i + 1]`.
- `zrr[i + 1]` is `len(a[i + 1]) - len(a[i + 1].rstrip('0'))`.
- `ans` will be increased by `len_arr[i + 1] - zrr[i + 1]`.

State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `len_arr[i + 1]` is the length of `a[i + 1]`, `zrr[i + 1]` is `len(a[i + 1]) - len(a[i + 1].rstrip('0'))`, `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i + 1] - zrr[i + 1]`**
