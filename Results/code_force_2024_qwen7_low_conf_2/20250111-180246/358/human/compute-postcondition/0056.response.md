The code `zrr.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `zrr` in descending order. The values of `t`, `n`, `m`, `a`, `len_arr`, and `ans` are not affected by this operation.

After sorting `zrr` in descending order, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an input integer decremented by 1, `n` is an input integer, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of lengths of strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order, `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1`.**
