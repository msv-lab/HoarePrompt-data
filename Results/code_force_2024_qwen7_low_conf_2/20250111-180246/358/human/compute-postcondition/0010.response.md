`ans` is incremented by the difference between `len_arr[i]` and `zrr[i]`. The value of `i` is not specified, so we cannot determine the exact value of `ans` without knowing the values of `len_arr[i]` and `zrr[i]`. However, we know that `len_arr` and `zrr` are lists of `n` integers, and `i` is an index within the range of these lists.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings from the input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the length of the corresponding string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the number of trailing zeros in the corresponding string in `a`, `ans` is `ans + (len_arr[i] - zrr[i])`**
