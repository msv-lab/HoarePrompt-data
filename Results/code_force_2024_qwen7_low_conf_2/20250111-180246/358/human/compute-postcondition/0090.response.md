The code `ans += len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` increments `ans` by the value of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`. Given the initial state, `ans` is already increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for the current `i`. This means that the value of `ans` is further increased by the same amount.

Therefore, the new value of `ans` will be the previous value of `ans` plus `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]`.

Output State: **`t` is `t - 1` and is greater than 0; `n` is greater than 0; `len_arr[i + 1]` is the length of `a[i + 1]`; `zrr[i + 1]` is `len(a[i + 1]) - len(a[i + 1].rstrip('0'))`; `ans` is increased by `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` again; `len_arr[i]` is the length of `a[i]`; `zrr[i]` is `len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))**
