Postcondition: ***`i` is an even integer, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a non-empty list of strings, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers, `zrr` is a list of `n` integers sorted in descending order. Since `i` is an even integer, the if condition `i % 2 != 0` is false, thus the else part is executed and `ans` is updated to `ans + zrr[i]`.***
