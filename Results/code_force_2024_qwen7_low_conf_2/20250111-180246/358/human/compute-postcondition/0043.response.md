According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute if `n` is at least 1. Here are the initial states provided:

- `t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is decremented by 1.
- `n` is the first integer input.
- `m` is the second integer input.
- `a` is a list of strings that now contains the split input values.
- `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros.
- `ans` is 0.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to make sure that `n` is greater than 0. All other variables (`t`, `m`, `a`, `len_arr`, `zrr`, and `ans`) do not directly affect whether the loop can execute, but they may be relevant for subsequent operations within the loop.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4) and is decremented by 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is the second integer input, `a` is a list of strings that now contains the split input values, `len_arr` is a list of `n` zeros, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0**
