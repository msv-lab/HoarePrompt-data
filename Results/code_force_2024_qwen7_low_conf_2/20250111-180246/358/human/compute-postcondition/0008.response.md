`len_arr[i]` is assigned the length of the string `a[i]`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so let's denote it as `i`. Since `a` is a list of strings, `len(a[i])` will be an integer representing the length of the `i-th` string in the list `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings from the input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the length of the corresponding string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0.

Output State: **`t` is an input integer (1 <= t <= 10^4), `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer; `a` is a list of strings from the input, `len_arr` is a list of `n` integers where each element is the length of the corresponding string in `a`, `zrr` is a list of `n` zeros, `ans` is 0.**
