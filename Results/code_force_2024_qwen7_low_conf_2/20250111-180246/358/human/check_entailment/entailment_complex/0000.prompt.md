You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Sasha gave Anna a list a of n integers for Valentine's Day. Anna doesn't need
this list, so she suggests destroying it by playing a game.

Players take turns. Sasha is a gentleman, so he gives Anna the right to make
the first move.

  * On her turn, Anna must choose an element a_i from the list and reverse the sequence of its digits. For example, if Anna chose the element with a value of 42 , it would become 24 ; if Anna chose the element with a value of 1580 , it would become 851 . Note that leading zeros are removed. After such a turn, the number of elements in the list does not change.
  * On his turn, Sasha must extract two elements a_i and a_j (i \ne j ) from the list, concatenate them in any order and insert the result back into the list. For example, if Sasha chose the elements equal to 2007 and 19 , he would remove these two elements from the list and add the integer 200719 or 192007 . After such a turn, the number of elements in the list decreases by 1 .

Players can't skip turns. The game ends when Sasha can't make a move, i.e.
after Anna's move there is exactly one number left in the list. If this
integer is not less than 10^m (i.e., \ge 10^m ), Sasha wins. Otherwise, Anna
wins.

It can be shown that the game will always end. Determine who will win if both
players play optimally.

Input

The first line contains an integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

Then follows the description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains integers n , m (1 \le n \le 2 \cdot
10^5 , 0 \le m \le 2 \cdot 10^6 ) — the number of integers in the list and the
parameter determining when Sasha wins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the list that Sasha gave to Anna.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output:

  * "Sasha", if Sasha wins with optimal play; 
  * "Anna", if Anna wins with optimal play.

Note

Consider the first test case.

Anna can reverse the integer 2 , then Sasha can concatenate the integers 2 and
14 , obtaining the integer 214 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . If Anna
had reversed the integer 14 , Sasha would have concatenated the integers 41
and 2 , obtaining the integer 412 , which is greater than 10^2 = 100 . Anna
has no other possible moves, so she loses.

# Annotated Program:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4; for each test case, n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 2 * 10^5 and 0 <= m <= 2 * 10^6; the list a contains n integers such that 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for all elements a_i in the list.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, m = map(int, input().split())
        
        a = list(map(str, input().split()))
        
        len_arr = [0] * n
        
        zrr = [0] * n
        
        ans = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            len_arr[i] = len(a[i])
            zrr[i] = len(a[i]) - len(a[i].rstrip('0'))
            ans += len_arr[i] - zrr[i]
        
        zrr.sort(reverse=True)
        
        for i in range(n):
            if i % 2 != 0:
                ans += zrr[i]
        
        if ans - 1 >= m:
            print('Sasha')
        else:
            print('Anna')
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer (1), `n` is the largest integer `n` provided in any of the inputs, `m` is the largest integer `m` provided in any of the inputs, `a` is a list of strings with the maximum length of `n`, `len_arr` is a list of integers containing the lengths of the strings in `a`, `zrr` is a list of integers sorted in descending order containing the differences between the lengths of the strings and the lengths of the strings after stripping trailing zeros, and `ans` is the sum of `len_arr[i] - zrr[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, n-1]`, plus the sum of `zrr[i]` where `i` is odd. If `ans - 1 >= m`, the function prints 'Sasha'. Otherwise, it prints 'Anna'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes `t` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `m`, and a list `a` of `n` space-separated strings, where each string consists of digits. It calculates the sum of the lengths of these strings after removing trailing zeros (`ans`). Then, it sorts the differences between the original lengths and the lengths after removing trailing zeros in descending order (`zrr`). Finally, it adds the values in `zrr` corresponding to odd indices to `ans`. Based on whether `ans - 1` is greater than or equal to `m`, the function prints either 'Sasha' or 'Anna'. The function handles the following edge cases:
1. The input list `a` can contain empty strings, which are treated as having zero length after removing trailing zeros.
2. The input `m` can be zero, and the function still calculates and compares `ans - 1` with `m`.
3. The function correctly processes multiple test cases sequentially, ensuring that each test case is independent of the others.
