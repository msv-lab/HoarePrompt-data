Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the game rules. Specifically, the program does not simulate the game process but rather calculates some values based on the input. The program does not handle the actual turns of Anna and Sasha, nor does it simulate the concatenation and removal of elements as described in the problem statement. Therefore, it cannot determine the winner based on the optimal play strategy as required.
