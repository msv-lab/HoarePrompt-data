The function `func_3` accepts a parameter `arr`, which is a list of strings representing integers. It returns the modified list `arr` where the first element remains unchanged, the second element is the string whose last character is '0' and `func_1(second element)` is greater than `func_1(first element)`, and `idx1` is the index of this second element. If no such element is found, `idx1` is `0` and the second element remains the same as the first. Additionally, the function ensures that the element with the '0' suffix is combined with another element based on certain conditions. Specifically, if an appropriate second element is found, it is combined with the first element. If no such element is found, the first and second elements are combined under specific conditions involving the lengths of the strings. The function handles cases where no suitable second element is found by performing alternative combinations and removals to ensure the final state adheres to the given postconditions.
