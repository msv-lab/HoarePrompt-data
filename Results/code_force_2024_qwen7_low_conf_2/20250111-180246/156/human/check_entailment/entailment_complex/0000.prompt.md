First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
[Maître Gims - Est-ce que tu m'aimes ?](https://youtu.be/6TpyRE_juyA)

ඞ

As the CEO of a startup company, you want to reward each of your k employees
with a ticket to the upcoming concert. The tickets will be on sale for n days,
and by some time travelling, you have predicted that the price per ticket at
day i will be a_i . However, to prevent ticket hoarding, the concert
organizers have implemented the following measures:

  * A person may purchase no more than m tickets per day. 
  * If a person purchases x tickets on day i , all subsequent days (i.e. from day i+1 onwards) will have their prices per ticket increased by x . 

For example, if a = [1, 3, 8, 4, 5] and you purchase 2 tickets on day 1 , they
will cost 2 in total, and the prices from day 2 onwards will become [5, 10, 6,
7] . If you then purchase 3 more tickets on day 2 , they will cost in total an
additional 15 , and the prices from day 3 onwards will become [13, 9, 10] .

Find the minimum spending to purchase k tickets.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains an integer t
(1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of the test
cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n , m , and k (1 \le
n \le 3 \cdot 10^5, 1 \le m \le 10^9, 1 \le k \le \min(nm, 10^9) ) — the
number of sale days, the maximum amount of ticket purchasable each day, and
the number of tickets to be bought at the end.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the price per ticket for each of the upcoming n days.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 3 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer: the minimum amount of money needed to
purchase exactly k tickets.

    5 5 5 5 5 5

Output

    10

    72
    
Note

In the first test case, one optimal way to buy 3 tickets is as follows:

  * Buy 0 tickets on the first day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [6, 4, 2] . 
  * Buy 0 tickets on the second day. The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [4, 2] . 
  * Buy 1 ticket on the third day with cost 4 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [3] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 6 . 

In the second test case, there is only one way to buy 8 tickets:

  * Buy 2 tickets on the first day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6, 4] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the second day with cost 16 . The prices per ticket for the remaining days are [8, 6] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the third day with cost 16 . The price per ticket for the remaining day is [8] . 
  * Buy 2 tickets on the fourth day with cost 16 .

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the length of `b`, `n` is the last `n` read from the input, `m` is the last `m` read from the input, `k` is the last `k` read from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in the list `b` if `k % m != 0` or `None` if `k % m == 0`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b` if `k % m != 0` or `-1` if `k % m == 0`, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a` if `k % m == 0`, otherwise `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the first `n` elements of `a` if `k % m != 0`, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b` during the loop execution if `k % m == 0`, otherwise `leng` is the number of elements added to `b` during the loop execution if `k % m != 0`, `b` is a list containing the elements from `a` that meet the condition `a[i] in s` and `leng < k // m` if `k % m == 0`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the elements from the first `n` elements of `a` that satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` if `k % m != 0`, `res` is the sum of `((b[j] + j * m) * m)` for `j` ranging from `0` to `len(b) - 1` if `k % m == 0` or the final value after the loop if `k % m != 0`, and the print statement outputs `min(a) * k` if `k <= m` or the value of `res` if `k > m`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, each defined by integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\) along with a list \(a\) of \(n\) integers. It calculates and prints the result based on the following rules:
1. If \(k \leq m\), it prints the minimum element of the list \(a\) multiplied by \(k\).
2. Otherwise, it creates a subset of the smallest unique elements from the first \(n\) elements of \(a\) based on the value of \(k\) modulo \(m\):
   - If \(k \% m == 0\), it selects the smallest \(k // m\) unique elements.
   - If \(k \% m != 0\), it selects the smallest \(k // m + 1\) unique elements.
3. It then constructs a new list \(b\) from the original list \(a\) using the selected elements, ensuring no duplicates.
4. For each element in \(b\), it calculates a weighted sum based on its position in the list, either \( (b[j] + j \times m) \times m \) if \(k \% m == 0\) or the final value after the loop if \(k \% m != 0\).
5. Finally, it prints the computed weighted sum.
Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The function assumes that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which means it can handle up to 10,000 test cases. However, it does not handle the case where the number of test cases exceeds this limit.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where \(k\) is exactly equal to \(m\), although it should be covered under the condition \(k \leq m\).
- The function does not include any error handling for invalid input, such as non-integer values or out-of-range values for \(n\), \(m\), or \(k\).
