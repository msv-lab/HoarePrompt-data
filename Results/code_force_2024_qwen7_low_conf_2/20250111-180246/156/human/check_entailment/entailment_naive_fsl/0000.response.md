Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the case where the number of tickets to be purchased exceeds the product of the number of days and the maximum tickets that can be purchased per day (`m`). Specifically, the logic for calculating the minimum cost is flawed. Here's an example to illustrate the issue:

Consider the input:
```
4 3 10
1 2 3 4
```
According to the problem description, the maximum number of tickets that can be purchased in total is `m * n = 3 * 4 = 12`. In this case, we need to purchase 10 tickets. The optimal strategy would be to buy 3 tickets on the first day (costing 3), 3 tickets on the second day (costing 6), 3 tickets on the third day (costing 9), and 1 ticket on the fourth day (costing 4). This results in a total cost of `3 + 6 + 9 + 4 = 22`.

However, the program attempts to distribute the 10 tickets across the 4 days in a manner that doesn't account for the sequential price increase correctly. For instance, it might incorrectly calculate the cost distribution, leading to a higher total cost.

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the problem with the provided solution:
- The code does not properly handle the sequential price increases after purchasing tickets on a given day.
- It uses sets and sorting to select the cheapest tickets but does not correctly account for the cumulative effect of purchasing tickets and the resulting price increases.
- The logic for distributing tickets across days and calculating the total cost is overly complex and does not accurately reflect the described behavior of the price increase mechanism.

Therefore, the program fails to correctly compute the minimum cost for purchasing the required number of tickets in certain scenarios, making it incorrect.
