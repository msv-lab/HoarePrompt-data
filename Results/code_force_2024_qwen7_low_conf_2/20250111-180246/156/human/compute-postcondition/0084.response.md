The code snippet reads three integers (`n`, `m`, `k`) from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This operation does not directly assign these values to any pre-existing variables but rather assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. The other variables (`t`, `i`, `a`, `c`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the length of `b` (since \(k > m\)), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in the list `b`, and `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
