The value of `c` is incremented by `m`. No other variables are affected by this operation. The conditions and values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is updated to `res + (b[i_prev + 1] + c) * m`, `n` is greater than 0, `b` contains at least one element, `leng` is at least 1, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` will remain the same unless the current value of `b[i_prev + 1]` changes the maximum value or its index, `s` and `c` will remain the same unless modified within the loop, `c` is incremented by `m`, and `i` starts from `i_prev + 1`.**
