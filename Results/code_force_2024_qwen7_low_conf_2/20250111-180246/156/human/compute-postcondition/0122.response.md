`b.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` from the set `s` to the list `b`. The value of `n` and `leng` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a[i]` is in set `s`; `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`; `b` contains the element `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a[i]` is in set `s`; `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`; `b` contains the element `a[i]`**
