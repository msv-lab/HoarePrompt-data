The code `c += k % m` updates the value of `c` by adding `k % m` to its current value. No other variables are affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is increased by 1, `c` is increased by `k % m`, `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`, `res` is updated by adding `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` to its current value.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `c` is increased by `k % m`, `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`, `res` is updated by adding `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` to its current value.**
