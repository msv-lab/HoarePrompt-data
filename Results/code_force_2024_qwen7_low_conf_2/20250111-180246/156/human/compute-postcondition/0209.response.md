The code snippet `b.append(a[i])` implies that the value of `a[i]` is appended to the list `b`. However, there are no pre-defined values for `a` or `i` in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `a[i]` is appended to `b`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is less than `n`, `b` is a list with `a[i]` appended to it.**
