`b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. The value of `i` is 2, but the exact value of `a[2]` is not specified. However, the initial state includes the following conditions:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is 2
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop
- `mx` is `None`
- `mx_ind_lt` is `-1`
- `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a`
- `leng` remains the same as its initial value (either 1 or 0)
- `b` is a list with the value `a[i]` appended to it if `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m`. Otherwise, `b` does not change.

Since the code only affects `b` by appending `a[i]` (which is `a[2]`) to it, the updated state for `b` will be `b = [a[2]]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is `None`, `mx_ind_lt` is `-1`, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, `leng` remains the same as its initial value (either 1 or 0), `b` is `[a[2]]`.**
