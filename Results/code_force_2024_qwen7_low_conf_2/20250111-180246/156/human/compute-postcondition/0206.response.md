`leng` is incremented by 1, which means the length of a list or similar structure is increased by 1. The value of `n` and the expression `i + 1` are not directly affected by this line of code. The value of `b` is updated by appending an element from `a` at index `i`, but this does not directly relate to `leng`. The initial conditions of `n` being greater than 0 and `i` being `i + 1` remain valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is `i + 1`, `b` is updated by appending the element at index `i` of `a`, `leng` is incremented by 1.**
