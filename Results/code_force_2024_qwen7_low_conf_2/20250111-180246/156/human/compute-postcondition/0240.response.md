Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the length of `b` + 1, `n` is the integer read from the input, `m` is the integer read from the input, `k` is the integer read from the input, `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is either the final value after the loop if `k % m == 0` or `c + len(b) * m` if `k % m != 0`, `mx` is either the maximum value in `b` if `k % m != 0` or `None` if `k % m == 0`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b` if `k % m != 0` or `-1` if `k % m == 0`, `s` is either the set of the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the first `n` elements of `a` if those elements satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` and `leng < k // m + 1` if `k % m != 0`, otherwise `s` remains unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements appended to `b` if the condition is satisfied, otherwise `leng` remains unchanged, `b` is a list containing the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the first `n` elements of `a` if those elements satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` and `leng < k // m + 1` if `k % m != 0`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, `res` is the sum of `((b[j] + j * m) * m)` for `j` ranging from `0` to `len(b) - 1` if `k % m == 0` or the final value after the loop if `k % m != 0`, and the print statement outputs `min(a) * k` if `k <= m`.**
