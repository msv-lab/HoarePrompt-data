Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `b` contains at least one element, `leng` is at least 1, `res` is 0, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, `s` is the set of the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, and `c` is 0, and either `b[i] != mx` or `i != mx_ind_lt`**
