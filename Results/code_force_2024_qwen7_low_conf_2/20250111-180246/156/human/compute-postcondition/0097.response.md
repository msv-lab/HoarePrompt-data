`leng` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `leng` is either 1 or 0 based on the initial state. Since `leng` was already 1, incrementing it by 1 makes `leng` equal to 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is `None`, `mx_ind_lt` is `-1`, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, `leng` is 2, `b` is a list with the value `a[i]` appended to it.**
