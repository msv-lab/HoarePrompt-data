Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`; `b` is a list with either two or three elements depending on whether `a[1]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m + 1`; `leng` is 2 if `a[1]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m + 1`, otherwise `leng` is 0.***
