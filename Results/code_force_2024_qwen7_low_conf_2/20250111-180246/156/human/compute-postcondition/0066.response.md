Postcondition: ***`total` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and not divisible by `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list containing at most \((k // m) + 1\) elements, each element being an integer from `a` that is also in `s` and satisfying the condition `leng < k // m + 1`, `leng` must be greater than 0, `c` is either `k % m` or `m` depending on whether `n` is less than or equal to \((k // m) + 1\) or not, `res` is updated by adding `b[i] * c` to its current value, `mx` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, and `n` satisfies the condition `n <= (k // m) + 1` if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` or `n >= (k // m) + 1` otherwise.***
