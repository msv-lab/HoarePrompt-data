`leng` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n`, and `b` is a list with `a[i]` appended to it. The length of `b` was previously `i+1`, so now it is `i+2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n`, `b` is a list with `a[i]` in it, and `leng` is `i+1` + 1, which simplifies to `leng` is `i+2`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is less than `n`, `b` is a list with `a[i]` in it, `leng` is `i+2`**
