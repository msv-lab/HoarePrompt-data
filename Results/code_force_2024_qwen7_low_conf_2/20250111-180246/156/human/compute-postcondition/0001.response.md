State before the loop starts: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an input integer.

To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's think through the requirements for the `for` loop:

1. **Variable `i`:** The loop variable `i` starts from 0 (default behavior) and increments by 1 with each iteration. For the loop to execute at least once, `i` should be within the range defined by `range(n)`, which means `i` must be less than `n`.

2. **Variable `n`:** The `range(n)` function generates numbers starting from 0 up to, but not including, `n`. Therefore, `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Since `i` starts from 0, if `n` is 1, the loop will still execute once.

Given the above considerations, we need to ensure that the loop condition `0 <= i < n` holds true for at least one value of `i`. This requires `n` to be greater than or equal to 1.

The initial state of `t` (which ranges from 1 to \(10^4\)) does not affect the loop execution directly. However, since we are asked to adjust the state for the loop to execute, we will focus on the necessary adjustments related to `i` and `n`.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `i` starts at 0, so we need to ensure that the loop can execute at least once, meaning `n` should be at least 1.
