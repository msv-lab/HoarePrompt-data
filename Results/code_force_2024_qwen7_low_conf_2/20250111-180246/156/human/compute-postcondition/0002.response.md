The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`. This means that the values of `t` and `i` remain unchanged, while `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new values. Since the exact values of the input are not specified, we cannot provide specific values for `n`, `m`, and `k`, but we know they are integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
