`res` is incremented by the value of `(b[i] + c) * m`. The value of `b[i]` is taken from the list `b` at index `i`, and `c` and `m` are added together, then multiplied by `b[i]`. The exact value of `res` depends on the specific values of `b[i]`, `c`, and `m`, but it is updated accordingly. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`b` must have at least one element; `res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * m`**
