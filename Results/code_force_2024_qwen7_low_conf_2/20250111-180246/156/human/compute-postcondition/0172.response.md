`leng` is incremented by 1, changing its value from less than `k` divided by `m` to `leng + 1`. The other variables (`n`, `a[i]`, `s`, `k`, `m`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `a[i]` is an element in set `s`, `leng` is equal to `leng + 1`, `k` divided by `m`, `b` is a list including `a[i]`**
