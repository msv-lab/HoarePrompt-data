The code `c += k % m` increments the value of `c` by the value of `k % m`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

- The initial state includes: `b` contains at least one element, the maximum element `mx` in `b` is equal to `b[i]` where `i` is the index of the maximum element in `b` that is less than or equal to `mx_ind_lt`, and `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)`.
- After executing the code, the value of `c` changes to `c + (k % m)`.

Output State: **`b` contains at least one element, the maximum element `mx` in `b` is equal to `b[i]` where `i` is the index of the maximum element in `b` that is less than or equal to `mx_ind_lt`, `c` is `c + (k % m)`, and `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)`**.
