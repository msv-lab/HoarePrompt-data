Let's break down the problem step by step to understand how the states should be modified at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `total` is 0
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is equal to `n`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer and not divisible by `m`
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`
- `b` is a list containing at most \((k // m) + 1\) elements, each element being an integer from `a` that is also in `s` and satisfying the condition `leng < k // m + 1`
- `leng` must be greater than 0
- `c` is either `k % m` or `m` depending on whether `n` is less than or equal to \((k // m) + 1\) or not
- `res` is updated by adding `b[i] * c` to its current value
- `mx` is the maximum value in the list `b`
- `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`
- `n` satisfies the condition `n <= (k // m) + 1` if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` or `n >= (k // m) + 1` otherwise

### Loop Analysis
The loop is defined as:
```python
for i in range(len(b)):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Key Points to Consider
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop will iterate over all indices in the list `b`.
2. **Loop Body**: The loop body is omitted, but it updates the state based on certain conditions involving `b`, `i`, and other variables.

### Adjusting the States
At the start of the next iteration, the following changes need to be made:

1. **Increment `i`**: Since the loop is iterating over the list `b`, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. **Check Loop Condition**: Ensure that the loop can continue. This means checking that `i` is still within the bounds of `len(b)`.

### Updated States
Given that `i` is currently equal to `n` and the loop condition requires `i` to be within the bounds of `b`, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented appropriately for the next iteration. 

Since `i` is initially set to `n` and the loop iterates over the entire list `b`, `i` will increment to the next index after the current one. Therefore, `i` will become `i + 1`.

### Final Answer
