The code snippet updates the value of `res` based on the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt`. If this condition is true, `res` is updated by adding the value of `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` to its current value.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `c` is increased by either `(k % m)` or `2m` based on the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt`
- `res` is increased by either `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` or `(b[i] + c) * m` based on the same condition

The code snippet only affects `res` by adding `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` to its current value, regardless of the initial conditions for `c`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `c` is increased by either `(k % m)` or `2m` based on the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt`, `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)`**
