The value of `leng` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `leng` is 1, so after executing `leng += 1`, the new value of `leng` is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `k` is greater than `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list with one additional element `a[i]`, `leng` is 2, and `a[i]` is in `s`.**
