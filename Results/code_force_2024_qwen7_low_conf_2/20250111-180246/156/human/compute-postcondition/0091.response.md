Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is None, `mx_ind_lt` is -1, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, `leng` is 0, and the current value of `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m`.***
