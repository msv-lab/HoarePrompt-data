`b.append(a[i])` appends the element `a[i]` from set `s` to list `b`. The values of `n`, `leng`, `k`, `m`, and `a[i]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` must be at least 1, `a[i]` is an element in set `s`, `leng` is less than `k` divided by `m`, and `b` is a list that now includes the element `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `a[i]` is an element in set `s`, `leng` is less than `k` divided by `m`, `b` is a list including `a[i]`**
