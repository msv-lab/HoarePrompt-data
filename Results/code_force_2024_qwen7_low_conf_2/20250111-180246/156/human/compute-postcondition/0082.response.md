Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is either the length of `b` (if the condition `k > m` is true) or 0 (if the condition `k <= m` is true), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and the output is either `min(a) * k` (if `k <= m`) or `res` which is the accumulated result based on the conditions inside the loop (if `k > m`). Additionally, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in the list `b`, and `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`.***
