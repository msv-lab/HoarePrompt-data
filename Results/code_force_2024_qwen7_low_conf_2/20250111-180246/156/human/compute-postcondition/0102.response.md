Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is `None`, `mx_ind_lt` is `-1`, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, `leng` remains the same as its initial value (either 1 or 0), `b` is `[a[2]]` if `a[2]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m`. Otherwise, `b` does not change.***
