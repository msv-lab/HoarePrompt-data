The code snippet appends `a[i]` to the list `b`. The values of `i`, `a`, `m`, `k`, `s`, `leng`, and `t` remain unchanged. The value of `b` changes by adding `a[i]` to it.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and `k` is greater than `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list with either no additional elements or one additional element `a[i]` appended, and `leng` is either 0 or 2.**
