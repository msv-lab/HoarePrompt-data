Postcondition: ***`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 more than it was in the previous iteration and less than `n`, `b` includes all its previous elements plus `a[i]`, `leng` is incremented by 1. If `a[i]` is not in `s` or `leng` is not less than `k // m`, the postcondition remains as `n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1 more than it was in the previous iteration and less than `n`, and the state of `b` and `leng` does not change.***
