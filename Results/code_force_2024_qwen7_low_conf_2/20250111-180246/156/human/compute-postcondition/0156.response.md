The code `c += m` increases the value of `c` by `m`. The initial state is that `c` is increased by either `(k % m)` or `2m` based on the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt`, and `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`.

After executing `c += m`, the value of `c` will be updated to its original value plus `m`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `c` is increased by `(k % m)` or `2m` plus `m` based on the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt`, `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`, and `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` condition is no longer checked.**
