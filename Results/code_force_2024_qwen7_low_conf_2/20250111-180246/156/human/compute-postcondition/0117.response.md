`s` is assigned the value of a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`. The value of `k // m + 1` is calculated using the integer division of `k` by `m` and adding 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the length of `b` (since \(k > m\)), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in the list `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, `k` is an input integer, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m + 1` elements of the sorted list `a`**.
