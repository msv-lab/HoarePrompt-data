The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial state, let's break down the impact:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`.
- `b` is a list with two elements `[a[0], a[1]]`.
- `leng` is 1.
- `a[1]` is in `s` if the condition `a[1] in s and leng < k // m + 1` is true. Otherwise, `b` remains a list with one element, `leng` remains 0, and `a[1] is in `s`.

The relevant part here is the line `b.append(a[i])`. Since `i` is 2, this means `b` will now contain three elements: `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables after executing the code is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `i` is 2.
- `n` must be greater than 0.
- `m` is an input integer.
- `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
- `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`.
- `b` is now a list with three elements `[a[0], a[1], a[2]]`.
- `leng` is 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`; `b` is a list with three elements `[a[0], a[1], a[2]]; `leng` is 1.**
