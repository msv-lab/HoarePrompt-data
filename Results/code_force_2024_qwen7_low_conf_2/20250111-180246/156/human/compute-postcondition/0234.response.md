`res` is incremented by the value `(b[i] + c) * m`. The previous value of `i` is `i_prev + 1`, so the new value of `i` is `i_prev + 2`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `b` contains at least one element, `leng` is at least 1, `res` is updated to its previous value plus `(b[i_prev + 2] + c) * m`, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain the same, `s` and `c` remain the same, `i` is `i_prev + 2`, and `c` remains unchanged.**
