The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input, converts each string in the input to an integer, and stores these integers in the list `a`. The previous values of `i`, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. Since the input is not specified, we cannot determine the exact values in the list `a`, but we know that it is a list of integers.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
