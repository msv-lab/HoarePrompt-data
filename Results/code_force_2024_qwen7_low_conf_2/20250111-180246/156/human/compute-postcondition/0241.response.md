Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the length of `b`, `n` is the last `n` read from the input, `m` is the last `m` read from the input, `k` is the last `k` read from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in the list `b` if `k % m != 0` or `None` if `k % m == 0`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b` if `k % m != 0` or `-1` if `k % m == 0`, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a` if `k % m == 0`, otherwise `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the first `n` elements of `a` if `k % m != 0`, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b` during the loop execution if `k % m == 0`, otherwise `leng` is the number of elements added to `b` during the loop execution if `k % m != 0`, `b` is a list containing the elements from `a` that meet the condition `a[i] in s` and `leng < k // m` if `k % m == 0`, otherwise `b` is a list containing the elements from the first `n` elements of `a` that satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` if `k % m != 0`, `res` is the sum of `((b[j] + j * m) * m)` for `j` ranging from `0` to `len(b) - 1` if `k % m == 0` or the final value after the loop if `k % m != 0`, and the print statement outputs `min(a) * k` if `k <= m` or the value of `res` if `k > m`.**
