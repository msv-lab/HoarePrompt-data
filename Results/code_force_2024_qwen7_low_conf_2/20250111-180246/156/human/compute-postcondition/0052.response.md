The value of `leng` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `leng` was 1, so now `leng` is 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 2; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`; `b` is a list with three elements `[a[0], a[1], a[2]]; `leng` is 2.**
