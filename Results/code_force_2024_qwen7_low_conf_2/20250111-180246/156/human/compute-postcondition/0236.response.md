Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `b` contains at least one element, `leng` is at least 1, `res` is updated as follows: if `b[i] == mx` and `i == mx_ind_lt`, then `res` is updated as `res += (b[i_prev + 1] + c) * (k % m)`, otherwise `res` is updated to its previous value plus `(b[i_prev + 2] + c) * m`, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain the same, `s` and `c` remain the same, `i` is either `i_prev + 1` or `i_prev + 2`, and `c` is incremented accordingly by either `k % m` or `m`.**
