The value of `c` is incremented by `k % m`. The other variables remain unchanged based on their previous states. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0; `b` contains at least one element; `leng` is at least 1; `res` is updated as `res += (b[i_prev + 1] + c) * (k % m)`, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain the same, `s` and `c` remain the same, `i` is `i_prev + 1`; `c` is incremented by `k % m`.
