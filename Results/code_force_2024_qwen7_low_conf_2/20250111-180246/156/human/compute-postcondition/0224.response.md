Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 0, `b` contains at least one element, `leng` is at least 1, `res` is updated as follows: if `b[i] == mx` and `i == mx_ind_lt`, then `res` is increased by `mx * (k % m)`. Otherwise, `res` is increased by `b[i] * m`, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, `s` is the set of the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, and `c` is increased by either `k % m` or `m`.**
