`c` is incremented by `k % m`. The value of `c` was initially 0, so now `c` is `k % m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`res` is increased by `mx * (k % m)`, `b[i]` is `mx`, `i` is `mx_ind_lt`, `leng` is at least 1, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, `s` is the set of the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, and `c` is `k % m`.**
