The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and assigns the resulting list to the variable `a`. This means that the initial values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `c`, `mx`, and `mx_ind_lt` remain unchanged, but `a` now contains a list of integers based on the user's input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the length of `b` (since \(k > m\)), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in the list `b`, and `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer.**
