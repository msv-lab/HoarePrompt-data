`res` is incremented by the value of `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)`. Here, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, so the new value of `i` is `i_prev + 1`. The other variables `b`, `leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `s`, and `c` remain unchanged. The precondition that `n` is greater than 0 and `b` contains at least one element is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `b` contains at least one element, `leng` is at least 1, `res` is updated as res += (b[i_prev + 1] + c) * (k % m), `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain the same, `s` and `c` remain the same, `i` is `i_prev + 1`.**
