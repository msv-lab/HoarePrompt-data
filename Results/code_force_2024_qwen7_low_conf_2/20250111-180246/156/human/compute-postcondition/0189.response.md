The code updates the variable `res` by adding the product of `(b[i] + c)` and `m`. The value of `b[i]` is taken from the list `b` at index `i`, `c` is incremented by `m`, and `res` is updated accordingly.

Given the initial state:
- `b` must have at least one element.
- `res` is updated to `res + (b[i_current + 1] + c) * m`.
- `c` is incremented by `m`.

Let's denote the updated index as `i = i_current + 1` since the code uses `b[i]` and the previous state refers to `b[i_current + 1]`.

So, the updated `res` will be `res + (b[i] + c) * m`, and `c` will be `c + m`.

Output State: **`b` must have at least one element, `res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * m`, `c` is incremented by `m + m`.**
