The code snippet `print(min(a) * k)` prints the minimum value of the list `a` multiplied by `k`. However, this operation does not affect any of the variables except for potentially printing their values. The values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `c`, `mx`, and `mx_ind_lt` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the length of `b` (since \(k > m\)), `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in the list `b`, and `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, the minimum value of `a` is printed multiplied by `k`.**
