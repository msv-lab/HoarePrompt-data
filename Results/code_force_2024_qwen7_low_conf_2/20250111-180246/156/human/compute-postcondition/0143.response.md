`res` is incremented by the value of `(b[i] + c) * m`, where `b[i]` is an element in the list `b` at index `i`, `c` is another variable, and `m` is yet another variable. The values of `b`, `c`, and `m` remain unchanged, and the condition that `b` contains at least one element and `i` is not equal to `mx` or `i` is not equal to `mx_ind_lt` is still valid.

Output State: **`res` is increased by (b[i] + c) * m, b contains at least one element, i is not equal to mx or i is not equal to mx_ind_lt**
