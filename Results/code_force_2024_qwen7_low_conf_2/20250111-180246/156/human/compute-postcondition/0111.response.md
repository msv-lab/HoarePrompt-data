`c` is incremented by `m`. The value of `m` is an input integer, so `c` becomes `c + m`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a non-negative integer less than `len(b)`, `len(b)` must be at least 1, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is `c + m`, `mx` is `None`, `mx_ind_lt` is `-1`, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b` during the loop execution, `b` is a list containing the elements from `a` that meet the condition `a[i] in s` and `leng < k // m`, `res` is `res + (b[i] + m) * m`**
