`res` is incremented by the value `(b[i] + c) * m`. The exact value of `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and since the values of `b`, `c`, and `m` are not specified, they remain as they were. The conditions on `n`, `b`, `leng`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `s`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `res` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`res` is updated to `res + (b[i_prev + 1] + c) * m`, `n` is greater than 0, `b` contains at least one element, `leng` is at least 1, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` will remain the same unless the current value of `b[i_prev + 1]` changes the maximum value or its index, `s` and `c` will remain the same unless modified within the loop, and `i` starts from `i_prev + 1`.**
