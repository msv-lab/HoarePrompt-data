The code snippet `res += (b[i] + c) * (k % m)` impacts the variable `res` by adding `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` to its current value. The other variables (`i`, `c`, and `b[i]`) might have been affected in previous steps, but their values remain unchanged from the precondition unless specified otherwise.

Since the exact values of `b[i]`, `c`, `k`, `m`, `mx`, and `mx_ind_lt` are not provided, we will use the general conditions given in the initial state:

- `c` is increased by `(k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `m`.
- `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`.

Given the condition in the code snippet, the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` does not need to be explicitly checked again since it already determines the behavior of `c` and `res`. Thus, the code snippet updates `res` according to the specified condition.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `c` is increased by `(k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `m`, `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`, `res` is updated by adding `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` to its current value.**
