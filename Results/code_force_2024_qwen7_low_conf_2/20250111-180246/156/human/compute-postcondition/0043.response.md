The code `b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the conditions:

- `a[i]` is in `s`
- `leng` is less than \((k // m) + 1\)

Since `a[i]` is already in `s` and appending it to `b` does not affect the condition that `leng` must be less than \((k // m) + 1\), the only change is the addition of `a[i]` to `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list with one more element (the value of `a[i]`), `leng` is 0, `a[i]` is in `s`**
