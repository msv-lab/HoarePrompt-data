According to the given code, the loop iterates over the list `b` using the variable `i`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is within the bounds of the list `b`.

Let's break down the information and determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `b` contains at least one element.
   - `leng` is at least 1.
   - `res` is updated based on specific conditions involving `b[i]`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `i_prev + 1`, `c`, and `k % m`.
   - `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain unchanged unless the current value of `b[i_prev + 1]` changes the maximum value or its index.
   - `s` and `c` remain the same unless modified within the loop.
   - `i` starts from `i_prev + 1`.
   - `c` is either updated to `c + (k % m)` or incremented by `m` depending on the if condition.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for each index `i` in the range of `len(b)`.
   - At the end of the last iteration, `i` starts from `i_prev + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - Therefore, `i_prev + 1` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - Since `i` starts from `i_prev + 1`, the new value of `i` will be `i_prev + 2`.

Given this analysis, let's update the states accordingly:

- `i` will be `i_prev + 1` at the start of the next iteration, and it will become `i_prev + 2` after incrementing.
- `b` remains the same unless modified within the loop.
- `leng` remains the same unless the length of `b` changes.
- `res`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `s`, and `c` remain the same unless modified within the loop.
- `i` starts from `i_prev + 1` and increments by 1.

So, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `b` contains at least one element, `leng` is at least 1, `res` is updated as specified, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain the same, `s` and `c` remain the same, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `c` remains unchanged.** 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the bounds of `b`. Thus, the state should reflect that `i` is set to `i_prev + 1` and the loop will proceed to `i_prev + 2`:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `b` contains at least one element, `leng` is at least 1, `res` is updated as specified, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain the same, `s` and `c` remain the same, `i` is `i_prev + 1`, and `c` remains unchanged.**
