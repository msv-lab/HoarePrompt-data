Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `total` is 0
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `i` is equal to `n + 1`
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer and not divisible by `m`
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
   - `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`
   - `b` is a list containing at most \((k // m) + 1\) elements, each element being an integer from `a` that is also in `s` and satisfying the condition `leng < k // m + 1`
   - `leng` must be greater than 0
   - `c` is updated based on the if condition: \(2 \cdot (k \% m)\) if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` and \(c + m\) otherwise
   - `mx` is the maximum value in the list `b`
   - `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`
   - `n` satisfies the condition `n <= (k // m) + 1` if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` or `n >= (k // m) + 1` otherwise

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs over the range of `len(b)`.
   - For the loop to execute, `i` must be within the range of `len(b)`.

3. **State After the Previous Iteration**:
   - `i` is equal to `n + 1`
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.

4. **Adjusting the States**:
   - Since `i` is currently `n + 1`, for the loop to continue, `n + 1` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - Therefore, we need to update `i` to `i + 1` and check if this new value of `i` is still within the bounds of `len(b)`.

Given these points, let's update the states:

- `i` must now be `i + 1`, which means it becomes `(n + 1) + 1 = n + 2`.
- Since `n` must satisfy the original condition (`n <= (k // m) + 1` if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` or `n >= (k // m) + 1` otherwise), this condition remains unchanged for the next iteration.
- All other states remain the same.

Therefore, the new state is:

State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `n + 2`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and not divisible by `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list containing at most \((k // m) + 1\) elements, each element being an integer from `a` that is also in `s` and satisfying the condition `leng < k // m + 1`, `leng` must be greater than 0, `c` is updated based on the if condition: \(2 \cdot (k \% m)\) if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` and \(c + m\) otherwise, `mx` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, and `n` satisfies the condition `n <= (k // m) + 1` if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` or `n >= (k // m) + 1` otherwise.**
