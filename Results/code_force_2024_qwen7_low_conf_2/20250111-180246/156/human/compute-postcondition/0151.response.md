Postcondition: **`i` is increased by 1, `c` is increased by either `(k % m)` or `2m`, and `res` is increased by either `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` or `(b[i] + c) * m`. Specifically, if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, then `c` is increased by `(k % m)`, `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)`, and `res` is updated by adding `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` to its current value. Otherwise, `c` is increased by `2m`, `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`, and `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is false.**
