Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list with one more element (the value of `a[i]`), `leng` is 1, and `a[i]` is in `s` if the condition `a[i] in s and leng < k // m + 1` is true. Otherwise, `b` remains an empty list, `leng` remains 0, and `a[i]` is in `s`.***
