To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given States at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `b` contains at least one element.
- `c` is increased by `(k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `m`.
- `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over the range of `len(b)`. This means the loop will continue as long as `i < len(b)`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Iteration**: The loop variable `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1 in each iteration until `i` reaches `len(b) - 1`.
2. **Condition Check**: In each iteration, the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, then:
     - `c` is updated to `c + (k % m)`.
     - `res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * (k % m)`.
   - If the condition is false, then:
     - `c` is updated to `c + m`.
     - `res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * m`.

### State Adjustments for the Next Iteration:
- **`b`**: Since the loop will check the next element in `b`, `b` remains the same.
- **`i`**: After the previous iteration, `i` was incremented by 1, so now `i` is `i + 1`.
- **`c`**: The value of `c` will depend on whether the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` was true or false in the current iteration.
- **`res`**: Similarly, the value of `res` will depend on whether the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` was true or false in the current iteration.

### Final Answer:
At the end of the previous iteration, the state needs to be adjusted for the next iteration as follows:

- `i` is incremented by 1.
- `c` is updated based on the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt`.
- `res` is updated based on the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt`.

Since the exact values of `c` and `res` depend on the condition in the current iteration, we cannot provide specific numerical values for them without knowing the exact conditions met. However, we can state the general adjustment required.

**State:**
- **`i` is increased by 1**.
- **`c` is increased by `(k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `m`**.
- **`res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`**.

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`i` is increased by 1, `c` is increased by `(k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `m`, `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`**.
