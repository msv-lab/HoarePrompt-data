The value of `c` is increased by `m`. The previous state of `c` was already increased by `m`, so this operation increments it further by `m`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is increased by 1, `c` is increased by 2m, `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`, `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is false**
