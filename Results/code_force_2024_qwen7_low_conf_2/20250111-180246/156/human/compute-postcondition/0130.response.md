The code snippet `b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. However, the initial values of `a` and `i` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value that was appended to `b`. We only know that `b` now contains whatever was previously in `b` plus the value of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`b` contains its previous elements plus `a[i]`, `i` remains unchanged**
