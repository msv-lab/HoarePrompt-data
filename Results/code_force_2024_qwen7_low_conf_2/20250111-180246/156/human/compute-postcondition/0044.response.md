The value of `leng` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `leng` was 0, so now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state. 

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list with one more element (the value of `a[i]`), `leng` is 1, `a[i]` is in `s`.**
