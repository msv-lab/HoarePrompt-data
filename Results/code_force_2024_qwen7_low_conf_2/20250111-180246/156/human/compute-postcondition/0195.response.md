Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the length of `b` + 1, `n` is the integer read from the input, `m` is the integer read from the input, `k` is the integer read from the input, `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value after the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in the list `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b` during the loop execution, `b` is a list containing the elements from the list `a` that satisfy the condition `a[i] in s`, `res` is the final value after the loop.**
