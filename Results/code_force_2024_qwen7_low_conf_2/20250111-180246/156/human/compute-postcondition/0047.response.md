Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is defined as follows:
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `m` is an input integer
   - `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`
   - `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
   - `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`
   - `b` is a list with two elements (the value of `a[0]` and `a[1]`)
   - `leng` is 1
   - `a[1]` is in `s` if the condition `a[1] in s and leng < k // m + 1` is true. Otherwise, `b` remains a list with one element, `leng` remains 0, and `a[1]` is in `s`.

2. The code snippet to be executed is:
   ```python
   b.append(a[i])
   ```

3. Since `i` is initially 1, `b.append(a[1])` appends the value of `a[1]` to the list `b`.

4. The list `b` originally had two elements, `[a[0], a[1]]`. After appending `a[1]`, the list `b` now has three elements: `[a[0], a[1], a[1]]`.

5. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated state of the program is:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is 1
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`
- `b` is a list with three elements: `[a[0], a[1], a[1]]`
- `leng` is 1
- `a[1]` is in `s` if the condition `a[1] in s and leng < k // m + 1` is true. Otherwise, `b` remains a list with one element, `leng` remains 0, and `a[1]` is in `s`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`; `b` is a list with three elements: `[a[0], a[1], a[1]]`; `leng` is 1; `a[1]` is in `s` if the condition `a[1] in s and leng < k // m + 1` is true. Otherwise, `b` remains a list with one element, `leng` remains 0, and `a[1]` is in `s`.**
