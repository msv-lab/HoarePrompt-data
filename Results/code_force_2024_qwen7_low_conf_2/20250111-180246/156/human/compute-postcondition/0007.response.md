Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, and `k` is greater than `m`. The current value of `k` satisfies the condition \(k \% m == 0\).***
