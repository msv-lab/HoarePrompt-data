`b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. The variable `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the list `b` gains a new element, which is `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` must be less than `n`; `b` contains the element `a[i]` appended to it**
