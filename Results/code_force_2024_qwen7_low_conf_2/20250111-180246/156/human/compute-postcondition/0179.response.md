`b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 from its previous value (since `i` is 1 more than it was in the previous iteration) and is still less than `n`. The value of `n` and the value of `i` before this line of code being executed are not affected.

Therefore, the updated state after executing this line of code is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 more than it was in the previous iteration, and `i` must be less than `n`; `b` includes all its previous elements plus `a[i]`.**
