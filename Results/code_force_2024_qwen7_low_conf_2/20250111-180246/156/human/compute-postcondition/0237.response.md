Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `b` is a list containing the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the first `n` elements of `a` if those elements satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` and `leng < k // m + 1`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged, `leng` is the number of elements appended to `b` if the condition is satisfied, otherwise `leng` remains unchanged, `res` is the accumulated result after all iterations of the loop, `mx` is the maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, `s` is the set of the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, and `c` is the cumulative increment value after all iterations.**
