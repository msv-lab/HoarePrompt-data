According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the condition `n >= 1` must hold true for the loop to continue. The loop iterates over the range from `0` to `n-1`, so `i` is incremented by 1 at each iteration.

Given that `i` was used in the loop and incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, `i` is now `i + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`.

The initial condition is `n >= 1`, and since we are starting a new iteration, `n` remains unchanged unless otherwise specified. Therefore, `n` must still satisfy the condition `n >= 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` must be less than `n`**.
