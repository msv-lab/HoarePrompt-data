Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`; `b` is a list with two elements `[a[0], a[1]]`; `leng` is 1; `a[1]` is in `s` if the condition `a[1] in s and leng < k // m + 1` is true. Otherwise, `b` remains a list with one element, `leng` remains 0, and `a[1]` is in `s`.***
