The line of code `leng = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `leng`. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `leng` and maintains the values of the other variables as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is an empty list, `leng` is 0**
