The code reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` using `input().split()`, and converts them to integers using `map(int, ...)`. This operation does not modify the existing variables but assigns new values to `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, the values of `t`, `i`, `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `c`, `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `s`, `leng`, `b`, and `res` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the length of `b` + 1, `n` is the integer read from the input, `m` is the integer read from the input, `k` is the integer read from the input, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is either `len(b) * m` if `k % m == 0` or the final value after the loop if `k % m != 0`, `mx` is either `None` if `k % m == 0` or the last maximum value in the list `b` if `k % m != 0`, `mx_ind_lt` is either `-1` if `k % m == 0` or the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b` if `k % m != 0`, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a` if `k % m == 0`, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b` during the loop execution if `k % m == 0`, `b` is a list containing the elements from `a` that meet the condition `a[i] in s` and `leng < k // m` if `k % m == 0` or contains the elements from the list `a` that satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` if `k % m != 0`, `res` is the sum of `((b[j] + j*m) * m)` for `j` ranging from `0` to `len(b) - 1` if `k % m == 0` or the final value after the loop if `k % m != 0`.**
