`c` is increased by `k % m`. The initial state indicates that `c` is increased by either `(k % m)` or `2m` based on a specific condition, but this condition is not relevant to the current line of code since it only increments `c` by `k % m`. Therefore, the updated value of `c` is the original value of `c` plus `k % m`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `c` is increased by `k % m`, `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)`**
