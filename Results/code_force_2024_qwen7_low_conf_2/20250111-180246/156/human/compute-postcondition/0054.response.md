Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is equal to `n`; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`; `b` is a list containing at most \((k // m) + 1\) elements, each element being an integer from `a` that is also in `s` and satisfying the condition `leng < k // m + 1`; `leng` is equal to the number of elements added to `b` and is at most \((k // m) + 1\).**
