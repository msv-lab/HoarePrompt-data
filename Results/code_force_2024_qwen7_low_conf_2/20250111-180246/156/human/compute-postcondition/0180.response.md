`leng` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is updated to be 2 more than its previous value, and it must still be less than `n`. The list `b` remains unchanged, including all its previous elements plus `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 2 more than it was in the previous iteration and less than `n`, `b` includes all its previous elements plus `a[i]`, `leng` is incremented by 1.**
