Let's break down the given Python code and see how it impacts the variables:

Initial State:
- `total` is 0
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)
- `i` is equal to `n + 1`
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `m` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer and not divisible by `m`
- `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input
- `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`
- `b` is a list containing at most \((k // m) + 1\) elements, each element being an integer from `a` that is also in `s` and satisfying the condition `leng < k // m + 1`
- `leng` must be greater than 0
- `c` is either `k % m` or `m` depending on whether `n` is less than or equal to \((k // m) + 1\) or not
- `res` is updated by adding `b[i] * c` to its current value
- `mx` is the maximum value in the list `b`
- `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`
- `n` satisfies the condition `n <= (k // m) + 1` if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` or `n >= (k // m) + 1` otherwise

Code:
```python
res += (b[i] + c) * m
```

Impact on the program:
- The value of `res` is updated by adding `(b[i] + c) * m` to its current value.

Since the exact values of `b[i]`, `c`, and `m` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `res`. However, we know that `res` will be increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and not divisible by `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list containing at most \((k // m) + 1\) elements, each element being an integer from `a` that is also in `s` and satisfying the condition `leng < k // m + 1`, `leng` must be greater than 0, `c` is either `k % m` or `m` depending on whether `n` is less than or equal to \((k // m) + 1\) or not, `res` is updated by adding `(b[i] + c) * m` to its current value, `mx` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, and `n` satisfies the condition `n <= (k // m) + 1` if `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` or `n >= (k // m) + 1` otherwise.**
