Postcondition: ***`i` is incremented by 1. `c` is increased by either `(k % m)` or `2m + m` based on the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt`. `res` is increased by either `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` or `(b[i] + c) * m` based on the same condition. The condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is no longer checked after the if-else block executes.***
