The code `c += m` increments the value of `c` by `m`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `b` contains at least one element, `leng` is at least 1, `res` is updated to its previous value plus `(b[i_prev + 2] + c) * m`, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain the same, `s` remains the same, `c` is incremented by `m`, and `i` is `i_prev + 2`.**
