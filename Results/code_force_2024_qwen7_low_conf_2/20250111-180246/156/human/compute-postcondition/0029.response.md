`c` is incremented by `m`. The value of `res` remains unchanged as it was defined before `c` was updated. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is `res_initial + (b_i + c_val) * m_val`, `b[i]` is `b_i`, `c` is `c_val + m_val`, `m` is `m_val`.

Output State: **`res` is `res_initial + (b_i + c_val) * m_val`, `b[i]` is `b_i`, `c` is `c_val + m_val`, `m` is `m_val`.**
