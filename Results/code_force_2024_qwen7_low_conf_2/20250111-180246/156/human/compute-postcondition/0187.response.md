The code `c += m` increments the value of `c` by `m`. The other variables `b`, `res`, and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `c`.

Output State: **`b` must have at least one element; `res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * m`; `c` is incremented by `m`.**
