The code snippet updates the variable `c` by adding the value of `m` to it. The original value of `c` is `c_val + m_val`. After the operation, `c` will be updated to `(c_val + m_val) + m_val`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect this change:

Output State: **`res` is `res_initial + b_i * m_val + 2 * c_val * m_val + b[i+1] * m_val + m_val^2`, `b[i]` is `b[i+1]`, `c` is `(c_val + m_val) + m_val`, `m` is `m_val`**
