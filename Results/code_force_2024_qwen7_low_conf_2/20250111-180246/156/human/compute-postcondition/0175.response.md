`b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial conditions, `leng` is incremented by 1 only if `a[i]` is in set `s` and `leng < k // m`, and `b` includes `a[i]` under the same condition. Since the code only appends `a[i]` to `b` regardless of the condition, the value of `b` will include `a[i]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `leng`, and `k` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1 more than it was in the previous iteration, `leng` remains unchanged or is incremented by 1 depending on the conditions, `k` remains unchanged, `b` includes `a[i]`.**
