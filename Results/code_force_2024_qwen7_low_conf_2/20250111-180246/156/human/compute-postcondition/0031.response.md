The code snippet updates the variable `res` by adding the product of `(b[i] + c) * m` to its current value. Given the initial state, we know that:

- `res` is `res_initial + (b_i + c_val) * m_val`
- `b[i]` is `b[i+1]`
- `c` is `c_val + m_val`
- `m` is `m_val`

Let's calculate the new value of `res` step-by-step.

1. The current value of `res` is `res_initial + (b_i + c_val) * m_val`.
2. The new value of `b[i]` is `b[i+1]`.
3. The value of `c` remains `c_val + m_val`.
4. The value of `m` remains `m_val`.

Now, the updated `res` will be the sum of its current value and the product `(b[i] + c) * m`. Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{New } res = (\text{res_initial} + (b_i + c_val) * m_val) + ((b[i+1] + (c_val + m_val)) * m_val) \]

Simplifying the expression:

\[ \text{New } res = \text{res_initial} + (b_i + c_val) * m_val + (b[i+1] + c_val + m_val) * m_val \]
\[ \text{New } res = \text{res_initial} + (b_i + c_val) * m_val + b[i+1] * m_val + c_val * m_val + m_val * m_val \]
\[ \text{New } res = \text{res_initial} + b_i * m_val + c_val * m_val + b[i+1] * m_val + c_val * m_val + m_val^2 \]
\[ \text{New } res = \text{res_initial} + b_i * m_val + 2 * c_val * m_val + b[i+1] * m_val + m_val^2 \]

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`res` is `res_initial + b_i * m_val + 2 * c_val * m_val + b[i+1] * m_val + m_val^2`, `b[i]` is `b[i+1]`, `c` is `c_val + m_val`, `m` is `m_val`**
