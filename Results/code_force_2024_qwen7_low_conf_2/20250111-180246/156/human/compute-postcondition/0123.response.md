`leng` is incremented by 1. The value of `leng` was originally less than `k // m + 1`, so after incrementing, it is now one more than its original value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1; `a[i]` is in set `s`; `leng` is less than `k // m + 1` + 1; `b` contains the element `a[i]`**
