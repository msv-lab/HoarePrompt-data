Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is `None`, `mx_ind_lt` is `-1`, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b` during the loop execution, `b` is a list containing the elements from `a` that meet the condition `a[i] in s` and `leng < k // m`.**
