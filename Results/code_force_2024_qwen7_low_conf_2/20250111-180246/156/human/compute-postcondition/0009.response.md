The code initializes an empty list `b`. This operation does not affect the values of the previously defined variables. Therefore, the only change is the addition of an empty list `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 0, `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `k` is greater than `m`, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is an empty list**.
