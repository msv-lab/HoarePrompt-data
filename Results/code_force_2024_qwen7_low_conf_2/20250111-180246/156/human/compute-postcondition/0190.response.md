`c` is incremented by `m`. The value of `c` was previously `c + (m + m)`, so now `c` is `c + 2*m`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` must have at least one element, `res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * m`, `c` is `c + 2*m`.

Output State: **`b` must have at least one element, `res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * m`, `c` is `c + 2*m`**
