The code `leng += 1` increments the value of `leng` by 1. Since `leng` can either remain unchanged or be incremented by 1, the only certain change is the increment by 1. The values of `n`, `i`, `k`, and `b` remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `i` is 1 more than it was in the previous iteration, `leng` is incremented by 1, `k` remains unchanged, `b` includes `a[i]`.**
