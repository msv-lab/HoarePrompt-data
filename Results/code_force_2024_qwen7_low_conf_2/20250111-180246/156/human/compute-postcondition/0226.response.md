Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `b` contains at least one element, `leng` is at least 1, `res` is updated by adding `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` to its current value, `mx` and `mx_ind_lt` remain the same unless the current value of `b[i_prev + 1]` changes the maximum value or its index, `s` and `c` remain the same unless modified within the loop, `i` starts from `i_prev + 1`.**
