The code increments the variable `leng` by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` must be less than `n`, and `b` contains the element `a[i]` appended to it. However, the variable `leng` is not mentioned in the initial state, which implies it might not exist initially or its value is unknown. After executing the line `leng += 1`, `leng` is now 1 more than whatever its original value was. Since the original value of `leng` is not specified, we can only say that `leng` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` must be less than `n`; `b` contains the element `a[i]` appended to it; `leng` is 1 more than its original value**
