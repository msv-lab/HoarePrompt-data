Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the length of `b`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and not divisible by `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list containing at most \((k // m) + 1\) elements, each element being an integer from `a` that is also in `s` and satisfying the condition `leng < k // m + 1`, `res` is the accumulated result based on the conditions inside the loop, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in the list `b`, and `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`. If `k % m == 0`, `res` is the sum of `(b[i] + c_initial) * m` for all `i` from `0` to `leng - 1`, `c` is `c_initial + leng * m`, and `leng` is `k // m`; otherwise, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is equal to the length of `b`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and not divisible by `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list containing at most \((k // m) + 1\) elements, each element being an integer from `a` that is also in `s` and satisfying the condition `leng < k // m + 1`, `res` is the accumulated result based on the conditions inside the loop, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in the list `b`, and `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`.***
