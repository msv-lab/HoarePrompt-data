Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `b` must have at least one element.
   - `res` is updated to `res + (b[i] + c) * m`.
   - `c` is incremented by `m`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(len(b)):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Variables and Their Changes:**
   - `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration of the loop.
   - `res` is updated based on the current value of `b[i]`, `c`, and `m`.
   - `c` is incremented by `m` at the end of the loop.

4. **Determining the Next Iteration's State:**
   - For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than `len(b)`.
   - Since `i` starts from 0 and increments by 1, we need to find the next valid `i` value.
   - The condition for the next iteration is that `i` should be less than `len(b)`.

5. **Current Values:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is one less than its value at the start of the current iteration.
   - Let's denote the current value of `i` as `i_current`.
   - The next value of `i` would be `i_current + 1`.

6. **State Adjustments:**
   - `i` will be `i_current + 1`.
   - `res` will be updated again based on the new value of `i`.
   - `c` will be incremented by `m` once more.

Given these points, let's formulate the state for the next iteration:

- Since `i` was one less than its value at the start of the current iteration, let's assume `i` was `i_current` at the start of the current iteration.
- The next value of `i` will be `i_current + 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**`b` must have at least one element, `res` is updated to `res + (b[i_current + 1] + c) * m`, `c` is incremented by `m`.**

State: **`b` must have at least one element, `res` is updated to `res + (b[i_current + 1] + c) * m`, `c` is incremented by `m`.**
