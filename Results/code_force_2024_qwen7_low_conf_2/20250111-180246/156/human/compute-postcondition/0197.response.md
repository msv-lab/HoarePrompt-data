The given code initializes an empty list `b`. This means that no new elements are added to `b` or `c`, and no operations are performed on `mx`, `mx_ind_lt`, `s`, `leng`, or `res` since they are not referenced in the code snippet.

Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged from their initial states. The only change is that `b` is now an empty list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is the length of `b` + 1, `n` is the integer read from the input, `m` is the integer read from the input, `k` is the integer read from the input, `a` is now a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value after the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in the list `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, `leng` is the number of elements added to `b` during the loop execution, `b` is an empty list, `res` is the final value after the loop.**
