Postcondition: ***`b` contains at least one element, `c` is increased by `(k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `m`. `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)` if the condition `b[i] == mx and i == mx_ind_lt` is met, otherwise it is increased by `(b[i] + c) * m`.***
