`b.append(a[i])` appends the current value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Given the initial conditions, the value of `a[i]` is currently in the set `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m`, so the value of `a[i]` is added to `b`.

The other variables remain unchanged because the code does not affect them. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `c` is the final value of `c` based on the conditions inside the loop, `mx` is None, `mx_ind_lt` is -1, `s` is a set containing the smallest `k // m` unique elements from the sorted list `a`, `leng` is 0, and `b` is a list with the value `a[i]` appended to it.**
