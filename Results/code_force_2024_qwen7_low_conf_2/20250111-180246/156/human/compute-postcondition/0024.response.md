Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is `n`, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and `k` is greater than `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list containing up to `k // m` elements from `a` where each element is only included if it is in `s`, and `leng` is `k // m`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates `n` times.
- For each iteration, if `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng` is less than `k // m`, then `a[i]` is appended to `b` and `leng` is incremented.
- After `n` iterations, `i` will be `n`.
- Since the loop will continue until `leng` reaches `k // m` (or more), the maximum value `leng` can take is `k // m`. Therefore, `leng` will be exactly `k // m` when the loop finishes.

This covers all possible cases, including the scenario where the loop does not execute at all (if `n` is 0) and the scenario where `leng` reaches `k // m` within the loop iterations.
