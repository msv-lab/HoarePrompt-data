`res` is incremented by the value of `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)`, where `i` is the index of the maximum element in `b` that is less than or equal to `mx_ind_lt`, and `mx` is the maximum element in `b` at that index. The states of the other variables are not directly affected.

Output State: **`b` contains at least one element, the maximum element `mx` in `b` is equal to `b[i]` where `i` is the index of the maximum element in `b` that is less than or equal to `mx_ind_lt`, and `res` is increased by `(b[i] + c) * (k % m)`**
