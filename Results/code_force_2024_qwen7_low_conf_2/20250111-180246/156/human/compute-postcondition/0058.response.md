The code `mx_ind_lt = max(i for i in range(len(b)) if b[i] == mx)` checks for the index of the maximum value `mx` in the list `b`. However, this operation does not change the values of any variables; it only assigns a value to `mx_ind_lt`. The value of `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`.

Since the value of `mx` itself is not altered by this operation, and no new variables are introduced, the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `i` is equal to `n`; `n` must be greater than 0; `m` is an input integer; `k` is an input integer not divisible by `m`; `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input; `s` is a set containing the first \((k // m) + 1\) elements of the sorted list `a`; `b` is a list containing at most \((k // m) + 1\) elements, each element being an integer from `a` that is also in `s` and satisfying the condition `leng < k // m + 1`; `leng` is equal to the number of elements added to `b` and is at most \((k // m) + 1`; `c` is 0; `res` is 0; `mx` is the maximum value in the list `b`; `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`.**
