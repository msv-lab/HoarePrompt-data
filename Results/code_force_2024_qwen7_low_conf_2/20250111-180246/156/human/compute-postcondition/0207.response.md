Postcondition: **`n` must be greater than 0, `i` is incremented by 1. If the element at index `i` of `a` (denoted as `a[i]`) is in set `s` and the length of some list (referred to as `leng`) is less than `k // m + 1`, then `b` is updated by appending the element at index `i` of `a` and `leng` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the state of `b` and `leng` remains unchanged.**
