`c` is incremented by `m`. The value of `res` is updated based on the initial state, which means `res` is now `(b[i] + c) * m`. Since `b` contains at least one element and `i` is not equal to `mx` or `i` is not equal to `mx_ind_lt`, these conditions remain unchanged. The output state reflects the updated value of `c` and the updated value of `res`.

Output State: **`res` is increased by (b[i] + c) * m, c is increased by m, b contains at least one element, i is not equal to mx or i is not equal to mx_ind_lt**
