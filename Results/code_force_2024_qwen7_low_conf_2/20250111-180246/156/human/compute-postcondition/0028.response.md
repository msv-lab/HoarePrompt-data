The code `res += (b[i] + c) * m` updates the value of `res` by adding `(b[i] + c) * m` to its current value. However, the initial values of `res`, `b[i]`, `c`, and `m` are not specified in the initial state. Let's denote the initial value of `res` as `res_initial`, the value of `b[i]` as `b_i`, the value of `c` as `c_val`, and the value of `m` as `m_val`.

The updated value of `res` will be `res_initial + (b_i + c_val) * m_val`.

Since the initial values are not provided, we cannot specify exact numerical values. But we can represent the updated state of the variables.

Output State: **`res` is `res_initial + (b_i + c_val) * m_val`, `b[i]` is `b_i`, `c` is `c_val`, `m` is `m_val`.**
