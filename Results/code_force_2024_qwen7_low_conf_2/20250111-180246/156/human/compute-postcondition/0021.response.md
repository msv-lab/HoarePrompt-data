`b` is appended with `a[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `b` will append `a[2]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and `k` is greater than `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list with one additional element `a[2]` appended, and `leng` is 1 or 3.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and `k` is greater than `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list with one additional element `a[2]` appended, and `leng` is 1 or 3.**
