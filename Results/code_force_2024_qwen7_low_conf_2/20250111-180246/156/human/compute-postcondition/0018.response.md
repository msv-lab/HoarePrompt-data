The value of `leng` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `leng` can be either 0 or 2, so after adding 1, it will become 1 or 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is either 1 or 2, `n` must be greater than 0, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and `k` is greater than `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list with either no additional elements or one additional element `a[i]` appended, and `leng` is 1 or 3.**
