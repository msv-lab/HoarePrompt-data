Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `i` is 2, `n` must be at least 2, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer and `k` is greater than `m`, `a` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `s` is a set containing the first `k // m` elements of the sorted list `a`, `b` is a list with either no additional elements or one additional element `a[2]` appended, and `leng` is 2 or 4. If `a[i]` is in `s` and `leng < k // m`, then `leng` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `leng` remains unchanged.***
