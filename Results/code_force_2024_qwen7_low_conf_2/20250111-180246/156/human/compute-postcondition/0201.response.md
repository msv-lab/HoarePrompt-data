`b.append(a[i])` appends the value of `a[i]` to the list `b`. Since `a[i]` is in `s`, it means `a[i]` is one of the elements in the set `s`. The other variables are not affected, so they remain as per the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `a[i]` is in `s`, `leng` is less than `k // m + 1`, `b` contains `a[i]`**
