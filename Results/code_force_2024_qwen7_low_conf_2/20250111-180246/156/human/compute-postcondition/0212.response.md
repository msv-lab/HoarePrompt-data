Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `b` is a list containing the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the first `n` elements of `a` if those elements satisfy the condition `a[i] in s` and `leng < k // m + 1`, otherwise `b` remains unchanged. `leng` is the number of elements appended to `b` if the condition is satisfied, otherwise `leng` remains unchanged. `i` is `n` after the loop. `res` is the same as `c` before the loop, `mx` is the last maximum value in `b`, `mx_ind_lt` is the index of the last occurrence of `mx` in `b`, and `s` is the set of the smallest `k // m + 1` unique elements from the sorted list `a`.**
