Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts a list `b` of non-negative integers and calculates the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list. It then returns this difference. Potential edge cases include an empty list, where the function would raise a `ValueError` due to the `min()` and `max()` functions being applied to an empty sequence. The function also assumes that the list contains only non-negative integers; any other type of input would result in incorrect behavior or a `TypeError`.**
