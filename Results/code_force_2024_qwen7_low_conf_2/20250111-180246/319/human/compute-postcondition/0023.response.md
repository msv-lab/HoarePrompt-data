The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the upper bound of the range of values for the input; `q`, which is a positive integer representing the number of queries; and `encrypted_values`, which is a list of `q` integers representing the encrypted values of `v` for each query. After executing the function body, it returns a list `results` of length `q`, where each element corresponds to the value of `last` after the corresponding iteration of the loop and is the final value returned by `func_2(a)`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `n`, `q`, and `encrypted_values`, and return a list `results` of length `q`, where each element is the final value returned by `func_2(a)` after the corresponding iteration of the loop.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `q`, and `encrypted_values`, and returns a list `results` of length `q`, where each element is the final value returned by `func_2(a)` after the corresponding iteration of the loop.**
