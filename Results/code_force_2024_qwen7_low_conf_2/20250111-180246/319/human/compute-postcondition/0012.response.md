First, let's break down the initial state and the code snippet:

- Initial State:
  - `n` is a positive integer
  - `q` is a positive integer greater than 1
  - `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers
  - `a` is defined as `[encrypted_values[0] % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + encrypted_values[0] % n) % n]`
  - `last` is `f_a`
  - `results` is a list containing `f_a`
  - `i` is 3
  - `v` is `(encrypted_values[2] % n + f_a) % n`

Code Snippet:
```python
f_a = func_2(a)
```

Here, `func_2(a)` is called and its result is assigned to `f_a`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the given context. We will assume that `func_2` returns a value based on the input `a`.

Let's denote the result of `func_2(a)` as `result_of_func_2`. So, `f_a` is now set to this result.

Updated State:
- `f_a` is updated to `result_of_func_2` (the value returned by `func_2(a)`).

The other variables remain unchanged based on the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer greater than 1, `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers, `a` is `[encrypted_values[0] % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + encrypted_values[0] % n) % n]`, `last` is `result_of_func_2`, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_2`, `i` is 3, `v` is `(encrypted_values[2] % n + result_of_func_2) % n`**
