The code updates the value of `last` to be equal to `f_a`. The previous value of `last` was `f_a`, and the previous value of `f_a` was the value returned by `func_2(a)`. Therefore, the value of `last` now is the same as the value of `f_a`, which is the value returned by `func_2(a)`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer greater than 1, `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers, `a` is `[encrypted_values[0] % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + encrypted_values[0] % n) % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + last) % n]`, `last` is the value returned by `func_2(a)`, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_2` and `f_a`, `i` is 4, `v` is `(encrypted_values[2] % n + last) % n`**
