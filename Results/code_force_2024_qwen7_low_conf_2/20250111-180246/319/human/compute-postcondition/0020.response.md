Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `q` is a positive integer greater than 1
   - `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers
   - `a` is defined as `[encrypted_values[0] % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + encrypted_values[0] % n) % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + last) % n]`, where `last` is the value returned by `func_2(a)`
   - `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_2` and `f_a`
   - `i` is 4
   - `v` is `(encrypted_values[2] % n + last) % n`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   results.append(f_a)
   ```

3. The impact of this code is that it appends the value of `f_a` to the `results` list.

Given this, let's update the variables and list their current states:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `q` remains a positive integer greater than 1.
- `encrypted_values` remains a list of `q` integers.
- `a` remains as defined.
- `last` remains as the value returned by `func_2(a)`.
- `results` now contains `[result_of_func_2, f_a]` since `f_a` is appended to it.
- `i` remains 4.
- `v` remains `(encrypted_values[2] % n + last) % n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer greater than 1, `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers, `a` is `[encrypted_values[0] % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + encrypted_values[0] % n) % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + last) % n]`, `last` is the value returned by `func_2(a)`, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_2` and `f_a`, `i` is 4, `v` is `(encrypted_values[2] % n + last) % n`**
