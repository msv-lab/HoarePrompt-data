The code snippet assigns the value of `f_a` to the variable `last`. The value of `f_a` is not explicitly defined in the provided initial state, so we will denote it as `f_a` in the output state.

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `q` is a positive integer greater than 1.
- `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers.
- `a` is defined as `[encrypted_values[0] % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + encrypted_values[0] % n) % n]`.
- `last` is updated to be equal to `f_a`.
- `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_2`.
- `i` is 3.
- `v` is `(encrypted_values[2] % n + result_of_func_2) % n`.

After the code executes, the only change is that `last` is now equal to `f_a`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer greater than 1, `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers, `a` is `[encrypted_values[0] % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + encrypted_values[0] % n) % n]`, `last` is `f_a`, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_2`, `i` is 3, `v` is `(encrypted_values[2] % n + result_of_func_2) % n`**
