Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers, `a` is a list of length `q`, where each element is computed as `(encrypted_values[i] + last) % n` for `i` from 0 to `q-1`, `last` is the final value returned by `func_2(a)`, `results` is a list of length `q`, where each element is the value of `last` after the corresponding iteration of the loop, `i` is `q+1`, and `v` is the value used in the `i`-th iteration of the loop.**

Explanation:
- `n` remains a positive integer throughout the loop.
- `q` remains a positive integer representing the number of queries.
- `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers.
- `a` is constructed such that each element is calculated as `(encrypted_values[i] + last) % n` for each iteration `i` from 0 to `q-1`.
- `last` is the final value returned by `func_2(a)` after the loop completes.
- `results` is a list of length `q`, where each element is the value of `last` after the corresponding iteration of the loop.
- `i` will be `q+1` after the loop finishes, indicating that the loop has completed `q` iterations.
- `v` is the value used in the `i`-th iteration of the loop, which is `(encrypted_values[i] + last) % n` for `i` from 0 to `q-1`.

This state accurately reflects the values and relationships of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished, considering both the cases where the loop does and does not execute any iterations.
