Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `n` is a positive integer
   - `q` is a positive integer greater than 1
   - `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers
   - `a` is `[encrypted_values[0] % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + encrypted_values[0] % n) % n]`
   - `last` is `f_a`
   - `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_2` and `f_a`
   - `i` is 3
   - `v` is `(encrypted_values[2] % n + result_of_func_2) % n`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(q):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Determine the Next State:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(q)`, meaning it will run `q` times.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `q`.
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` will be `4`.
   - Since `i` increases by 1 with each iteration, we only need to update `i`.

4. **Adjust the States:**
   - `n` remains unchanged as there are no operations involving `n` within the loop.
   - `q` remains unchanged as there are no operations involving `q` within the loop.
   - `encrypted_values` remains unchanged as there are no operations involving `encrypted_values` within the loop.
   - `a` remains unchanged as there are no operations involving `a` within the loop.
   - `last` remains unchanged as there are no operations involving `last` within the loop.
   - `results` remains unchanged as there are no operations involving `results` within the loop.
   - `v` remains unchanged as there are no operations involving `v` within the loop.

5. **Final State for the Start of Next Iteration:**
   - `i` becomes `4`.

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer greater than 1, `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers, `a` is `[encrypted_values[0] % n, (encrypted_values[2] % n + encrypted_values[0] % n) % n]`, `last` is `f_a`, `results` is a list containing `result_of_func_2` and `f_a`, `i` is 4, `v` is `(encrypted_values[2] % n + result_of_func_2) % n`**
