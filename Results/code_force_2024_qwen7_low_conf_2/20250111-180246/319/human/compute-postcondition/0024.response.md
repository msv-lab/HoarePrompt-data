Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `q` (a positive integer), and `encrypted_values` (a list of `q` integers). It initializes an empty list `a`, a variable `last` set to 0, and an empty list `results`. For each query in the range `q`, it calculates `v` as `(encrypted_values[i] + last) % n`, appends `v` to `a`, calls another function `func_2(a)` to get the updated `last`, and appends `last` to `results`. After the loop, the function returns `results`, which contains the final value of `last` after each iteration of the loop, as determined by `func_2(a)`. If `func_2(a)` is not defined or fails, the function will still execute but may produce unexpected results. Potential edge cases include when `n` or `q` is 0, or when `encrypted_values` is an empty list, which should be handled appropriately in `func_2(a)`.**
