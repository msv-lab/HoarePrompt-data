`min_val` is assigned the value of the minimum element in the list `b`. The value of `max_val` remains unchanged as it was previously defined as the maximum value in `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `b` is a list of non-negative integers, `max_val` is the maximum value in `b`, and `min_val` is the minimum value in `b`.

Output State: **`b` is a list of non-negative integers, `max_val` is the maximum value in `b`, `min_val` is the minimum value in `b`**
