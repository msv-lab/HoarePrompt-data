The code `f_a = func_2(a)` assigns the result of the function call `func_2(a)` to the variable `f_a`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined in the provided code snippet, and its behavior is unknown. Without knowing what `func_2` does, we cannot determine the exact value of `f_a`. The only changes made to the variables are that `f_a` is now assigned the return value of `func_2(a)`, and the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the upper bound of the range of values for the input, `q` is a positive integer representing the number of queries, `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers representing the encrypted values of `v` for each query, `a` is `[encrypted_values[0] % n]`, `last` is 0, `results` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `v` is `encrypted_values[i] % n`, and `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`**.
