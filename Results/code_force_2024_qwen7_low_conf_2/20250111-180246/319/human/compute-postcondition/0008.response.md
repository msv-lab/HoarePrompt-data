`results` is appended with the value of `f_a`. The value of `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`, and `a` is initialized as `[encrypted_values[0] % n]`. No other variables are affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the upper bound of the range of values for the input, `q` is a positive integer representing the number of queries, `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers representing the encrypted values of `v` for each query, `a` is `[encrypted_values[0] % n]`, `last` is `f_a`, `results` is a list containing `f_a`, `i` is 1, `q` is greater than 0, `v` is `encrypted_values[i] % n`, and `f_a` is the return value of `func_2(a)`**
