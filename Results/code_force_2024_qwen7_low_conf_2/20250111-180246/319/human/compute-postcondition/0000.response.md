The code `max_val = max(b)` finds the maximum value in the list `b` and assigns it to the variable `max_val`. The other variables remain unchanged. The output state will include the updated value of `max_val`.

Output State: **`b` is a list of non-negative integers, `max_val` is the maximum value in `b`.**
