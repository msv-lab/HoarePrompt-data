#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the upper bound of the range of values for the input, q is a positive integer representing the number of queries, and encrypted_values is a list of q integers representing the encrypted values of v for each query.
def func_1(n, q, encrypted_values):
    a = []
    last = 0
    results = []
    for i in range(q):
        v = (encrypted_values[i] + last) % n
        
        a.append(v)

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `q` is a positive integer, `encrypted_values` is a list of `q` integers, `a` is a list of length `q`, where each element is computed as `(encrypted_values[i] + last) % n` for `i` from 0 to `q-1`, `last` is the final value returned by `func_2(a)`, `results` is a list of length `q`, where each element is the value of `last` after the corresponding iteration of the loop, `i` is `q+1`, and `v` is the value used in the `i`-th iteration of the loop.
    return results
    #The program returns a list `results` of length `q`, where each element is the value of `last` after the corresponding iteration of the loop, and `last` is the final value returned by `func_2(a)`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `q` (a positive integer), and `encrypted_values` (a list of `q` integers). It initializes an empty list `a`, a variable `last` set to 0, and an empty list `results`. For each query in the range `q`, it calculates `v` as `(encrypted_values[i] + last) % n`, appends `v` to `a`, calls another function `func_2(a)` to get the updated `last`, and appends `last` to `results`. After the loop, the function returns `results`, which contains the final value of `last` after each iteration of the loop, as determined by `func_2(a)`. If `func_2(a)` is not defined or fails, the function will still execute but may produce unexpected results. Potential edge cases include when `n` or `q` is 0, or when `encrypted_values` is an empty list, which should be handled appropriately in `func_2(a)`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: b is a list of non-negative integers, representing the current state of array a after processing some queries.
def func_2(b):
    max_val = max(b)
    min_val = min(b)
    return max_val - min_val
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum value (`max_val`) and the minimum value (`min_val`) in list `b`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts a list `b` of non-negative integers and calculates the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list. It then returns this difference. Potential edge cases include an empty list, where the function would raise a `ValueError` due to the `min()` and `max()` functions being applied to an empty sequence. The function also assumes that the list contains only non-negative integers; any other type of input would result in incorrect behavior or a `TypeError`.
