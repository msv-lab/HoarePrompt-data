### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The goal is to compute \( f(a) \) for each query after appending \( v \) to the array \( a \).
   - \( f(b) \) is defined as the maximum value of \(\max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \( x \), where \( | \) is the bitwise OR operation.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` currently calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b` without considering the bitwise OR operation with any variable \( x \).
   - This means `func_2` does not accurately reflect the definition of \( f(b) \) as it ignores the essential bitwise OR component.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through each query, updates the array `a` with the current value `v`, and calls `func_2` to compute `f(a)` after each update.
   - It stores the result of `func_2` in `last` and uses it in the next iteration.
   - The results list is populated with these computed values.

4. **Correctness of the Program**:
   - Given the problem description, `func_2` must account for the bitwise OR operation with every possible non-negative integer \( x \) to compute \( f(b) \).
   - The current implementation of `func_2` does not consider the bitwise OR operation with different values of \( x \), thus it does not compute \( f(b) \) correctly.
   - To properly compute \( f(b) \), one would need to find the maximum and minimum values of \( b_i | x \) for all \( x \), which is computationally intensive and cannot be done in a single pass as implemented here.

Based on the above analysis, the program as written does not correctly implement the definition of \( f(b) \). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
