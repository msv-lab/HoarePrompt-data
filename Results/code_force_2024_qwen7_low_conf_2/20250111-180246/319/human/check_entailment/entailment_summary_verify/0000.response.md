Reasoning:

The original assessment is inaccurate. Let's analyze the program and the function summaries step-by-step.

### Function Analysis:
1. **Function 1 (`func_1`)**:
   - This function processes the encrypted values to get the actual values for the array `a`.
   - It uses `func_2` to compute `f(a)` for each appended value.
   - The function iterates through the encrypted values, calculates the actual value `v` for each query, appends it to `a`, and then calls `func_2` to compute `f(a)`.

2. **Function 2 (`func_2`)**:
   - This function computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b`.
   - The function summary correctly describes its behavior and potential edge cases (empty list, non-negative integers only).

### Correctness of the Implementation:
- The function `func_2` correctly implements the computation of `f(a)` as described in the problem statement. It finds the maximum and minimum values in the array and returns their difference, which is exactly what the problem requires for `f(a)`.
- The function `func_1` correctly processes the encrypted values and updates the array `a` and the result list `results` accordingly.

### Test Case Analysis:
Let's verify the example provided in the original assessment with the given function implementation:

- **Test Case 1:**
  - \( n = 7 \), \( q = 2 \)
  - Encrypted values: \( 1, 2 \)

  **Steps:**
  1. \( v = (1 + 0) \% 7 = 1 \)
     - \( a = [1] \)
     - \( f(a) = 0 \) (since all elements are the same)
  2. \( v = (2 + 1) \% 7 = 3 \)
     - \( a = [1, 3] \)
     - \( f(a) = 2 \) (since \( 1 \text{ OR } 3 = 3 \) and \( 3 \text{ OR } 3 = 3 \))

  The output should be `[0, 2]`, which matches the provided solution.

- **Test Case 2:**
  - \( n = 7 \), \( q = 4 \)
  - Encrypted values: \( 3, 1, 5, 2 \)

  **Steps:**
  1. \( v = (3 + 0) \% 7 = 3 \)
     - \( a = [3] \)
     - \( f(a) = 0 \)
  2. \( v = (1 + 3) \% 7 = 4 \)
     - \( a = [3, 4] \)
     - \( f(a) = 4 \) (since \( 3 \text{ OR } 4 = 7 \))
  3. \( v = (5 + 4) \% 7 = 2 \)
     - \( a = [3, 4, 2] \)
     - \( f(a) = 5 \) (since \( 3 \text{ OR } 4 = 7 \), \( 3 \text{ OR } 2 = 3 \), \( 4 \text{ OR } 2 = 6 \))
  4. \( v = (2 + 5) \% 7 = 0 \)
     - \( a = [3, 4, 2, 0] \)
     - \( f(a) = 7 \) (since \( 3 \text{ OR } 4 = 7 \), \( 3 \text{ OR } 2 = 3 \), \( 3 \text{ OR } 0 = 3 \), \( 4 \text{ OR } 2 = 6 \), \( 4 \text{ OR } 0 = 4 \), \( 2 \text{ OR } 0 = 2 \))

  The output should be `[0, 4, 5, 7]`, which matches the provided solution.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the required functionality according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **False**
