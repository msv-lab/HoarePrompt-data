Reasoning: 
To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that both `func_1` and `func_2` behave as expected according to the problem statement and the provided annotations.

1. **Function `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list `b`.
   - This computation aligns with the definition of \( f(b) \) in the problem, which is \(\max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\).
   - Since the bitwise OR operation is applied to every element of `b` with `x`, and the goal is to find the maximum and minimum values of these operations, the function correctly computes the difference.

2. **Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` processes `q` queries and updates the array `a` accordingly.
   - For each query, it calculates the new value `v` using the provided formula: \((e_i + \text{last}) \% n\).
   - It then appends `v` to `a`, computes `f(a)` using `func_2`, updates `last` to the result of `f(a)`, and stores this value in `results`.
   - The process ensures that the state of `a` is updated correctly based on the query and the previous results.

3. **Overall Program Logic:**
   - The main program iterates over each test case, reads the input, and calls `func_1` to process the queries.
   - The output format matches the requirement, as the results are printed in the form specified.

Given the detailed analysis:
- Both functions are correctly implemented to meet the problem's requirements.
- There are no logical errors or inconsistencies in the implementation.

Therefore, the overall logic and implementation of the program are correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

Correctness: **True**
