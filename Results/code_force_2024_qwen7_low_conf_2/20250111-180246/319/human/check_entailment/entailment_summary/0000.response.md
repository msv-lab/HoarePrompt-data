Reasoning: 
1. **Understanding the Problem and Given Functions**:
   - The problem involves processing a series of queries to an array `a` and computing a function `f(a)` for each appended value.
   - `f(a)` is defined as the maximum value of \(\max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \(x\).
   - The provided functions are:
     - `func_1`: This function processes the queries and updates the array `a` while calculating `f(a)` for each query.
     - `func_2`: This function computes `f(a)` for a given array `b`.

2. **Analysis of `func_2`**:
   - `func_2` correctly computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b` using bitwise OR operations. However, the problem statement suggests that `f(a)` should be calculated based on the maximum and minimum values of \(b_i | x\) for all \(x\). In the current implementation, `func_2` does not account for different values of \(x\); it simply finds the maximum and minimum values in the array `b` and returns their difference. This is not consistent with the definition of `f(a)`.

3. **Analysis of `func_1`**:
   - `func_1` correctly implements the logic to process the queries and update the array `a` while calculating `f(a)` for each query.
   - It uses `func_2` to compute `f(a)` at each step, but since `func_2` does not correctly implement `f(a)` as defined, the results produced by `func_1` will not match the expected output.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since `func_2` does not correctly implement the definition of `f(a)`, the overall program cannot produce the correct output according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**
