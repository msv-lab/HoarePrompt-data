You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
For an array b of m non-negative integers, define f(b) as the maximum value of \max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) over all possible non-negative integers x , where | is [bitwise OR operation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitwise_operation#OR).

You are given integers n and q . You start with an empty array a . Process the
following q queries:

  * v : append v to the back of a and then output f(a) . It is guaranteed that 0 \leq v < n . 

The queries are given in a modified way.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the number of test cases. The
description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and q (1 \leq n \leq
2^{22} , 1 \leq q \leq 10^6 ) — the number of queries.

The second line of each test case contains q space-separated integers
e_1,e_2,\ldots,e_q (0 \leq e_i < n ) — the encrypted values of v .

Let \mathrm{last}_i equal the output of the (i-1) -th query for i\geq 2 and
\mathrm{last}_i=0 for i=1 . Then the value of v for the i -th query is (e_i +
\mathrm{last}_i ) modulo n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2^{22}
and the sum of q over all test cases does not exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print q integers. The i -th integer is the output of the i
-th query.

Example

Input

    2
    
    5 2
    
    1 2
    
    7 4
    
    3 1 5 2

Output

    0 2
    0 2 3 5
    
Note

In the first test case, the final a=[1,2] . For i=1 , the answer is always 0 ,
irrespective of x . For i=2 , we can select x=5 .

In the second test case, the final a=[3,1,0,5] .

# Functions with Execution Summary:
t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (n, q) = map(int, input().split())
    encrypted_values = list(map(int, input().split()))
    results = func_1(n, q, encrypted_values)
    print(' '.join(map(str, results)))

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n, q, encrypted_values):
    a = []
    last = 0
    results = []
    for i in range(q):
        v = (encrypted_values[i] + last) % n
        a.append(v)
        f_a = func_2(a)
        last = f_a
        results.append(f_a)
    return results
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n` (a positive integer), `q` (a positive integer), and `encrypted_values` (a list of `q` integers). It initializes an empty list `a`, a variable `last` set to 0, and an empty list `results`. For each query in the range `q`, it calculates `v` as `(encrypted_values[i] + last) % n`, appends `v` to `a`, calls another function `func_2(a)` to get the updated `last`, and appends `last` to `results`. After the loop, the function returns `results`, which contains the final value of `last` after each iteration of the loop, as determined by `func_2(a)`. If `func_2(a)` is not defined or fails, the function will still execute but may produce unexpected results. Potential edge cases include when `n` or `q` is 0, or when `encrypted_values` is an empty list, which should be handled appropriately in `func_2(a)`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(b):
    max_val = max(b)
    min_val = min(b)
    return max_val - min_val
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts a list `b` of non-negative integers and calculates the difference between the maximum value and the minimum value in the list. It then returns this difference. Potential edge cases include an empty list, where the function would raise a `ValueError` due to the `min()` and `max()` functions being applied to an empty sequence. The function also assumes that the list contains only non-negative integers; any other type of input would result in incorrect behavior or a `TypeError`.
