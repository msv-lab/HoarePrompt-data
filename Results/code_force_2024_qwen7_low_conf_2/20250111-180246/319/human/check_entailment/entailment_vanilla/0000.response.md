Reasoning:
1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to compute `f(a)` for each query after appending `v` to the array `a`. The function `func_2` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum bitwise OR values in the array.
2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**: 
   - This function correctly computes the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b` using bitwise OR operation.
   - However, it only considers the bitwise OR of elements in the array, not the bitwise OR of each element with a variable `x`.
3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function iterates through each query, updating the array `a` with the current value `v`.
   - It calls `func_2` to compute `f(a)` after each update and stores this result in `last` for the next iteration.
   - The results list is populated with these computed values.

Given the definition of `f(b)`, which involves the bitwise OR of each element with a variable `x`, the function `func_2` does not fully capture the required computation because it only finds the maximum and minimum values directly without considering the bitwise OR operations across all elements with some `x`.

**Conclusion**: The given program is incorrect because it does not implement the actual definition of `f(b)`. Therefore, the correct response is:

Correctness: **False**
