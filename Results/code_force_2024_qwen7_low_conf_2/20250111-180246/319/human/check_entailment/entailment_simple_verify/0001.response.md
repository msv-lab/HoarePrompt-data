### Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - The problem requires computing `f(a)` for each query after appending `v` to the array `a`. The function `f(a)` is defined as the maximum value of \(\max\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x) - \min\limits_{i = 1}^{m} (b_i | x)\) over all possible non-negative integers \(x\), where \(|\) is the bitwise OR operation.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_2` currently calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `b` directly, without considering the bitwise OR operation with any `x`. This is a simplified version of the problem and does not match the required definition of `f(b)`.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function `func_1` iterates through each query, updating the array `a` with the current value `v`. It calls `func_2` to compute `f(a)` after each update and stores this result in `last` for the next iteration.
   - The results list is populated with these computed values. However, since `func_2` does not correctly compute `f(a)` (it only considers direct max and min values), the results will be incorrect.

4. **Original Assessment Evaluation**:
   - The original assessment correctly identifies that `func_2` does not implement the required definition of `f(b)`, as it only considers the direct max and min values without the bitwise OR operation with `x`.
   - The conclusion that the given program is incorrect because `func_2` does not implement the full definition of `f(b)` is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:

Given the above analysis, the original assessment correctly identifies that the program is incorrect due to the implementation of `func_2` not fully capturing the required definition of `f(b)`.

**Final: False**

This conclusion is based on the fact that the program does not correctly implement the definition of `f(b)` as specified in the problem statement.
