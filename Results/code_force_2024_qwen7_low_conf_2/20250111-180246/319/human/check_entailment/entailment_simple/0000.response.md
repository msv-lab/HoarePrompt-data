Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here's a detailed breakdown of why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Initialization and Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases `t`.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n` and `q`, followed by the encrypted values of `v` for `q` queries.
   - It correctly initializes the arrays and variables (`a`, `last`, and `results`).

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, it calculates the actual value of `v` using the formula `(encrypted_values[i] + last) % n`.
   - It appends this value to the array `a`.
   - It computes `f(a)` using the `func_2` function, which calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `a`.
   - It updates `last` with the result of `func_2(a)` and appends this value to the `results` list.

3. **Final Output:**
   - After processing all queries, it prints the results list, which contains the outputs of each query.

4. **Function Definitions:**
   - `func_2` correctly computes `f(a)` as defined in the problem statement, which is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array `a`.

The program correctly follows the problem description in handling the queries, updating the array `a`, computing the required function value `f(a)` for each query, and producing the correct output. There are no cases where the program deviates from the problem statement, and it handles all given inputs as specified.

Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
