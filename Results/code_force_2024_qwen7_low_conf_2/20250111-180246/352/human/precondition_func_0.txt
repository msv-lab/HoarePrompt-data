t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of n (the number of containers) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the initial amounts of water in each container. It is also guaranteed that the sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
