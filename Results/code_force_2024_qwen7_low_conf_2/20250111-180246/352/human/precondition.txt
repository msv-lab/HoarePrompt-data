t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. For each test case, n is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 \cdot 10^5, and a is a list of n non-negative integers such that 0 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and the sum of a_i is divisible by n. Additionally, the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
