You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program: 
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        a = (*map(int, s.split()),)
        u = sum(a) // len(a)
        d = f = 0
        for x in a:
            d += x - u
            f |= d
        print('YNEOS'[f < 0::2])



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer representing the number of test cases, where each test case consists of n (the number of containers) and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n representing the initial amounts of water in each container. It is also guaranteed that the sum of a_i for each test case is divisible by n, and the sum of n across all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^5.
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        a = *map(int, s.split()),
        
        u = sum(a) // len(a)
        
        d = f = 0
        
        for x in a:
            d += x - u
            f |= d
        
        print('YNEOS'[f < 0::2])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a positive integer, for each test case, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `u` is the average of the elements in `a`, `d` is the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `a` and `u`, `f` is the bitwise OR of all values of `d` calculated in each iteration, and the output is 'Y' if `f` is not less than 0, or 'N' if `f` is less than 0.



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The goal is to check if we can make the amount of water in all containers the same by pouring water from one container to another. The key observation here is that if the total amount of water is divisible by the number of containers, we can always achieve this by distributing the water evenly.

2. **Given Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads input from standard input (file `0`).
   - It processes each test case by reading the number of containers (`n`) and the amounts of water in each container (`a`).
   - It calculates the target amount of water per container, `u`, which is the average of the amounts.
   - It initializes two variables, `d` (difference from the target) and `f` (flag to track if the difference ever becomes negative).
   - For each amount of water `x` in the containers, it updates `d` by adding the difference between `x` and `u`.
   - If at any point `d` becomes negative, `f` is set to true. This means that it's impossible to redistribute the water to make all containers have the same amount because the sum of some differences is negative.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic correctly checks if it's possible to make all containers have the same amount of water.
   - Given that the sum of water is divisible by the number of containers, the only way `f` would be true is if the distribution process results in an impossible state, which the current logic correctly identifies.
   - The final output is determined by checking the value of `f` and printing "YES" if `f` is false (i.e., the operation can be performed) and "NO" otherwise.

Conclusion: The given program correctly implements the logic to determine if it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same.

Correctness: **True**
