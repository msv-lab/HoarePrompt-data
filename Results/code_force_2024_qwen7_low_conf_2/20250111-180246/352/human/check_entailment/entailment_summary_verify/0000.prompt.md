You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n containers of water lined up, numbered from left to right from 1
to n . Each container can hold any amount of water; initially, the i -th
container contains a_i units of water. The sum of a_i is divisible by n .

You can apply the following operation any (possibly zero) number of times:
pour any amount of water from the i -th container to the j -th container,
where i must be less than j (i.e. i<j ). Any index can be chosen as i or j any
number of times.

Determine whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers
the same using this operation.

Input

The first line of the input contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) —
the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of containers with water.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (0
\le a_i \le 10^9 ) — the amounts of water in the containers. It is guaranteed
that the sum of a_i in each test case does not exceed 2 \cdot 10^9 . Also, the
sum of a_i is divisible by n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases in the input does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

Output t lines, each of which is the answer to the corresponding test case. As
the answer, output "YES" if it is possible to make the amount of water in all
containers the same using the described operation. Otherwise, output "NO".

You can output each letter in any case (lowercase or uppercase). For example,
the strings "yEs", "yes", "Yes", and "YES" will be accepted as a positive
answer.

Note

In the third test case of the example (a=[4, 5, 2, 1, 3] ), you can proceed as
follows:

  * pour 1 unit of water from the first vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 5, 2, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the third, then a=[3, 4, 3, 2, 3] ; 
  * pour 1 unit of water from the second vessel to the fourth, then a=[3, 3, 3, 3, 3] .

- Program:
def func():
    for s in [*open(0)][2::2]:
        a = (*map(int, s.split()),)
        u = sum(a) // len(a)
        d = f = 0
        for x in a:
            d += x - u
            f |= d
        print('YNEOS'[f < 0::2])



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers representing the initial amounts of water in each container. For each test case, it calculates the average amount of water per container, then computes the cumulative sum of the differences between each container's water amount and the average. It also maintains a bitwise OR of these differences. After processing all test cases, the function prints 'Y' if the bitwise OR of the differences is non-negative, otherwise it prints 'N'. The function reads the number of test cases from standard input, and for each test case, it reads \( n \) and the list of water amounts.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly determines whether it is possible to make the amount of water in all containers the same using the described operations. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input from standard input and processes each test case.
2. For each test case, it calculates the average amount of water (`u`) that each container should have if the water is distributed equally.
3. It then checks if the total excess or deficit (`d`) of water can be balanced by pouring water between containers. This is done by iterating through the array `a` and updating `d` based on the difference between the current value and the average `u`. The bitwise OR operation `f |= d` ensures that if any imbalance exists, `f` will be non-zero.
4. If `f` is zero after processing all elements, it means the excess and deficit can be balanced, and the program prints "YES". Otherwise, it prints "NO".

Since the program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem and handles all the given constraints and examples, it is correct. There are no obvious edge cases or inputs that would cause the program to fail based on the problem description and the examples provided.
