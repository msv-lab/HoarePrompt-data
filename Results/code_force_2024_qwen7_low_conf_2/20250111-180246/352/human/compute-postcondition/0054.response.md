`sum1` is incremented by `arr[i]`, where `i` is calculated as `\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor`. The value of `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\) and is not affected by the code. The value of `n` is greater than 0 and is not affected by the code. The value of `i` remains the same as it is calculated once and used in the increment operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\); `n` must be greater than 0; `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\); `sum1` is incremented by `arr[i]`.**
