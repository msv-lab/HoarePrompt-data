Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4 \); `n` is a non-negative integer; `i` is \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + \frac{n}{2} \); `sum1` is the sum of the first \( \frac{n}{2} \) elements of `arr`; `sum2` is the sum of the remaining elements of `arr`; `arr[0] \leq sm3` or \( sum1 \leq sum2 \) or \( arr[n - 1] > sm3 \)**
