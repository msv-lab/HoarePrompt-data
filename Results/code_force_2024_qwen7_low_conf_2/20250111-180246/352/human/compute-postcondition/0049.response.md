The code assigns the value of the integer division of the sum of elements in `arr` by `n` to `sm3`. The previous value of `sm3` was the integer division of the sum of elements in `arr` by `n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Let's denote the sum of elements in `arr` as `S`. Therefore, `sum2` was previously defined as `S // 2`.

After the line `sm3 = sum(arr) // n`, the value of `sm3` is updated to the integer division of `S` by `n`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\), `n` is an integer input, `arr` is a list of integers, `sum1` is 0, `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\), `sum2` is the integer division of the sum of the elements in `arr` by 2, `sm3` is the integer division of the sum of elements in `arr` by `n`.**
