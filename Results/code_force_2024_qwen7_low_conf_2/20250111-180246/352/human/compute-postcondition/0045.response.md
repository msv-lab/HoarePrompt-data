Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, for each test case, `a` is a list of `n` integers, `u` is the average of the elements in `a`, `d` is the cumulative sum of the differences between each element in `a` and `u`, `f` is the bitwise OR of all values of `d` calculated in each iteration, and the output is 'Y' if `f` is not less than 0, or 'N' if `f` is less than 0.**
