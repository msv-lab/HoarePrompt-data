The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition but processes input through standard input (stdin) based on the given constraints. The function reads an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), followed by `n` integers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) where \(0 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). It is guaranteed that the sum of \(a_i\) in each test case does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^9\) and the sum of \(a_i\) is divisible by \(n\).

The function does not return any explicit value in the provided output cases. However, based on the problem description, it seems the function calculates and prints the average of the integers \(a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n\) for each test case.
