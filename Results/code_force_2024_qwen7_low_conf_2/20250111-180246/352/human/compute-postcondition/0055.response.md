Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\). This condition is not directly relevant to the loop but provides a constraint on `t`.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\).
   - `sum1` is incremented by `arr[i]`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range `range(n // 2)`. This means `i` starts from 0 up to `n // 2 - 1`.

3. **State Adjustment for the Next Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so it becomes \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1\).
   - Since the loop condition is `range(n // 2)`, the loop will continue as long as \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1 < n // 2\), which simplifies to checking if \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1 < \lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\). However, since `i` is incremented, we need to check if \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1 < n // 2\) still holds true.

Given the above, for the loop to continue executing, the condition \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1 < n // 2\) must hold. This implies that `n` must be greater than 2 (since \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1 < n // 2\) only holds for even `n > 2`).

Since the condition `n > 0` already ensures `n` is positive, and we need to ensure the loop continues, `n` must be at least 3 (since \(\lfloor \frac{3}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 2 < 2\) does not hold, but for `n = 4`, \(\lfloor \frac{4}{2} \rfloor + 1 = 2 < 2\) holds).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

- `n` must be greater than 1 (since `n > 0` and `n` must allow the loop to increment `i`).
- `i` becomes \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1\).

The updated states are:
- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` becomes \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1\).

Thus, the final state is:

**State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1\), `sum1` is incremented by `arr[i]`**.
