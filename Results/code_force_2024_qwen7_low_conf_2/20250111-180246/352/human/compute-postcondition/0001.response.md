The code `a = *map(int, s.split()),` splits the string `s` (which is the second line containing `n`) into a list of strings and converts each of them to an integer. The resulting list is assigned to the variable `a`. 

Here, `s` is the second line of the input, which contains the integer `n`. So, `a` will be a list containing the integer `n`.

The output state is: `t` is a positive integer; `a` is a list containing the integer `n` from the second line of the input.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer; `a` is a list containing the integer `n`**
