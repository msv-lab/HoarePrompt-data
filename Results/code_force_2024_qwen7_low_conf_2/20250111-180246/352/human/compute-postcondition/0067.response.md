Functionality: **The function processes multiple test cases via standard input. For each test case, it reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers `arr`. It then calculates the sum of the first half of the array (`sum1`), the sum of all elements divided by 2 (`sum2`), and the average of all elements (`sm3`). If the array has only one element or the sum of all elements is zero, it prints 'yes' and continues to the next test case. Otherwise, it checks if `sum1` is greater than `sum2`, the first element of `arr` is greater than `sm3`, and the last element of `arr` is less than or equal to `sm3`. If all these conditions are met, it prints 'yes'; otherwise, it prints 'no'. The function handles the case where `n` is 1 or the sum of `arr` is zero separately. No other variables or changes are made outside the scope of the test cases.**
