The code `sum1 += arr[i]` increments the value of `sum1` by the value of `arr[i]`. Given the initial state:

- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\)
- `n` must be greater than 1
- `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1\)
- `sum1` is incremented by `arr[i]`

After executing `sum1 += arr[i]`, the value of `sum1` changes to its previous value plus the value of `arr[i]`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1\), `sum1` is incremented by `arr[i]` and `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[i]`**
