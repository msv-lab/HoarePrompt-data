The `continue` statement causes the flow of execution to skip the rest of the current iteration of the loop and proceed directly to the next iteration. Since the `print('yes')` statement is outside of any loop in the given code snippet, it will be executed immediately without any changes to the variables. Therefore, the variables retain their original values.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\), `n` is an integer input, `arr` is a list of integers, `sum1` is 0, `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\), `sum2` is the integer division of the sum of the elements in `arr` by 2, `sm3` is the integer division of the sum of elements in `arr` by `n`, and 'yes' is printed.**
