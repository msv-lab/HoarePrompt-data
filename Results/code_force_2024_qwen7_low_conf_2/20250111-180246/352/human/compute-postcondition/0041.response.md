`d` is initially calculated as `2 * (x_next - u)`. The code snippet `d += x - u` increments `d` by the value of `x - u`. Therefore, the new value of `d` is `2 * (x_next - u) + (x - u)`. The values of `f` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d` is `2 * (x_next - u) + (x - u)`, `f` is `3 * (x_next - u)`, `a` must be an iterable collection with at least two elements**
