The code snippet simply prints 'yes'. It does not change the values of any variables or affect their states. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\), `n` is an integer input, `arr` is a list of integers, `sum1` is 0, `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\), `sum2` is the integer division of the sum of the elements in `arr` by 2, `sm3` is the integer division of the sum of elements in `arr` by `n`. After executing the print statement, 'yes' is printed.**
