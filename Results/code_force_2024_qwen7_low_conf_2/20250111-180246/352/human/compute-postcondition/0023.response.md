`d` is updated to `d + (next_x - u)`, and now `d` is incremented by `x - u`. The value of `f` includes any bits from the current value of `d`. Therefore, the value of `f` will also include any bits from `d + (next_x - u)`.

Output State: **`d` is equal to `d + (next_x - u) + (x - u)`, `f` includes any bits from `d + (next_x - u)`**
