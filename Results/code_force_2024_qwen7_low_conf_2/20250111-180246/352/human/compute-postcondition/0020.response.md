`d` is incremented by the value of `x - u`. The value of `d` is updated, but the specific value of `d` depends on its initial value and the values of `x` and `u`. The values of `a` and `u` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` must have at least one element; `d` is updated by adding `x - u` to its current value.
