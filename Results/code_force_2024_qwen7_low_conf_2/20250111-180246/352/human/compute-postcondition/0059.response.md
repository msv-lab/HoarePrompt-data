Let's analyze the loop and the provided output states step by step to determine the final state of the variables after the loop completes its execution.

### Initial State Recap:
- \( t \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4 \).
- \( n \) is an integer input.
- \( \text{arr} \) is a list of integers.
- \( \text{sum1} = 0 \).
- \( i = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \).
- \( \text{sum2} \) is the integer division of the sum of the elements in \( \text{arr} \) by 2.
- \( \text{sm3} \) is the integer division of the sum of the elements in \( \text{arr} \) by \( n \).
- "yes" is printed.

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n // 2):
    sum1 += arr[i]
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

#### Loop Execution:
- The loop iterates over the range from 0 to \( n // 2 - 1 \).
- Each iteration increments `sum1` by the value of `arr[i]`.

#### Output States:
- After 1 iteration: \( i = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor \), `sum1` is incremented by `arr[i]`.
- After 2 iterations: \( i = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + 1 \), `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[i]`.
- After 3 iterations: \( i = \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + 2 \), `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[i]`.

From these, we observe that:
- The loop continues until \( i \) reaches \( n // 2 \).

### Final State:
- Since the loop runs from \( i = 0 \) to \( i = n // 2 - 1 \), it will iterate exactly \( \frac{n}{2} \) times (assuming \( n \) is even; if \( n \) is odd, it will still iterate \( \frac{n}{2} \) times).
- Therefore, `sum1` will be the sum of the first \( \frac{n}{2} \) elements of the list `arr`.

### Output State:
- The loop will always execute if \( n > 0 \).
- `sum1` will be the sum of the first \( \frac{n}{2} \) elements of `arr`.

### Final Output State:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4 \); `n` must be a non-negative integer; `i` is \( \left\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \right\rfloor + \frac{n}{2} \) (since the loop ends just after the last iteration); `sum1` is the sum of the first \( \frac{n}{2} \) elements of `arr`.**
