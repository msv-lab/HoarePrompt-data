Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is the value of `n` input in the last iteration, `arr` is the list of integers `[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n]` from the last iteration, `sum1` is the sum of the first \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\) elements of `arr`, `sum2` is the integer division of the sum of the elements in `arr` by 2, `sm3` is the integer division of the sum of elements in `arr` by `n`. If the condition `(sum1 > sum2 and arr[0] > sm3 and arr[n - 1] <= sm3)` is true, the output is 'yes'. Otherwise, the output is 'no'.**
