Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial State:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\).
   - `n` must be greater than 1.
   - `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1\).
   - `sum1` is incremented by `arr[i]` and `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[i]`.

2. **For Loop Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(n // 2)`.
   - This means the loop will execute `n // 2` times.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Current Values:**
   - `i` is currently \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 1\).

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` will become \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 2\).

6. **State Adjustments:**
   - `t` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the loop logic.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it was not involved in the loop logic.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 to \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 2\).
   - `sum1` will be incremented by `arr[i]` again, but since we are determining the state before the increment, `sum1` remains the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 2\), `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[i]`**.
