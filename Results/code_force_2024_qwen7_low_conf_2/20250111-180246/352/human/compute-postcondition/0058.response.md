The code snippet updates `sum1` by adding the value of `arr[i]` to it. Given the initial state, `i` is defined as \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 2\). Since no changes are made to `n`, `t`, or `arr`, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the only change is to `sum1`.

To express this specifically:
- `i` is calculated as \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 2\)
- `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[i]`

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\), `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor + 2\), `sum1` is updated to `sum1 + arr[i]`**
