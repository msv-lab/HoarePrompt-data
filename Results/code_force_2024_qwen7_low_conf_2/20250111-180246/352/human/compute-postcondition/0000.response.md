To ensure the loop can execute, we need to carefully analyze the given setup and the loop structure.

1. **Understanding the Setup**:
   - `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases.
   - Each test case consists of:
     - `n`: The number of containers.
     - A list of `n` integers (`a_1, a_2, ..., a_n`), representing the initial amounts of water in each container.
   - It is guaranteed that the sum of `a_i` for each test case is divisible by `n`.
   - The sum of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

2. **Loop Structure**:
   - The loop iterates over lines read from standard input using `[*open(0)][2::2]`.
   - `[*open(0)]` reads all lines from standard input and converts them into a list.
   - `[2::2]` skips every other line starting from the third line (index 2).

3. **Analyzing the Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to execute, there must be enough lines in the input to satisfy the condition `[2::2]`.
   - Since each test case consists of `n + 1` lines (1 line for `n` and `n` lines for the list of integers), and we skip every other line starting from the third, we need at least 3 lines in the input to satisfy the condition.

4. **Required States**:
   - We need to ensure that there are at least 3 lines in the input for the loop to execute.
   - The first line should contain the value of `t`, the second line should contain the value of `n`, and the third line onwards should contain the list of integers for the first test case.

Given this analysis, the required states to adjust for the loop to execute are:

- `t` must be a positive integer.
- There must be at least 3 lines in the input, with the first line containing `t`, the second line containing `n`, and the third line onwards containing the list of integers for the first test case.

State: **`t` is a positive integer, there must be at least 3 lines in the input, the first line contains `t`, the second line contains `n`, and the third line onwards contains the list of integers for the first test case**
