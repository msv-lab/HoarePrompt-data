The code `sum2 = sum(arr) // 2` calculates the integer division of the sum of elements in `arr` by 2 and assigns the result to `sum2`. The other variables (`t`, `n`, `arr`, `sum1`, `i`, `sm3`) are not affected by this operation.

- `sum2` is updated to the integer division of the sum of elements in `arr` by 2.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t - 1 < 10^4\), `n` is an integer input, `arr` is a list of integers (based on user input), `sum1` is 0, `i` is \(\lfloor \frac{n}{2} \rfloor\), `sum2` is the integer division of the sum of the elements in `arr` by 2, `sm3` is the integer division of the sum of elements in `arr` by `n`, and the value of `sum2` is calculated as described.**
