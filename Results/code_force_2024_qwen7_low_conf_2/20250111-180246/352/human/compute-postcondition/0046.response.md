The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in the provided code snippet. Instead, it implies that the function will read input from an external source, such as standard input or an input file, which includes the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` sets of input, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the initial amounts of water in each container. The function processes this input and provides an output based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts no explicit parameters but reads the number of test cases `t`, followed by `t` sets of input, each containing an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers representing the initial amounts of water in each container, and returns an output based on the given constraints.**
