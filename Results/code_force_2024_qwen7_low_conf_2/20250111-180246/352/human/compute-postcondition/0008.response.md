`d` is initially set to `a[1] - u`, and `f` is also set to `a[1] - u`. The code `d += x - u` means that `d` is incremented by the value of `x - u`. The value of `x` and `u` are not specified, but since `d` and `f` are initially the same, the updated value of `d` will be `a[1] - u + x - u`, which simplifies to `a[1] - 2 * u + x`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer, `a` is a list containing at least two elements, `u` is the second element in the list `a`, `d` is `a[1] - 2 * u + x`, `f` is `a[1] - u`**
