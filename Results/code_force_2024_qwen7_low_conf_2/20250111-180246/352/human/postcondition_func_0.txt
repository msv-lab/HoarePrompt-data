The function processes multiple test cases, each consisting of an integer \( n \) and a list of \( n \) integers representing the initial amounts of water in each container. For each test case, it calculates the average amount of water per container, then computes the cumulative sum of the differences between each container's water amount and the average. It also maintains a bitwise OR of these differences. After processing all test cases, the function prints 'Y' if the bitwise OR of the differences is non-negative, otherwise it prints 'N'. The function reads the number of test cases from standard input, and for each test case, it reads \( n \) and the list of water amounts.
