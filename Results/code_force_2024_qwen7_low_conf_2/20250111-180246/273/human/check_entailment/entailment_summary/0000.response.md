Reasoning:
1. The problem requires finding a configuration of \( n \) houses on an \( n \times n \) grid such that each house is placed in a unique column and each wizard can visit another house at a specific Manhattan distance.
2. The program attempts to solve this by:
   - Reading the number of houses \( n \) and the distances \( a \).
   - Initially placing each house at the same position \((i+1, i+1)\) for simplicity.
   - Iterating over each wizard and trying to find a house that is at the required Manhattan distance from the current wizard's house.
   - If such a house is found, it records the index of the visiting wizard.
   - If no suitable house is found for any wizard, it prints "NO" and returns.
   - If all wizards can find a suitable house, it prints "YES" followed by the positions of the houses and the visiting wizards' indices.

3. The logic in the program:
   - Placing all houses initially at the same position simplifies the initial state but does not guarantee a solution.
   - The algorithm tries to match each wizard with another house based on the required distance, but it does not ensure that the resulting configuration meets all constraints (e.g., unique columns for houses).
   - The program assumes that if a suitable house can be found for each wizard, then the configuration is valid, which is not necessarily true without additional checks.

4. However, the program correctly handles the case where no valid configuration is found and prints "NO".
5. The program logic, while flawed, does not explicitly check for all necessary constraints (like unique columns for houses), but it still follows the basic requirement of finding a matching house for each wizard based on the given distances.

Given these points, the program does not guarantee a correct solution due to the lack of ensuring unique column constraints for houses. Therefore, the program may incorrectly report "YES" even when a valid configuration is not possible.

Correctness: **False**
