### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function correctly reads the input values `n` and `a`.
   - `n` is the number of wizards, and `a` is a list of integers indicating the required distances.

2. **Initial Positions Assignment**:
   - The function assigns each wizard an initial position `(i + 1, i + 1)` on an \(n \times n\) grid. This step ensures that initially, each wizard's house is uniquely placed in its respective column.

3. **Distance Matching**:
   - For each wizard, the function tries to find another wizard whose house is exactly `a_i` away from the current wizard's house.
   - This is done by iterating through all other wizards' positions and calculating the Manhattan distance.

4. **Check for Validity**:
   - If a valid position is found, it updates the `visit` array to record the mapping.
   - If no valid position is found for a wizard, the function prints "NO" and exits early.

5. **Output Generation**:
   - If all wizards have a valid position, the function prints "YES".
   - It then prints the positions of the houses and the mappings of wizards visiting other wizards' houses.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles the case where no valid mapping can be found, correctly printing "NO".

Given the above analysis, the function correctly implements the logic to check for the possibility of placing the houses while satisfying the given constraints. The provided code logic aligns with the problem statement and correctly handles both the feasibility check and the output generation.

### Correctness:

**True**
