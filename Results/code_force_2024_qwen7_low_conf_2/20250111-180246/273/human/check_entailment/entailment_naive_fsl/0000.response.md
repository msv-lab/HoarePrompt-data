Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the houses need to be placed such that no two houses share the same column. Specifically, the program always assigns houses in a diagonal manner (i.e., positions like (1, 1), (2, 2), etc.), which may not satisfy the condition that the distance from each wizard's house to another wizard's house is exactly \(a_i\).

For example, consider the input:
```
4
1 1 1 1
```
In this case, the program will assign the houses as follows:
```
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```
However, this assignment does not satisfy the requirement that each wizard needs to visit a house that is exactly 1 unit away from their own house. For instance, the first wizard cannot visit the house at (2, 2) because the distance is 1 but the second wizard's house is at (2, 2). Thus, the program does not correctly handle this scenario, making it incorrect.
