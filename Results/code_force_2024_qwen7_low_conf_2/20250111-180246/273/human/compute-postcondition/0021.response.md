Postcondition: ***`i` and `j` are integers, and `i` is not equal to `j`. `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`. If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visit[i]` is set to `j + 1` and `found` is set to `True`. Otherwise, the values of `visit[i]` and `found` remain unchanged.***
