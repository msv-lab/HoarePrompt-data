Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that `0 <= j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[i]` is `-1` and `found` is `False`.***

Explanation: Since the if condition `(not found)` evaluates to `True`, it means that no valid `j` was found such that `dist == a[i]` for any `i` where `i` is less than 0. Therefore, the values of `visit[i]` remain `-1` and `found` remains `False`. All other conditions from the precondition are retained.
