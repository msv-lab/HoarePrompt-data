Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between positions[i] and positions[j]; if `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visit[i]` is set to `j + 1` and `found` is set to `True`. Otherwise, the values of `visit[i]` and `found` remain unchanged.***
