Postcondition: **`i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j < n\), `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[i]` is either `-1` (if no valid `j` is found such that `i != j` and `dist` equals `a[i]`) or `j + 1` (if a valid `j` is found such that `i != j` and `dist` equals `a[i]`), and `found` is `False`**
