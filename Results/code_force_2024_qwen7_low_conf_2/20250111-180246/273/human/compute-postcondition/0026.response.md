The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a nested structure. In this case, since there is no loop or nested structure explicitly shown in the given code, the `break` statement does not affect any variable values directly. It simply breaks out of the current context, which could be an implied loop or nested structure.

Given the initial state and the fact that the `break` statement does not change any variable values, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `i` is not equal to `j + 1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a[i]` is a known value, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, `found` is `True`, `j` is `j + 1**
