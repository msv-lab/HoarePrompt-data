The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables but indicates the exit from the current loop or block of code. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `dist` is `abs(positions[0][0] - positions[n-1][0]) + abs(positions[0][1] - positions[n-1][1])`, `visit[0]` is `j + 2` if `dist == a[i]` and `-1` otherwise, `found` is `True`, `visit[i]` is `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or block of code.**
