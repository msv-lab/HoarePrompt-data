The code appends a new tuple \((i + 1, i + 1)\) to the list `positions`. Given that `i` is initially 3, the new tuple added is \((4, 4)\). This does not affect the values of `n`, `a`, or `i`.

Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\)
- `positions` is now \([ (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4) ]\)
- `i` is 3

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\); `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\); `positions` is \([ (1, 1), (2, 2), (4, 4) ]\); `i` is 3**
