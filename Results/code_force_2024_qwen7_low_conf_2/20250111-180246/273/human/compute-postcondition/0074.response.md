Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is an integer such that `1 <= j < n` and the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]` matches `a[0]`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[0]` is either `-1` (if no valid `j` is found) or `j + 1` (if a valid `j` is found), `found` is `False`, and `i` is not equal to `j`***
