To determine the output state of the given loop after all iterations, let's analyze the loop step by step and consider the conditions under which the loop will terminate.

### Initial State:
- `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
- `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\)
- `positions` is a list containing \([(i+1, i+1) \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(n)]\)
- `i` is \(n-1\)
- `visit` is a list of length `n` where each element is `-1`

### Loop Code:
```python
for i in range(n):
    found = False
    for j in range(n):
        if i != j:
            dist = abs(positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]) + abs(positions[i][1] - positions[j][1])
            if dist == a[i]:
                visit[i] = j + 1
                found = True
                break
    if not found:
        print('NO')
        return
```

### Analysis:
1. **Outer Loop**: The outer loop iterates over each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`.
2. **Inner Loop**: For each `i`, the inner loop iterates over each index `j` from `0` to `n-1` (excluding `i` itself).
3. **Distance Calculation**: For each pair `(i, j)`, the Manhattan distance `dist` between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]` is calculated.
4. **Condition Check**: If `dist` equals `a[i]`, then `visit[i]` is set to `j + 1`, and the `found` flag is set to `True`. The inner loop breaks immediately.
5. **Termination Condition**: If `found` remains `False` after the inner loop completes, the function prints `'NO'` and returns.

### Output State After All Iterations:
- **If the loop completes successfully without printing 'NO':**
  - For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, there exists a `j` such that `dist` equals `a[i]` and `visit[i]` is set to `j + 1`.
  - This means that each `i` has a corresponding `j` such that the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]` matches `a[i]`.

- **If the loop does not complete successfully (i.e., it prints 'NO'):**
  - There exists at least one `i` for which no valid `j` can be found such that `dist` equals `a[i]`.

### Final Output State:
**Output State:**
- If the loop completes successfully without printing 'NO':
  - For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `visit[i]` is an integer such that `1 <= visit[i] <= n` and the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[visit[i] - 1]` equals `a[i]`.
- If the loop does not complete successfully:
  - The function prints `'NO'` and the values of `i`, `j`, `dist`, `visit`, and `found` remain undefined or invalid according to the conditions mentioned above.

Thus, the final output state is:
**Output State: **For each `i` from `0` to `n-1`, `visit[i]` is an integer such that `1 <= visit[i] <= n` and the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[visit[i] - 1]` equals `a[i]`, or the function prints `'NO'`.
