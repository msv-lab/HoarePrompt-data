Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables and Their Initial States:**
   - `n`: An integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `a`: A list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
   - `positions`: An empty list.

2. **Understand the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `range(n)`, meaning `i` will take values from 0 to `n-1`.

3. **Determine What Needs to Be Adjusted:**
   - For the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be a positive integer, which is already given as \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\). This condition is satisfied.
   - The loop will iterate over the range `range(n)`, so `i` will start at 0 and go up to `n-1`. We need to specify the initial value of `i`.

4. **Combine the States:**
   - `n` is an integer within the specified range.
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers, each satisfying \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\).
   - `positions` is an empty list.
   - `i` must start at 0 for the loop to begin executing.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `positions` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
