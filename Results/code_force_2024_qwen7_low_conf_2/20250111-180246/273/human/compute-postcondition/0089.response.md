According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the state is given as follows:

- `i` is 0
- `j` is an integer such that `1 <= j < n`
- `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j + 1]`
- `visit[0]` is `j + 2` if `dist == a[i]` and `-1` otherwise
- `found` remains `True` if `dist == a[i]` and `False` otherwise

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must satisfy the condition `1 <= j < n`. Since `j` must be incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, at the end of the last iteration, `j` was one less than its maximum allowed value (which is `n-1`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be `n-1`.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j + 1]`, `visit[0]` is `j + 2` if `dist == a[i]` and `-1` otherwise, `found` remains `True` if `dist == a[i]` and `False` otherwise**
