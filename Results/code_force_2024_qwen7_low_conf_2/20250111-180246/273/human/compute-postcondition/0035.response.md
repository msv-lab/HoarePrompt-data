Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `i` is not equal to `j + 2`, `dist` is |`positions[i][0]` - `positions[j][0]`| + |`positions[i][1]` - `positions[j][1]`|, `visit[i]` is `j + 2` if `dist == a[i]` and `found` is `True` otherwise, `visit[i]` is unchanged if `dist != a[i]` and `found` is unchanged, `j` is `j + 1`***
