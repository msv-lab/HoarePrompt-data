The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; instead, it breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or match-case statement. Since there is no loop or match-case statement in the given code, the only effect is that the program will exit the current context, but the variables' values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j < n\), `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j+1]`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, `found` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
