The given code `print(' '.join(map(str, visit)))` does not affect any of the variables in the initial state. It prints the elements of the `visit` list, which is not defined in the initial state. Since `visit` is not mentioned in the initial state, and there are no assignments or changes to any existing variables, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total'` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0, `positions` is an empty list, no print statements have been executed.**
