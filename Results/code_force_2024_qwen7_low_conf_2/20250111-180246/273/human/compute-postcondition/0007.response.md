Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\)
   - `positions` is a list containing `[ (1, 1), (2, 2) ]`
   - `i` is 2

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs from `i` to `n-1` because `i` starts at 2 and the loop will continue as long as `i < n`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was 2.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.
   - The loop condition requires `i < n` to be true, so `i` must be less than `n`.

5. **Adjusted States**:
   - `n` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `a` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `positions` remains the same as it does not change within the loop.
   - `i` is incremented to 3.
   - `i` must still satisfy the loop condition `i < n`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

**State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `positions` is a list containing `[ (1, 1), (2, 2) ]`, `i` is 3**
