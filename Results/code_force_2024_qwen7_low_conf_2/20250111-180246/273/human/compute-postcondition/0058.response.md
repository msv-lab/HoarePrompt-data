Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j + 1 < n\), `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j+1]`, `visit[i]` is either `-1` (if `i != j + 1` does not hold or `dist` does not equal `a[i]`) or \(j + 2\) (if `i != j + 1` holds and `dist` equals `a[i]`), and `found` is `True` if `dist` equals `a[i]` and `i \neq j + 1`; otherwise, `found` remains `False`.***
