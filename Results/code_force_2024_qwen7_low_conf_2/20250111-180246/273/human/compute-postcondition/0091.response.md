`visit[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. Given that `j` is `n-1`, the value of `visit[i]` becomes `(n-1) + 1`, which simplifies to `n`.

The other variables (`i`, `j`, `dist`, `visit[0]`, `found`) are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is `n-1`, `dist` is `abs(positions[0][0] - positions[n-1][0]) + abs(positions[0][1] - positions[n-1][1])`, `visit[0]` is `j + 2` if `dist == a[i]` and `-1` otherwise, `found` remains `True` if `dist == a[i]` and `False` otherwise, `visit[i]` is `n`**
