The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, i + 1)` to the `positions` list. Given the initial state where `i` is 0, the tuple appended will be `(0 + 1, 0 + 1)`, which simplifies to `(1, 1)`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `a`, and `positions`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `positions` is a list containing `[ (1, 1) ]`, `i` is 0**
