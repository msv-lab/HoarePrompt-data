Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is an integer such that `1 <= j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[0]` is `j + 1` if `dist == a[i]` and `-1` otherwise, `found` is `True` if `dist == a[i]` and remains `False` otherwise. Since the `else` part is not present, the postcondition directly follows from the `if` part.***
