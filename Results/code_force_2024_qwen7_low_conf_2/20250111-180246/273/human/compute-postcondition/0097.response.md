Postcondition: ***`i` is 0, `j` is an integer such that `1 <= j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[0]` is `-1` because `dist != a[i]` for any `j`, `found` is `False` because no `j` satisfies `dist == a[i]`, and the value of `found` remains `False`.***
