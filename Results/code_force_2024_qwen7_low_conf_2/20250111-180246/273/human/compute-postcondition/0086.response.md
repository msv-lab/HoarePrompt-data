The code `break` does not change the values of any variables; it only breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since no loop or switch statement is present in the given code snippet, the variables remain unchanged after executing the `break` statement.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is an integer such that `1 <= j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j + 1]`, `visit[0]` is `j + 1`, `found` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
