The variable `found` is set to `False`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j < n\), `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[0]` is either `-1` (if no valid `j` is found such that `i != j` and `dist` equals `a[i]`) or `j + 1` (if a valid `j` is found such that `i != j` and `dist` equals `a[i]`), and `found` is `False`.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j < n\), `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[0]` is either `-1` (if no valid `j` is found such that `i != j` and `dist` equals `a[i]`) or `j + 1` (if a valid `j` is found such that `i != j` and `dist` equals `a[i]`), and `found` is `False`**
