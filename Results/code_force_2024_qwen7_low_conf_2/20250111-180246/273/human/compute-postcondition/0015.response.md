The code calculates the Manhattan distance between two points in a 2D space using the indices `i` and `j`. The Manhattan distance is given by the formula: \( \text{dist} = |positions[i][0] - positions[j][0]| + |positions[i][1] - positions[j][1]| \).

Since the initial state only mentions `i` and `j` but does not specify their exact values or the values of `positions`, let's denote the coordinates of `positions[i]` as `(xi, yi)` and the coordinates of `positions[j]` as `(xj, yj)`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, but `dist` is now set to the calculated Manhattan distance.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between positions[i] and positions[j]**
