The code `print('NO')` prints the string 'NO' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `i`, `j`, `dist`, `visit[i]`, or `found`. Therefore, the values of these variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that `0 <= j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[i]` is `-1` and `found` is `False`. The string 'NO' was printed to the console.**
