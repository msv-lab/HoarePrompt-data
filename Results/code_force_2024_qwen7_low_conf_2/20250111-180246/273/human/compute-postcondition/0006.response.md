The code appends a new tuple `(i + 1, i + 1)` to the list `positions`. Given that the initial value of `i` is 1, the tuple added to `positions` will be `(2, 2)`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state is as follows:

- `n` remains an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\).
- `positions` now includes the tuples `[ (1, 1), (2, 2) ]`.
- `i` is now 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `positions` is a list containing `[ (1, 1), (2, 2) ]`, `i` is 2**
