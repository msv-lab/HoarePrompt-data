The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts them to a list of integers. This means that `a` is now a list of integers, and `n` remains unchanged as the length of this new list.

Let's denote the input as `s`, where `s` is a string containing `n` space-separated integers. After executing the code, `a` will be a list of these integers, and `n` will remain the length of this list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n, and the values in `a` are the integers read from input.**
