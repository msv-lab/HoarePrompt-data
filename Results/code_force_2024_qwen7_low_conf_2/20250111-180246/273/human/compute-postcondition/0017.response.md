The code `visit[i] = j + 1` assigns the value of `j + 1` to `visit[i]`. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged, and the value of `dist` remains the same, which is equal to `a[i]`. The output state includes the updated value of `visit[i]` as `j + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, and `i` is not equal to `j`; `dist` is the Manhattan distance between positions[i] and positions[j], the value of `dist` is equal to `a[i]`; `visit[i]` is `j + 1`.**
