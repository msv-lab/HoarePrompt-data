`visit[i]` is assigned the value `j + 1`. According to the initial state, `i` is 0, and `j` is an integer such that `1 <= j < n`. The value of `j + 1` will be assigned to `visit[0]`, which means `visit[0]` is updated to `j + 1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `j` is an integer such that `1 <= j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j + 1]`, `visit[0]` is `j + 1`, `found` is `True` if `dist == a[i]` and remains `False` otherwise.**
