`found` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j + 1 < n\), `dist` remains unchanged as it is calculated from the positions of `i` and `j`, `visit[i]` is now \(j + 1\), and `found` is explicitly set to `True`.

Output State: **`i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j + 1 < n\), `dist` is \(\left| \text{positions[i][0]} - \text{positions[j][0]} \right| + \left| \text{positions[i][1]} - \text{positions[j][1]} \right|\), `visit[i]` is now \(j + 1\), and `found` is `True`.**
