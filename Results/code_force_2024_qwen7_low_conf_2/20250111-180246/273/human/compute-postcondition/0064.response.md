Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j < n\), `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j+1]`, `visit[i]` is either \(-1\) (if \( i \neq j \) does not hold or \( \text{dist} \) does not equal \( a[i] \)) or \( j + 1 \) (if \( i \neq j \) holds and \( \text{dist} \) equals \( a[i] \)), and `found` is `True` if \( \text{dist} \) equals \( a[i] \) and \( i \neq j \); otherwise, `found` remains `False`. If `dist` equals \( a[i] \) and \( i \neq j \), the function breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
