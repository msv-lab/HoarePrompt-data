The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or conditional block. In this case, since there is no loop or conditional block, the only effect is that the program will exit the current context (if it was inside one). However, since no loop or conditional block is present in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`found` is `True`, `i` is 0, `j` is an integer such that `1 <= j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[0]` is `j + 1`, and `i` is not equal to `j`.**
