The code `print(pos[0], pos[1])` attempts to print the first and second elements of the `pos` list. However, there is no variable named `pos` defined in the given initial state. Therefore, the code will raise a NameError because `pos` is not defined. Since the code does not change any of the existing variables and results in an error, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total'` is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0, `positions` is a non-empty list**
