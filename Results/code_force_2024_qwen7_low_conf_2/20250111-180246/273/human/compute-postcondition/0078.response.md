`found` is assigned the value `True`. The value of `i` remains 0, `j` remains an integer such that `1 <= j < n`, `dist` remains the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[0]` remains `j + 1`, and `i` is not equal to `j`. 

Output State: **`found` is `True`, `i` is 0, `j` is an integer such that `1 <= j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[0]` is `j + 1`, and `i` is not equal to `j`.**
