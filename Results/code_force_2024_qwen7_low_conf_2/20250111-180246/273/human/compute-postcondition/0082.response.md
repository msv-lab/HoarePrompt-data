According to the given code and the initial state, we need to determine how the states change as the loop progresses.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` is 0
   - `j` is an integer such that `1 <= j < n`
   - `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]`
   - `visit[0]` is `j + 1` if `dist == a[i]` and `-1` otherwise
   - `found` is `True` if `dist == a[i]` and remains `False` otherwise

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` was one of the values in the range `[1, n-1]`.
   - `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]`.
   - `visit[0]` is either `j + 1` or `-1` depending on whether `dist == a[i]`.
   - `found` is `True` if `dist == a[i]` and `False` otherwise.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, meaning it will now be `j + 1`.
   - `dist` will be recalculated as the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j+1]`.
   - `visit[0]` will be updated based on whether `dist == a[i]` for the new `j`.
   - `found` will remain the same unless `dist == a[i]` changes.

Given that the loop will execute again if `j` is still within the range `[1, n-1]`, we need to adjust the state such that `j` is in the next valid position.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` is now `j + 1`.
- `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j]`.
- `visit[0]` is `j + 1` if `dist == a[i]` and `-1` otherwise.
- `found` remains `True` if `dist == a[i]` and `False` otherwise.

State: **`i` is 0, `j` is an integer such that `1 <= j < n`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[0]` and `positions[j + 1]`, `visit[0]` is `j + 2` if `dist == a[i]` and `-1` otherwise, `found` is `True` if `dist == a[i]` and remains `False` otherwise.
