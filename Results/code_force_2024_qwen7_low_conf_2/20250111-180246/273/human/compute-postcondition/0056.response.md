The code `break` does not change the values of any variables but indicates the exit from the nearest loop or conditional statement. Given the initial state, the only thing that changes is that we break out of the loop or conditional statement we were inside. The values of the variables remain the same.

Output State: **`i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j + 1 < n\), `dist` is \(\left| \text{positions[i][0]} - \text{positions[j][0]} \right| + \left| \text{positions[i][1]} - \text{positions[j][1]} \right|\), `visit[i]` is now \(j + 1\), and `found` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
