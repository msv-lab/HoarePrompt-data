Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `a` is a list of `n` integers where \(0 \leq a_i \leq n\) for each \(1 \leq i \leq n\), `positions` is a list containing \([(i+1, i+1) \text{ for } i \text{ in range}(n)]\), `i` is \(n-1\)**

### Explanation:
1. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over the range from 0 to \(n-1\). Each iteration appends a tuple \((i+1, i+1)\) to the `positions` list.
2. **Final Iteration**: After the loop completes, `i` will be \(n-1\).
3. **Positions List**: Since the loop appends \((i+1, i+1)\) for each \(i\) in the range from 0 to \(n-1\), the `positions` list will contain \([(1, 1), (2, 2), ..., (n, n)]\).

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the `positions` list will contain tuples where both elements in each tuple are the same, ranging from 1 to \(n\).
