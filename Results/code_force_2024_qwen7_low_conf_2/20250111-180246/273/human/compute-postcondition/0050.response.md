Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j < n\), `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, `found` is `True`, and `i` is not equal to `j`. This occurs if and only if `dist` equals `a[i]`. Otherwise, the original state of `found` remains as `False`.***
