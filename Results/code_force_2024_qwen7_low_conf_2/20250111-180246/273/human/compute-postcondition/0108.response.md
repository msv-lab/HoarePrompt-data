The given code `print(pos[0], pos[1])` does not assign any new values to the variables `pos[0]` or `pos[1]`. Instead, it prints the values of `pos[0]` and `pos[1]`. Since no new assignments are made, the values of `pos[0]` and `pos[1]` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`pos[0]` retains its initial value, `pos[1]` retains its initial value**
