Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where each element `a_i` represents the Manhattan distance between two points in a grid. It attempts to find a permutation of indices such that the Manhattan distance between the points corresponding to consecutive indices in the permutation matches the values in `a`. If such a permutation exists, the function prints "YES" followed by the positions of the points, and the visited indices (which indicate the mapping). If no valid permutation can be found, the function prints "NO". The function does not return any value.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input values are within specified bounds (2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5 and 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n). However, it does not explicitly handle cases where the input does not meet these constraints.
- The function does not validate the input types; it should check if `n` is an integer and if `a` is a list of integers.
- The function uses a global variable `positions` which is not initialized before being used in the first for loop. This could lead to undefined behavior if the function is called multiple times without proper handling.
- The function does not handle the case where the input is invalid (e.g., non-integer input for `n` or invalid elements in `a`). Proper error handling should be included to manage such scenarios.
