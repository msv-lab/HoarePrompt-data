Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j < n\), `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `visit[i]` is either `-1` (if `i != j` does not hold or `dist` does not equal `a[i]`) or `j + 1` (if `i != j` holds and `dist` equals `a[i]`), and `found` is `True` if `dist` equals `a[i]` and `i != j`; otherwise, `found` remains `False`.***
