Postcondition: ***`i` is an integer, `i` is not equal to `j + 1`, `dist` is the Manhattan distance between `positions[i]` and `positions[j]`, `a[i]` is a known value, `visit[i]` is `j + 1`, `found` is `True`, `j` is `j + 1` if `dist == a[i]`. Otherwise, `visit[i]` and `found` remain unchanged from the previous iteration, `j` is `j + 1`.*
