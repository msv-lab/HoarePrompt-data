`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` remains unchanged because no assignment or operation affecting `a` is performed. The precondition that `2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5` is still valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5, `a` is a list of n integers where 0 ≤ a_i ≤ n for each 1 ≤ i ≤ n**
