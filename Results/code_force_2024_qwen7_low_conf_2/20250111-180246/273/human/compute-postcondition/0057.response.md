Postcondition: ***`i` is less than 0, `j` is an integer such that \(0 \leq j + 1 < n\), `dist` is \(\left| \text{positions[i][0]} - \text{positions[j][0]} \right| + \left| \text{positions[i][1]} - \text{positions[j][1]} \right|\). If `dist` equals `a[i]` and `i \neq j + 1`, `visit[i]` is set to \(j + 1\) and `found` is set to `True`, otherwise `visit[i]` and `found` retain their previous values.***
