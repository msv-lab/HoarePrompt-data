The function processes a list of integers `a` of length `n`, where each element `a_i` represents the Manhattan distance between two points in a grid. It attempts to find a permutation of indices such that the Manhattan distance between the points corresponding to consecutive indices in the permutation matches the values in `a`. If such a permutation exists, the function prints "YES" followed by the positions of the points, and the visited indices (which indicate the mapping). If no valid permutation can be found, the function prints "NO". The function does not return any value.
