You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program: 
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if n <= x // i:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if n <= i:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, and for each test case, x is an integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 10^8 and n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ x.
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        x, n = map(int, input().split())
        
        ans = 1
        
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if n <= x // i:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if n <= i:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        
        print(ans)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the last positive integer input, `n` is the last integer input such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), and `ans` is the maximum value between any `i` such that `x % i == 0` and `n <= x // i` or any `x // i` such that `n <= i`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers \(t\), \(x\), and \(n\) where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), and \(1 \leq n \leq x\). For each test case, it finds and prints the maximum integer \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{x}\)) such that \(x\) is divisible by \(i\) and \(n \leq i\), or the maximum integer \(j = x // i\) such that \(n \leq j\) and \(x\) is divisible by \(j\). If \(t\) is out of the valid range, the function prints an error message.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem statement and the expected output.

1. **Problem Statement Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) that can be achieved by dividing the total difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. The GCD should be maximized.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the maximum GCD can often be found by checking divisors of `x` that can be used to split `x` into exactly `n` parts. If no such divisor exists, then the best we can do is to use 1 as the GCD (since any number divided by itself results in 1).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD value.
   - It iterates over possible divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`.
     - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks if `n` can be accommodated within the number of parts derived from `x // i`.
     - It updates `ans` to the maximum GCD found.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of checking divisors up to the square root of `x` and ensuring `n` parts is sound.
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the maximum GCD is 1 when no better GCD can be found.
   - The program iterates through all possible ways to divide `x` into `n` parts efficiently using the divisor approach.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be logically correct and follows the necessary steps to find the maximum GCD.

Correctness: **True**
