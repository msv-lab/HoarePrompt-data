Reasoning:

To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze its logic in relation to the problem statement and the expected output.

1. **Problem Statement Understanding**: The problem requires finding the maximum GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) that can be achieved by dividing the total difficulty `x` into `n` sub-problems. The GCD should be maximized.

2. **Key Insight**: The key insight here is that the maximum GCD can often be found by checking divisors of `x` that can be used to split `x` into exactly `n` parts. If no such divisor exists, then the best we can do is to use 1 as the GCD (since any number divided by itself results in 1).

3. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program reads the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `x` and `n`.
   - It initializes `ans` to 1, which is the minimum possible GCD value.
   - It iterates over possible divisors `i` from 1 to the square root of `x`.
     - If `x` is divisible by `i`, it checks if `n` can be accommodated within the number of parts derived from `x // i`.
     - It updates `ans` to the maximum GCD found.
   - Finally, it prints the maximum GCD found for each test case.

4. **Correctness Check**:
   - The logic of checking divisors up to the square root of `x` and ensuring `n` parts is sound.
   - The program correctly handles the edge cases where the maximum GCD is 1 when no better GCD can be found.
   - The program iterates through all possible ways to divide `x` into `n` parts efficiently using the divisor approach.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be logically correct and follows the necessary steps to find the maximum GCD.

Correctness: **True**
