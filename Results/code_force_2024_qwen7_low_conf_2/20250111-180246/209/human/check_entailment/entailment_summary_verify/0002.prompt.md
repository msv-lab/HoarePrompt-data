You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
import math

t = int(input())
for _ in range(t):
    (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = func_1(x, n)
    print(ans)

def func_1(x, n):
    xl = []
    ans = 0
    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x) + 1)):
        if x % i == 0 and i not in xl:
            xl.append(i)
            if x // i > 2 and x // i not in xl:
                xl.append(x // i)
    l = sorted(xl)
    for ll in reversed(l):
        if ans == 0:
            if x // ll >= n and ll > ans:
                ans = ll
        else:
            break
    return ans



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `n`. `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), and `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).

The function first finds all divisors of `x` that are greater than 1 and less than or equal to \(\sqrt{x}\), storing them in a list `xl`. It then sorts this list and iterates over it in reverse order to find the largest divisor `ll` such that `x // ll \geq n`. If such a divisor is found, it updates `ans` to `ll`; otherwise, `ans` remains 0.

The function returns `ans`, which is either the largest divisor of `x` satisfying the condition or 0 if no such divisor exists.

Potential edge cases include when `x` is 1 (since the only divisor of 1 is 1 itself, and it would not satisfy \(x // l \geq n\) for any \(n > 1\)), and when `x` is a prime number (since it would have no divisors other than 1 and itself, and thus no divisors satisfying the condition for \(n > 1\)).

The final state of the program after the function concludes is that `ans` holds either the largest divisor of `x` that satisfies the condition or 0 if no such divisor exists.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Program**:
   - The program reads multiple test cases from standard input.
   - For each test case, it reads two integers `x` and `n`.
   - It then calls a function `func_1(x, n)` to find the maximum balance and prints the result.

2. **Function `func_1(x, n)` Analysis**:
   - This function aims to find the maximum GCD (balance) of `n` numbers whose sum equals `x`.
   - It starts by finding all divisors of `x` and stores them in a list `xl`.
   - It sorts these divisors in ascending order.
   - It iterates over the sorted divisors in reverse order to maximize the GCD value while ensuring that at least `n` sub-problems can have this GCD as their difficulty.

3. **Key Logic**:
   - The function correctly identifies all divisors of `x` and considers each divisor to be a potential GCD.
   - By sorting and iterating in reverse, it ensures that the highest possible GCD is considered first.
   - The condition `if x // ll >= n and ll > ans:` ensures that the GCD `ll` is feasible and greater than the current best solution `ans`.

4. **Verification**:
   - The logic to find the divisors and check feasibility is sound.
   - The algorithm efficiently finds the optimal solution without unnecessary computations.
   - The example provided in the problem statement matches the expected behavior of the program.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum balance for the given constraints.
