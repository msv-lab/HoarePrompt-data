You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Jay managed to create a problem of difficulty x and decided to make it the
second problem for Codeforces Round #921.

But Yash fears that this problem will make the contest highly unbalanced, and
the coordinator will reject it. So, he decided to break it up into a
problemset of n sub-problems such that the difficulties of all the sub-
problems are a positive integer and their sum is equal to x .

The coordinator, Aleksey, defines the balance of a problemset as the
[GCD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor) of the
difficulties of all sub-problems in the problemset.

Find the maximum balance that Yash can achieve if he chooses the difficulties
of the sub-problems optimally.

Input

The first line of input contains a single integer t (1\leq t\leq 10^3 )
denoting the number of test cases.

Each test case contains a single line of input containing two integers x
(1\leq x\leq 10^8 ) and n (1\leq n\leq x ).

Output

For each test case, print a single line containing a single integer denoting
the maximum balance of the problemset Yash can achieve.

Example

Input

    3
    
    10 3
    
    5 5
    
    420 69

Output

    2
    1
    6
    
Note

For the first test case, one possible way is to break up the problem of
difficulty 10 into a problemset having three problems of difficulties 4 , 2
and 4 respectively, giving a balance equal to 2 .

For the second test case, there is only one way to break up the problem of
difficulty 5 into a problemset of 5 problems with each problem having a
difficulty 1 giving a balance equal to 1 .

- Program:
def func():
    for _ in range(int(input())):
        (x, n) = map(int, input().split())
        ans = 1
        for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                if n <= x // i:
                    ans = max(ans, i)
                if n <= i:
                    ans = max(ans, x // i)
        print(ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers \(t\), \(x\), and \(n\) where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), and \(1 \leq n \leq x\). For each test case, it finds and prints the maximum integer \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{x}\)) such that \(x\) is divisible by \(i\) and \(n \leq i\), or the maximum integer \(j = x // i\) such that \(n \leq j\) and \(x\) is divisible by \(j\). If \(t\) is out of the valid range, the function prints an error message.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program attempts to find the maximum balance (GCD) of difficulties for sub-problems. The logic seems sound and covers all necessary cases:

1. It iterates through possible divisors up to the square root of `x`.
2. For each divisor `i` that divides `x`, it checks if the corresponding divisor `x // i` can form valid sub-problems.
3. It updates the maximum balance found so far.

Given the constraints and the nature of the problem, the provided solution correctly implements the logic to find the maximum GCD for the given inputs. There doesn't appear to be any edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail based on the problem description and provided examples.
