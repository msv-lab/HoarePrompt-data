Let's break down the given for loop and determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:

Given:
- `x` is an integer read from the input.
- `n` is an integer read from the input.
- `ans` is 1.
- `i` is equal to `x`.

For loop:
```python
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop starts from `1` and goes up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute, the upper bound `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be greater than `1`.

2. **Expression Analysis**:
   - The expression `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` ensures that the loop runs if there exists at least one integer `i` such that `1 <= i <= int(x ** 0.5)`.
   - This means `x` must be a positive integer, because the square root of a non-positive number is not defined in the context of integer values (we are considering only positive integers).

3. **Variables to Adjust**:
   - `x` must be a positive integer, otherwise, the loop condition will never be met.
   - The value of `i` should be adjusted to `1` as per the initial condition of the loop, not `x`.

### Conclusion:
- We need to ensure `x` is a positive integer for the loop to execute.
- We need to set `i` to `1` at the start of the loop.

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1**
