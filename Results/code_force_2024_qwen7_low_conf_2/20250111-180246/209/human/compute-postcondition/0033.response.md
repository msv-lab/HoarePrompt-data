Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1. If `n` is less than or equal to `x` divided by `i`, then `n` remains the same and the function continues execution with the updated values. Since there is no else part, the function simply continues with the condition met.***
