Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is a positive integer.
   - `n` is the same as `x`.
   - `ans` is the largest factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)`.
   - `i` is `int(x)`.
   - `ans` is printed.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for _ in range(int(input())):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of the For Loop:**
   - The loop iterates based on the input value provided by the user.
   - The loop variable `_` is used (which is common in Python when the loop variable is not needed).

4. **Determine the New State:**
   - The loop will execute once for each integer input provided by the user.
   - Since we are only concerned with the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider what happens after the loop runs once.

5. **New State After One Iteration of the Loop:**
   - After the loop runs once, the value of the input (`input()`) will be consumed.
   - Let's denote this new input value as `new_x`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:
- `x` is now `new_x`.
- `n` is the same as `new_x`.
- `ans` is not yet determined, but it will be the largest factor of `new_x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(new_x)`.
- `i` is `int(new_x)`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**`x` is a positive integer (new_x), `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is not yet determined, `i` is `int(x)`**.

To summarize the final answer in the required format:
State: **`x` is a positive integer (new_x), `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is not yet determined, `i` is `int(x)`**.
