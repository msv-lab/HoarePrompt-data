Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `x` must be at least 1.
   - `n` is equal to `b`.
   - `ans` is the maximum value between `ans` (initially 1) and `x // i` where `x % i == 0`. If no such `i` exists, `ans` remains 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - The loop has just completed an iteration with some value of `i`.
   - `x` must still be at least 1.
   - `n` is still `b`.
   - `ans` is updated based on the current value of `i` if `x % i == 0`.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` must be incremented.
   - The new value of `i` will be the current value of `i` plus 1.
   - Since the loop runs up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, we need to ensure that the new `i` is within this range.
   - If the current `i` is the last value in the range (`int(x ** 0.5) + 1`), the loop will stop.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `x` must still be at least 1.
   - `n` is still `b`.
   - `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration since the loop has not yet executed the new iteration.

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

- `x` must be at least 1.
- `n` is `b`.
- `ans` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

Since the loop runs for `i` in the range from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`, and assuming the loop has just completed its execution, the next value of `i` would be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` if it has not already reached this value.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`x` must be at least 1, `n` is `b`, `ans` remains the same, and `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` if the loop has not already reached this value.**
