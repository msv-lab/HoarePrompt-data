Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the maximum value between its current value (which is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2`) and 2. If `n` (which is `i` in this context) is less than or equal to `i`, then `ans` is updated to `x // 2` if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` remains as the maximum value between its current value and 2.***
