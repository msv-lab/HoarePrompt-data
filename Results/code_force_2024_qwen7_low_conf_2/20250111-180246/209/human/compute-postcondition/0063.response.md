Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // i`. If `x // i` <= 1, `ans` remains unchanged. If `x // i` > 1, `ans` is the maximum of the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2` and `x // 2`.***
