Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `x` is a positive integer.
- `i` is 1.
- `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // i`. If `x // i` <= 1, `ans` remains unchanged. If `x // i` > 1, `ans` is the maximum of the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2` and `x // 2`.

### For Loop:
```python
for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Initial Values**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `i` is 1.
   - `ans` is determined based on the condition provided.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - Since `i` starts from 1 and increments by 1, the next value of `i` will be 2.
   - We need to update `ans` for `i = 2` based on the same logic provided.

4. **Update `ans` for `i = 2`**:
   - The new value of `ans` will be the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2`.
   - If `x // 2` <= 1, `ans` remains unchanged.
   - If `x // 2` > 1, `ans` is the maximum of the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2` and `x // 2`.

Given that `i` is incremented to 2, we need to adjust the state accordingly:

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `x` is a positive integer (unchanged).
- `i` is now 2.
- `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2`.**
