Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, and `ans` is the maximum value between its current value (which is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2`) and 2.***

Explanation:
- The if condition `n <= x // i` checks if `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.
- If the condition is true, `ans` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value (`ans`) and 2.
- Since there is no else part, the value of `ans` remains unchanged if the condition is false.

Given the precondition that `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2`, updating `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and 2 ensures that `ans` is at least 2. Thus, the overall postcondition reflects this behavior.
