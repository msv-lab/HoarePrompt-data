The code assigns the value 1 to `ans`. The values of `x` and `n` remain unchanged from their initial state, which is that they are integers from the input and `n` is the same as `x`. The output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`x` is an integer from the input, `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is 1**
