`x` and `n` are assigned the values of the integers entered by the user using `map(int, input().split())`. This means both `x` and `n` will now hold the integer values from the input. The initial state's condition that `n` is the same as `x` is preserved, and `ans` remains unchanged as no operation was performed on it.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are integers from the input, `n` is the same as `x`, and `ans` is unchanged**
