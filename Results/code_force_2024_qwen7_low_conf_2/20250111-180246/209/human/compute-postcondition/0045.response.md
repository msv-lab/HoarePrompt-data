`i` is compared with `ans` and the maximum value between them is assigned to `ans`. Since `i` is 3 and `ans` is initially `x` (which is a positive integer), `ans` will be updated to the maximum of `x` and 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is the maximum of `x` and 3, `i` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is the maximum of `x` and 3, `i` is 3**
