Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- For each test case, `x` is an integer such that \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\).
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\).
- `ans` is initialized to 1.

### Loop Code
```python
for _ in range(int(input())):
    x, n = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, int(x ** 0.5) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            if n <= x // i:
                ans = max(ans, i)
            if n <= i:
                ans = max(ans, x // i)
    print(ans)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization and First Iteration**:
   - The outer loop runs `t` times.
   - For each iteration, `x` and `n` are read from input.
   - `ans` is initialized to 1.
   - The inner loop runs from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

2. **Inner Loop Execution**:
   - For each `i` in the range, if `x % i == 0`, it checks two conditions:
     - If `n <= x // i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `i`.
     - If `n <= i`, it updates `ans` to the maximum of `ans` and `x // i`.

3. **Final Value of `ans`**:
   - After the inner loop completes, `ans` will be the maximum value between:
     - Any `i` such that `x % i == 0` and `n <= x // i`.
     - Any `x // i` such that `n <= i`.

4. **Final State**:
   - After all `t` iterations, `ans` will contain the maximum value found during all iterations of the loop.
   - `x` and `n` will be the last values read from input.
   - `i` and other variables used within the loop will not affect the final output since they are not stored outside the loop.

### Conclusion

The loop will execute `t` times, and after all iterations, `ans` will be the maximum value found for each `x` and `n` pair. The final values of `x` and `n` will be the last inputs provided, but these do not affect the final value of `ans`.

### Output State

Output State: **`t` is the number of test cases, `x` is the last positive integer input, `n` is the last integer input such that \(1 \leq n \leq x\), and `ans` is the maximum value between any `i` such that `x % i == 0` and `n <= x // i` or any `x // i` such that `n <= i`.**
