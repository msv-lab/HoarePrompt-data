The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the user input, splits them by whitespace, and assigns them to `x` and `n` respectively. The initial state does not provide specific values for the input, so we will denote the input values as `a` and `b` (where `a` is assigned to `x` and `b` is assigned to `n`).

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. `map(int, input().split())` takes the input and splits it into parts, converting each part to an integer.
2. The first integer (`a`) is assigned to `x`.
3. The second integer (`b`) is assigned to `n`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `x` and `n`, we denote them as `a` and `b` respectively after the assignment.

Output State: **`x` is `a`, `n` is `b`**
