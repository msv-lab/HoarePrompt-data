Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `x` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `ans` is updated to `x // 2` if `x` is even, otherwise `ans` remains as the maximum value between its current value and 2.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `1` to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 2.
   - `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2`. Depending on the value of `x`, `ans` could be updated based on whether `x` is even and divisible by `2`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented to the next value in the range, which is `3` (since `i` starts from `1` and increments by `1`).

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - `i` will be `3` at the start of the next iteration.
   - `ans` remains the same unless `x` is divisible by `3` and the conditions for updating `ans` are met.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` will be `3`.
- `ans` will remain the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**

State: **`x` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, and `ans` is the maximum divisor of `x` that is less than or equal to `x // 2`.**
