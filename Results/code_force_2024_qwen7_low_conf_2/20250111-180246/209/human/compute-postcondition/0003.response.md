State before the loop starts: `x` is `a`, `n` is `b`, `ans` is 1

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop runs from `i` starting at 1 up to but not including `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
2. For the loop to start executing, `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` must be at least 1. Since `int(x ** 0.5)` is the integer part of the square root of `x`, it must be non-negative for the loop to execute. Therefore, `x` must be at least 1.

So, we need to ensure that `x` is at least 1.

3. The initial value of `i` is 1. This is already given in the loop definition and doesn't need adjustment.

4. Variables `n` and `ans` do not affect the loop condition directly.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are `x` must be at least 1.

State: **`x` must be at least 1, `n` is `b`, `ans` is 1**
