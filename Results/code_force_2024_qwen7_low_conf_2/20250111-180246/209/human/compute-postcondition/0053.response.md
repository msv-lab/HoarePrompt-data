The code `x, n = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input, splits them, and converts them to integers before assigning them to `x` and `n` respectively. The original values of `x` and `n` were the same and were positive integers. After executing the code, the new values of `x` and `n` will be the integers read from the input, but their specific values depend on the input provided.

The variable `ans` remains unchanged because no assignment to `ans` was made in the provided code. The variable `i` is updated to the value of `int(x)`, which is now the same as the new value of `x`.

Since the specific values of the input are not provided, we can express the final state in terms of the input values.

Output State: **`x` and `n` are the integers read from the input, `ans` is not yet determined, `i` is equal to `x`.**
