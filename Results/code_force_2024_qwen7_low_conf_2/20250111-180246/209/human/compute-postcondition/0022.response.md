Postcondition: ***`x` must be at least 1, `n` is `b`, `ans` is the maximum of its original value and `int(x)`, and `i` is `int(x) + 1`. If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, then `ans` is updated to the maximum of its original value and `x // i`. Otherwise, the variables retain their original states.***
