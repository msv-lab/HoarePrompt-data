Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is `b`, `ans` is the maximum value between the original `ans` (which is 1) and any `x // i` where `i` is a divisor of `x` and `n` is less than or equal to either `i` or `x // i`. The loop executes as long as `x` is a positive integer and there exists at least one divisor `i` of `x` such that `n` is less than or equal to `i` or `x // i`.**
