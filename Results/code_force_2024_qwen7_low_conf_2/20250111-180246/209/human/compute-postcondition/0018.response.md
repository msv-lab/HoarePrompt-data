Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- \( x \) must be at least 1.
- \( n \) is \( b \).
- \( \text{ans} \) remains the same as the maximum of its original value and \( \text{int}(x) \).
- \( i \) is \( \text{int}(x) \).

### For Loop:
The for loop iterates over the range from 1 to \( \text{int}(x^{0.5}) + 1 \). The loop condition is \( i \) in this range.

### Current State After Previous Iteration:
- \( x \) must be at least 1.
- \( n \) is \( b \).
- \( \text{ans} \) remains the same as the maximum of its original value and \( \text{int}(x) \).
- \( i \) is \( \text{int}(x) \).

### Loop Execution:
At the end of the previous iteration:
- \( i \) is currently \( \text{int}(x) \).
- The loop continues if \( i \) is within the range \( 1 \) to \( \text{int}(x^{0.5}) + 1 \).

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check:
- If \( \text{int}(x) < \text{int}(x^{0.5}) + 1 \), then the loop will continue.
- If \( \text{int}(x) \geq \text{int}(x^{0.5}) + 1 \), then the loop will stop.

### Adjusted States:
- Since \( i \) starts from \( \text{int}(x) \), for the loop to continue, \( \text{int}(x) \) must be less than \( \text{int}(x^{0.5}) + 1 \).
- Therefore, \( \text{int}(x) \) must be less than \( \text{int}(x^{0.5}) + 1 \).

Given these conditions, let's summarize the new states:

### New States:
- \( x \) must be at least 1.
- \( n \) is \( b \).
- \( \text{ans} \) remains the same as the maximum of its original value and \( \text{int}(x) \).
- \( i \) is \( \text{int}(x) + 1 \) (since it needs to start from \( \text{int}(x) + 1 \) to enter the next iteration).

### Final Answer:
State: **`x` must be at least 1, `n` is `b`, `ans` remains the same as the maximum of its original value and `int(x)`, and `i` is `int(x) + 1`.**
