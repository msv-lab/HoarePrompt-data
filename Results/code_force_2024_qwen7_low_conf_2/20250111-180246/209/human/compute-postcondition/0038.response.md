According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the integer part of the square root of `x` plus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is `x`, and `i` is 1. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must be less than or equal to the integer part of the square root of `x`.

Given that `i` starts at 1 and is incremented within the loop, we need to determine the new value of `i` and check if it is still within the range required for the loop to continue.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `x` is a positive integer
- `n` is the same as `x`
- `ans` is `x`
- `i` is 1

Since `i` is 1 and the loop condition checks if `i` is less than or equal to the integer part of the square root of `x`, we need to increment `i` by 1. 

The new value of `i` will be 2. We need to check if `2` is still less than or equal to the integer part of the square root of `x`.

So, the updated states are:
- `x` is a positive integer
- `n` is the same as `x`
- `ans` remains `x` (unchanged)
- `i` is now 2

We also need to ensure that the integer part of the square root of `x` is at least 2 for the loop to continue. This means `x` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since the smallest integer whose square root is at least 2 is 4).

Therefore, the final state is:
State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is `x`, `i` is 2, and the integer part of the square root of `x` must be at least 2**
