The initial state is: `x` is a positive integer, `i` is the last value of `i` (which is `int(x)`.

The code snippet is:
```python
print(ans)
```

Let's analyze this step by step:

1. The variable `ans` is not defined in the given code snippet, and there is no prior assignment to `ans`.
2. The code simply prints `ans` without defining or modifying it.

Since `ans` is not defined, the print statement will raise a NameError. However, based on the instruction, we should focus on the state of the variables and their values.

The output state remains unchanged because no new values are assigned to any variables. The only thing affected is that the program would try to print `ans`, which is undefined.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `i` is int(x), and trying to print `ans` will raise a NameError.**
