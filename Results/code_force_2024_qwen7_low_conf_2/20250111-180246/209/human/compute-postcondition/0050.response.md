To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed, let's analyze the loop step-by-step.

### Loop Analysis

1. **Initialization**:
   - `x` is an integer from the input.
   - `n` is the same as `x`.
   - `ans` is initialized to 1.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs for each integer `i` from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Loop Body**:
   - For each `i`, check if `x` is divisible by `i` (i.e., `x % i == 0`).
   - If `n <= x // i`, update `ans` to `max(ans, i)`.
   - If `n <= i`, update `ans` to `max(ans, x // i)`.

### Observations from Example Output States

- After the loop executes 1 time (`i = 1`), `ans` becomes `x` because `x % 1 == 0` and `x // 1 == x`.
- After the loop executes 2 times (`i = 2`), `ans` is still `x` unless `x` is not divisible by 2, in which case `ans` remains unchanged.
- After the loop executes 3 times (`i = 3`), `ans` is updated based on whether `x` is divisible by 3 and whether `n` is less than or equal to 3.

### Final State Determination

The loop will continue to run as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `i` starts at 1 and increases by 1 each iteration, the loop will eventually terminate when `i` exceeds `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

#### Key Points:

1. **Value of `ans`**:
   - The loop updates `ans` whenever it finds a factor of `x` that is larger than the current value of `ans` and satisfies the condition based on `n`.
   - The final value of `ans` will be the largest factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)`.

2. **Value of `i`**:
   - The final value of `i` will be `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` if the loop terminates normally, or less if `x` has no factors up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.

3. **Values of Other Variables**:
   - `x` remains unchanged.
   - `n` remains unchanged as it is the same as `x`.

### Conclusion

After the loop has finished executing, `ans` will be the largest factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)`. The other variables `x` and `n` remain unchanged.

### Output State

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is the largest factor of `x` that is less than or equal to `sqrt(x)`, `i` is `int(x ** 0.5) + 1` if the loop executed fully or less if the loop terminated early.**
