The code `ans = max(ans, x // i)` updates the value of `ans` to be the maximum of its current value and `x // i`. Given the initial conditions, `x` is a positive integer, `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is `x`, and `i` is 2. 

If `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`, no changes are made to the variables. Here, `n` is `x`, and `x // i` is `x // 2`. Since `x` is a positive integer, `x // 2` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `x`. Thus, `n` (which is `x`) is always less than or equal to `x // 2` when `x` is even, and `n` is always less than `x // 2` when `x` is odd. In both cases, no changes are made to the variables.

Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is `x`, `i` is 2**
