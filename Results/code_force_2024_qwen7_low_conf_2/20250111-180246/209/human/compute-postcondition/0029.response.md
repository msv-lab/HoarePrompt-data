State: **`x` is an integer from the input, `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` must be a positive integer**

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Identify Variables Involved in the Loop**: The loop involves `i` (which starts from 1) and `x` (or `n`, which is the same as `x`).
2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `i` values from 1 to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
3. **Initial State**: Given `x` is an integer from the input, `n` is the same as `x`, and `ans` is 1.

For the loop to execute:
- `i` must start from 1 and go up to `int(x ** 0.5) + 1`.
- `x` must be a positive integer because the square root operation (`x ** 0.5`) is defined only for non-negative numbers, and the loop range would be invalid for `x` less than 1.

Thus, the state needs to include:
- `i` initialized to 1.
- `x` (and hence `n`) must be a positive integer.

The final state after considering these points is:
**`x` is an integer from the input, `n` is the same as `x`, `ans` is 1, `i` is 1, and `x` must be a positive integer**.
