`ans` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `x // i`. The value of `i` is `int(x) + 1`. We need to consider two cases based on whether `n` is less than or equal to `x // i`.

1. If `n <= x // i`:
   - `ans` is updated to `max(ans, x // i)`.
   - Other variables remain unchanged.

2. If `n > x // i`:
   - No changes occur to the variables.

Since the initial state does not specify a particular value for `x`, `n`, or `ans`, we need to consider the general case where `n > x // i`.

Therefore, the only change is in the value of `ans`.

Output State: **`x` must be at least 1, `n` is `b`, `ans` is the maximum of its original value and `x // (int(x) + 1)`, and `i` is `int(x) + 1`.**
