The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by three integers \(t\), \(x\), and \(n\) where \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\), \(1 \leq x \leq 10^8\), and \(1 \leq n \leq x\). For each test case, it finds and prints the maximum integer \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq \sqrt{x}\)) such that \(x\) is divisible by \(i\) and \(n \leq i\), or the maximum integer \(j = x // i\) such that \(n \leq j\) and \(x\) is divisible by \(j\). If \(t\) is out of the valid range, the function prints an error message.
