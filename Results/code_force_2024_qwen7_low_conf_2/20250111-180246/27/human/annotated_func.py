    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step-by-step and consider the final state of the variables.
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis
    #
    #1. **Initial State:**
    #   - `cards` is a list of `n` integers.
    #   - `coins` is a non-negative integer.
    #   - `n` is the length of the `cards` list.
    #   - `max_score` is 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Execution:**
    #   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
    #   - For each iteration, `num_cards = cards[i - 1]`.
    #   - If `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`, then:
    #     - `remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)`.
    #     - `remaining_cards` is a list containing all elements of `cards` except for `cards[i - 1]` and the additional `remaining_coins`.
    #     - `score` is updated to `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.
    #     - `max_score` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `score`.
    #
    #3. **Final Iterations and `max_score`:**
    #   - After the loop finishes, `max_score` will be the highest score obtained during any iteration where the conditions were met.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #After the loop has finished executing all iterations, the following conditions must hold:
    #
    #- `cards` remains unchanged as the loop only accesses and modifies the `remaining_cards` list and does not alter the original `cards` list.
    #- `coins` remains unchanged as the loop only subtracts `n - num_cards` from `coins` when the condition is met.
    #- `n` remains unchanged as the loop only iterates based on the fixed length of `cards`.
    #- `max_score` will be the highest possible score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`.
    #
    #### Output State
    #
    #**Output State:** `cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is the length of the `cards` list; `max_score` is the maximum score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`.
    return max_score
    #`max_score` is the maximum score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`. `cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is the length of the `cards` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function does not handle the case where `coins` is exactly `n - 1`. In this case, the function might need to check if buying one card is beneficial or not, depending on the value of `num_cards`.
