The code `print(out)` simply prints the value of the variable `out`. Since the value of `out` is the next element in the list `outs`, this operation does not change the value of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `outs` is a list that must contain at least two elements (excluding the first element), and the remaining elements must be valid integers according to the given formula, the value of `out` is the next element in the list `outs`.**
