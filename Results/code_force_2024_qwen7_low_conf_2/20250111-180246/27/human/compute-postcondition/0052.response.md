The code assigns the value of `i * (a[i] - min_)` to `trg`. Given that `min_` is `a[0]` and `min_idx` is 0, the expression simplifies to `trg = i * (a[i] - a[0])`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0]`, `min_idx` is 0, `i` must be between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`**
