`score` is assigned the value `num_cards * n`. The previous value of `score` was the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, but now it is directly set to `num_cards * n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 2`; `num_cards` is `cards[i - 1]`; `score` is `num_cards * n`; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)'; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)'**
