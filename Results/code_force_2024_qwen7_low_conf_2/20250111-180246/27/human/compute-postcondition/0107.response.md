According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is an integer greater than 1.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration:
1. Since the loop iterates from 1 to `n-1`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`, which means `i` will be 2.
2. The condition `n` is an integer greater than 1 remains unchanged as it is based on the initial value of `n`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly:
- `i` will be incremented to 2.
- The condition `n` is an integer greater than 1 remains the same.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 2, `k` is either `k - trg` if `k >= trg`, or 0 if `k < trg`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is updated to `a[1]` if `k >= trg` and `min_` is updated to `a[0] + k` if `k < trg`, `min_idx` is updated to 1 if `k >= trg` and remains 0 if `k < trg`, and `trg` remains `a[1] - a[0]`.**
