`min_` is incremented by `k // i`. Since `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive) and `k` is less than `trg`, the value of `k // i` is an integer division which will be a non-negative integer. The exact value depends on the specific values of `k` and `i`, but it is known that `min_` will be updated by this amount. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0] + k // i`, `min_idx` is 0, `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`**
