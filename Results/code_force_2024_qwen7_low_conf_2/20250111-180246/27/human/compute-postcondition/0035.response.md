Output State: **`max_score` is the maximum score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`. `cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is the length of the `cards` list.**
