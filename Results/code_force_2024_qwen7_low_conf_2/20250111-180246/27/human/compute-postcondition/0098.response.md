The value of `k` is decremented by `trg`. Since `k` was initially greater than or equal to `trg`, `k` will now be `k - trg`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `i` is 1
- `k` is now `k - trg`
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
- `min_` is `a[0]`
- `min_idx` is 0
- `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - trg`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0]`, `min_idx` is 0, `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`**
