Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0]`, `min_idx` is 0, `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`, and the current value of `k` is greater than or equal to `trg`***
