Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer greater than 0.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `k` is either 0 or `k - (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `min_` is either `a[0]` or updated to `a[n-1]` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and to `a[0] + k` if `k < (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`.
   - `min_idx` is either 0 or updated to `n-1` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and remains 0 if `k < (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`.
   - `trg` is either 0 or `(n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and is 0 otherwise.
   - `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   outs.append(tot)
   ```

   - This line appends the current value of `tot` to the list `outs`. No changes are made to any variables here.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The only variable that is affected is `outs`, which gets a new element appended to it.
   - The value of `tot` is retained since it is used to append to `outs`.

4. **Output State**:
   - All the preconditions remain valid.
   - `outs` now contains the value of `tot`.

**Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is either 0 or `k - (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[0]` or updated to `a[n-1]` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and to `a[0] + k` if `k < (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`, `min_idx` is either 0 or updated to `n-1` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and remains 0 if `k < (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`, `trg` is either 0 or `(n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and is 0 otherwise; `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`; `outs` is a list containing the value of `tot`.**
