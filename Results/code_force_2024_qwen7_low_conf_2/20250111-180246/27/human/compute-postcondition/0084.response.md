Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[min_idx]` where `min_idx` is the index that minimizes `a[i] + k // i` within the loop, `min_idx` is the index of the element that minimizes `a[i] + k // i` within the loop, `i` is `n - 1`, `tt` is the final value of `tt` plus the number of iterations, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the final value of `k` after all iterations, `trg` is 0, and `min_idx` is equal to `n - 1` and `k` is greater than 0***
