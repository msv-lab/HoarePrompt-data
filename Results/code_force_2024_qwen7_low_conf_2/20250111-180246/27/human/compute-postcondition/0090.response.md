Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `min_` is `min_ + k // n`.
   - `k` is `k % n`.
   - `min_idx` is `len(a) - 1`.
   - `n` is `n`.
   - `trg` is `0`.
   - `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + n - len(a) + k`.
   - `outs` is a list containing one element which is the value of `tot`.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```
   for tt in range(t):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop variable `tt` iterates from `0` to `t-1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `tt` must be less than `t`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `tt` would be `t-1`.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `tt` is `t-1` at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `tt` must be `t`.
   - All other states (`a`, `min_`, `k`, `min_idx`, `n`, `trg`, `tot`, `outs`) remain the same because the loop body is omitted and no modifications are specified for these variables within the loop.

5. **Final Adjusted States:**
   - `a` remains as a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `min_` remains as `min_ + k // n`.
   - `k` remains as `k % n`.
   - `min_idx` remains as `len(a) - 1`.
   - `n` remains as `n`.
   - `trg` remains as `0`.
   - `tot` remains as `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + n - len(a) + k`.
   - `outs` remains as a list containing one element which is the value of `tot`.

**State:**
**`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `min_ + k // n`, `k` is `k % n`, `min_idx` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is `n`, `trg` is `0`, `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + n - len(a) + k`, `outs` is a list containing one element which is the value of `tot`.**
