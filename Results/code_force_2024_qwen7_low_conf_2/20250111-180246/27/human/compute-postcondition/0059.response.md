`min_idx` is reassigned to `i - 1`. The previous value of `min_idx` was `0`. Since `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), subtracting 1 from `i` will give a new value for `min_idx` which is not 0 anymore. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0] + k // i`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`**
