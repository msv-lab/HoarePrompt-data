Postcondition: ***`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is a positive integer going up to `n`; `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]`. If `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`, `score` is updated to be the original `score` plus the return value of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` where `remaining_cards` is the list of elements in `cards` except for the element at index `i-1` and also contains `remaining_coins`, and `max_score` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `score`. If `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) < 0`, no changes are made to `score` and `max_score`. No other changes are made to the program state if `num_cards <= 0`.***
