The code creates a new list `remaining_cards` by filtering out elements from the original `cards` list where each element is not equal to the value of `i`. 

Given the initial state:
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers
- `coins` is a non-negative integer
- `n` is a positive integer
- `i` is `k + 2`
- `num_cards` is `cards[i - 1]`
- `score` is `num_cards * n`
- `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
- `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`

After executing the line:
```python
remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]
```
The variable `remaining_cards` now contains only the elements from `cards` that are not equal to `i`.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 2`; `num_cards` is `cards[i - 1]`; `score` is `num_cards * n`; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)'; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)'; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` that are not equal to `i`.**
