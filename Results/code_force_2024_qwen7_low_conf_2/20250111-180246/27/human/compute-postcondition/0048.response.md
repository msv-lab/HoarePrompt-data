The code reads a line of space-separated integers from input and converts each integer to an int, then maps this list of integers to the variable `a`. However, since no specific input values are provided, we can only describe the impact on the variables that have been changed.

The initial state includes:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `outs` is `['min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + k']`
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
- `min_` is the last element of `a`
- `min_idx` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n`
- `k` is `k % (n-1)`
- `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1
- `n` is the input integer
- `k` is the input integer

After executing the code, `a` is updated to a new list of integers based on the input. The other variables remain unchanged in terms of their types and relationships but may have different specific values based on the input.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is ['min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + k'], `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order based on input, `min_` is the last element of `a`, `min_idx` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `k` is `k % (n-1)`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer**
