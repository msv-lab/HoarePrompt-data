Given the initial state and the code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `min_idx` is the last index of the list.
   - `k` is greater than 0.
   - `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // n`.
   - `k` is updated to `k % n`.
   - `trg` remains 0.

2. **Code Snippet**:
   ```python
   tot = min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k
   ```

3. **Impact Analysis**:
   - The code calculates `tot` based on the given formula.
   - The values of `min_`, `k`, `min_idx`, `n`, and `trg` are used in the calculation.
   - The values of these variables are not changed by this line of code; they are only used in the calculation.
   - `tot` is a new variable introduced by this line, and its value depends on the current values of `min_`, `k`, `min_idx`, `n`.

4. **Calculating `tot`**:
   - Since `min_idx` is the last index of the list, we know that `min_idx = len(a) - 1`.
   - The formula for `tot` is: `tot = min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`.
   - Substituting `min_idx = len(a) - 1` into the formula: `tot = min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - (len(a) - 1)) + k`.
   - Simplifying the expression: `tot = min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + n - len(a) + k`.

5. **Output State**:
   - The variables `min_`, `k`, `min_idx`, `n`, and `trg` remain unchanged.
   - The new variable `tot` is defined and its value is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + n - len(a) + k`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `min_ + k // n`, `k` is `k % n`, `min_idx` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is `n`, `trg` is `0`, `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + n - len(a) + k`.**
