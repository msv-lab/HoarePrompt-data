The code updates the value of `min_` by adding `k // i` to it. The previous value of `min_` was either `a[i+1]` or `a[0] + k // (i+1)`. After this operation, the new value of `min_` will be:

- If the previous value of `min_` was `a[i+1]`, the new value will be `a[i+1] + k // i`.
- If the previous value of `min_` was `a[0] + k // (i+1)`, the new value will be `a[0] + k // (i+1) + k // i`.

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

**`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[i+1] + k // i` or `a[0] + k // (i+1) + k // i`, `min_idx` is either `i+1` or `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is updated according to the conditions of the if and else parts, and `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`**.
