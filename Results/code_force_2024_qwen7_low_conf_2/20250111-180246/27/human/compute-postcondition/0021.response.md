The code updates `max_score` to be the maximum of its current value and `score`. The values of other variables are not affected.

The current value of `score` is given by `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`. Therefore, `max_score` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 1`; `num_cards` is `cards[k]`; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)'; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)'; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`, plus `remaining_coins`.**
