Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[n-1]`, `min_idx` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `k` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n-1`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `outs` is an empty list.
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `k` is an input integer.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `min_` is initially set to `a[0]`.
   - `min_idx` is initially set to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `n-1`.
   - For each iteration, `trg` is calculated as `i * (a[i] - min_)`.
   - If `k >= trg`, `k` is reduced by `trg`, `min_` is updated to `a[i]`, and `min_idx` is updated to `i`.
   - If `k < trg`, `min_` is increased by `k // i`, `min_idx` is set to `i - 1`, `k` is set to `k % i`, and the loop breaks.

3. **Final Values After All Iterations:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be `n`, because the loop runs from `1` to `n-1` and increments `i` by `1` each time.
   - `k` will be the remainder when `k` is divided by `n-1` because the loop terminates by setting `k` to `k % i` when `k < trg` and `i` reaches `n-1`.

4. **Final Value of `min_`:**
   - `min_` will be `a[n-1]` because the loop continues to update `min_` until `i` reaches `n-1`.

Thus, the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop will be as described above.
