Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is either 0 or `k - (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[0]` or updated to `a[n-1]` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and to `a[0] + k` if `k < (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`, `min_idx` is either 0 or updated to `n-1` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and remains 0 if `k < (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`, and `trg` is either 0 or `(n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and is 0 otherwise.***
