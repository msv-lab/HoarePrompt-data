`trg` is assigned the value of `i * (a[i] - min_)`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, `min_` is `a[0]`, and `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. Therefore, `trg` is calculated as `1 * (a[1] - a[0])`, which simplifies to `a[1] - a[0]`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer obtained from user input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0]`, `min_idx` is 0, `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`**
