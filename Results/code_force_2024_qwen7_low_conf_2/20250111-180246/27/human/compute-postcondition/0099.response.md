`min_` is reassigned the value of `a[i]`. Given that `i` is initially 1, the value of `min_` becomes `a[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - trg`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[1]`, `min_idx` is 0, `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - trg`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[1]`, `min_idx` is 0, `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`**
