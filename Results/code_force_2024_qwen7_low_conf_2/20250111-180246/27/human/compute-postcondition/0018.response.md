The code creates a new list `remaining_cards` that contains elements from the original `cards` list except for the element equal to `i`. The variable `i` itself does not get updated, nor do any of the other variables. Therefore, the output state will include the updated `remaining_cards` list and keep the values of the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 1`; `num_cards` is `cards[k]`; `score` is `num_cards * n`; `max_score` is unchanged from the previous iteration; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)'; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`.**
