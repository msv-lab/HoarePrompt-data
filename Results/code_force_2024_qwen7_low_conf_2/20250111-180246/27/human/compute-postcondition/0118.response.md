The code `trg = i * (a[i] - min_)` does not affect the given variables `n` and `i`. It introduces new variables `trg`, `a`, and `min_`, which are not defined in the initial state. Since the values of `n` and `i` remain unchanged, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4**
