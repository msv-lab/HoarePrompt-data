Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, each consisting of an integer \( t \) representing the number of test cases, followed by \( t \) pairs of integers \( n \) and \( k \) along with a list \( a \) of \( n \) integers. For each test case, the function sorts the list \( a \) and iteratively updates the minimum value \( min_ \) and its index \( min_idx \) based on the remaining value \( k \). After processing all test cases, it calculates a value \( tot \) for each test case using the formula \( min_ + (min_ - 1) \times (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k \), and appends this value to the list `outs`. Finally, the function prints each element in `outs`. The function handles the case where \( k \) might have a remainder after the last update and adjusts accordingly.**

This summary covers all the actions performed by the code, including the potential edge case where \( k \) has a remainder after the last update, which is handled by the final adjustment of `min_` and `k`.
