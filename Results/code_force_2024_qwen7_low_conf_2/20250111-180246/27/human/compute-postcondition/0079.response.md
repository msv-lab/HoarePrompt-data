The code assigns the value of `i - 1` to `min_idx`. This means `min_idx` is now `i - 1`. The other variables (`i`, `tt`, `trg`, `min_`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, their previous values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is `tt + 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_` is `min_ + k // i`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`**
