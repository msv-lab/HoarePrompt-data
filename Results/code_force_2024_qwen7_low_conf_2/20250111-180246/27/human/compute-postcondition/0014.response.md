To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the loop statement:

### Given Conditions:
1. `cards` is a list of `n` integers.
2. `coins` is a non-negative integer.
3. `n` is a positive integer.
4. `i` is a positive integer going up to `n`.
5. `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]`.
6. If `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`, `score` is updated to be the original `score` plus the return value of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, where:
   - `remaining_cards` is the list of elements in `cards` except for the element at index `i-1`.
   - `remaining_coins` is the remaining coins after the update.
7. If `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) < 0`, no changes are made to `score` and `max_score`.
8. No other changes are made to the program state if `num_cards <= 0`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Initialization**: The loop starts with `i = 1`.
2. **End of Previous Iteration**: We need to determine the state after the previous iteration.

Let's assume that the previous iteration was when `i = k` (where `k` is some integer between 1 and `n`).

### State After Previous Iteration:
- `cards`: Unchanged from the initial state.
- `coins`: Unchanged from the initial state.
- `n`: Unchanged from the initial state.
- `i`: Increased by 1 from the previous iteration, so `i = k + 1`.
- `num_cards`: Equal to `cards[k]`.
- `score`: Updated or unchanged based on the condition.
- `max_score`: Updated or unchanged based on the condition.

### Determining the Next State:
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be within the range `[1, n]`.

Given that `i` was `k` in the previous iteration:
- If `k < n`, then `i = k + 1` is still within the range, and the loop will continue.
- If `k == n`, then `i = k + 1` would be `n + 1`, which is out of the range, and the loop will terminate.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

### Adjusted States:
- `cards`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `coins`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `n`: Remains the same as the initial state.
- `i`: Increased by 1 from the previous iteration, so `i` is `k + 1`.
- `num_cards`: Equal to `cards[k]` (since `i = k + 1`).
- `score`: May have changed based on the condition but remains the same as the state after the previous iteration.
- `max_score`: May have changed based on the condition but remains the same as the state after the previous iteration.

### Final Answer:
State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 1` (where `k` is the value of `i` in the previous iteration); `num_cards` is equal to `cards[k]`; `score` is unchanged from the previous iteration; `max_score` is unchanged from the previous iteration.**

If the previous iteration had `i = n`, then the loop terminates, and no further adjustments are needed for the state.
