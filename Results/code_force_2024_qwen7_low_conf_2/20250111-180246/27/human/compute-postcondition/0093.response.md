The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. Since the initial values of `n`, `k`, and `a` are obtained from user input, the exact values are not known, but we know that `a` is sorted. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer obtained from user input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.**
