The code `break` is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. However, since there was no loop or if statement context provided, we assume it breaks out of an implicit loop or conditional structure that was implied by the initial conditions. The value of `k` is updated to `k % i`, and the other variables (`a`, `min_`, `min_idx`, `tt`, `n`, and `trg`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0] + k // i`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is `k % i`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
