The code `k -= trg` subtracts the value of `trg` from `k`. The value of `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`. Since `i` and `a[i]` and `min_` are not explicitly defined in the initial state, we will keep them as they are. The variables `i` and `tt` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is `tt + 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `k` is `k - trg`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is `tt + 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `k` is `k - trg`**
