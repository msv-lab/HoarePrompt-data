`remaining_cards` appends the value of `remaining_coins` to itself. The previous value of `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`. After appending `remaining_coins`, the new value of `remaining_cards` will be the previous list plus `remaining_coins`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 1`; `num_cards` is `cards[k]`; `score` is `num_cards * n`; `max_score` is unchanged from the previous iteration; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)'; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`, plus `remaining_coins`.**
