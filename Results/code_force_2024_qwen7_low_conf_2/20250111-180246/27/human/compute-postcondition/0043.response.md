Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is an empty list, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the last element of `a`, `min_idx` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `k` is `k % (n-1)`, and if `min_idx == n-1` and `k > 0`, `min_idx` remains unchanged and `k` is decremented by 1; otherwise, no changes occur.***
