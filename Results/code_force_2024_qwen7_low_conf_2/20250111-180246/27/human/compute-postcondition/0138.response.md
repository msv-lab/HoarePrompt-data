The code `print(out)` prints the value of the variable `out`. However, the value of `out` is not defined in the provided code snippet. Since no assignment operation is performed on `out`, its value remains unchanged. The print statement itself does not alter any variables.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the only difference being that the value of `out` is printed when the code runs.

Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `outs` is a list that must contain at least one element (excluding the first element), and the remaining elements must be valid integers according to the given formula, the value of `out` is printed**
