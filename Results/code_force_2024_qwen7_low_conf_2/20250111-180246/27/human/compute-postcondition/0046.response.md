Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `t` is greater than 0.
   - `outs` is `['min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + k']`.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `min_` is the last element of `a`.
   - `min_idx` is `n-1`.
   - `i` is `n`.
   - `k` is `k % (n-1)`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `tt` in `range(t)`.
   - For each iteration, `tt` starts from 0 and goes up to `t-1`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `tt` would have been one less than the current value of `tt` in the current iteration.
   - Since we are starting a new iteration, `tt` should be incremented by 1 compared to the previous iteration.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `t` remains unchanged unless specified otherwise, but since the loop condition is based on `tt` which is iterating through `range(t)`, we don't need to adjust `t` directly.
   - `outs` remains unchanged because it is a list generated during the loop body.
   - `a` remains unchanged because it is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, and there is no indication that it changes within the loop.
   - `min_` remains the last element of `a` because it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `min_idx` remains `n-1` because it is the index of the last element in the sorted list `a`.
   - `i` remains `n` because it is not being modified within the loop.
   - `k` remains `k % (n-1)` because it is not being modified within the loop.

5. **New State:**
   - After the previous iteration, if `tt` was `x`, then in the current iteration, `tt` will be `x+1`.
   - Therefore, `tt` needs to be `x+1`.

**Final State:**
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is ['min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + k'], `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the last element of `a`, `min_idx` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `k` is `k % (n-1)`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` plus 1**.

In a more simplified format:
State: **`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is ['min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + k'], `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the last element of `a`, `min_idx` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `k` is `k % (n-1)`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1**.
