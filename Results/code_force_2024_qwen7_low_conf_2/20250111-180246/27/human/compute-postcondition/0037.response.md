Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cards`, a list of `n` integers representing the number of cards of specific types, and `coins`, a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available to buy additional cards. The function recursively calculates the maximum score obtainable by selecting cards such that the number of remaining cards does not exceed the number of coins available. The score for each selection is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, where `num_cards` is the number of cards selected and `remaining_coins` is the number of coins left after purchasing the selected cards. The function returns `max_score`, which is the highest score obtained during the recursive process.**

**Potential Edge Cases:**
- If `coins` is less than `n - 1`, no cards can be bought, and the function should return `0` since no score can be obtained.
- If `cards` is empty or `n` is `0`, the function should also return `0` because there are no cards to select from.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not handle the case where `coins` is exactly `n - 1`. In this case, the function might need to check if buying one card is beneficial or not, depending on the value of `num_cards`.

**Final State of the Program:**
- `cards` remains unchanged.
- `coins` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `max_score` is the maximum score obtained during the recursive process, calculated as described above.
