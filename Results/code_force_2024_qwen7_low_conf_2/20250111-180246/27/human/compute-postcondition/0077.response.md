The code `min_idx = i` assigns the value of `i` to the variable `min_idx`. This updates the value of `min_idx` but does not affect the values of `i`, `tt`, `trg`, `k`, or `min_`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is `tt + 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `k` is `k - trg`, `min_` is `a[i]`, `min_idx` is `i`**
