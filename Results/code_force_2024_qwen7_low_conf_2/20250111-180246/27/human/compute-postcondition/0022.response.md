Postcondition: ***`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 1`; `num_cards` is `cards[k]`; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`, plus `remaining_coins`.***

Explanation: 
- If `remaining_coins >= 0`, then `max_score` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, and `remaining_coins` is updated to `coins - (n - num_cards)`. Additionally, `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`, plus `remaining_coins`.
- Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the one when `remaining_coins >= 0`.
