Postcondition: ***`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is an empty list, `n` must be greater than 4, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. If `k` is greater than or equal to `trg`, `min_` is set to `a[4]`, `min_idx` is 5, `i` is 5, and `k` is decreased by `trg`. Otherwise, `min_` is incremented by `k // 4`, `min_idx` is 3, `i` is 4, `trg` is `4 * (a[4] - min_)`, and `k` is set to `k % 4` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
