The code updates the `score` by adding the result of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to it. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

- `score` is initially `num_cards * n`.
- `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` returns some value, which is added to `score`.

Since the exact return value of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` is not specified, we denote it as `value_from_func_1`.

Therefore, the updated `score` is `num_cards * n + value_from_func_1`.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 2`; `num_cards` is `cards[i - 1]`; `score` is `num_cards * n + value_from_func_1`; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)'; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` that are not equal to `i`, plus `remaining_coins`.**
