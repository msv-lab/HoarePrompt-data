Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `cards` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `coins` is a non-negative integer.
   - `n` is the length of the `cards` list.
   - `max_score` is 0.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - For each value of `i` within this range, the loop body will execute.
   - The loop will execute as long as `i` ranges from 1 to `n`, inclusive.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - To ensure the loop executes, we need to ensure that the variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.
   - The initial value of `i` is implicitly set to 1 because the loop starts with `range(1, n + 1)`.
   - The variable `n` should be valid (i.e., `n > 0`).

5. **Final State**:
   - We need to ensure that the list `cards` has at least `n` elements (i.e., `len(cards) == n`).
   - We need to ensure that `i` starts from 1 and `n` is a positive integer.

Given these considerations, the required adjustments for the loop to execute are:

**State:**
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers.
- `coins` is a non-negative integer.
- `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0).
- `i` must start from 1 and go up to `n`.

Therefore, the final answer is:

State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0), `i` must start from 1 and go up to `n`**
