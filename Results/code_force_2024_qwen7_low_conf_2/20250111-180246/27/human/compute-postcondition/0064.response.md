`trg` is reassigned the value of `i * (a[i] - min_)`. Given the initial state, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[i+1]` or `a[0] + k // (i+1)`, `min_idx` is either `i+1` or `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is updated according to the conditions of the if and else parts, and `trg` is `(i + 1) * (a[i+1] - a[0])`.

Since `i` is now `i + 1`, we need to express `trg` in terms of the new value of `i`. The previous value of `trg` was `(i + 1) * (a[i+1] - a[0])`, and now `i` is `i + 1`, so `trg` becomes `i * (a[i] - min_)`.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[i+1]` or `a[0] + k // (i+1)`, `min_idx` is either `i+1` or `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is updated according to the conditions of the if and else parts, and `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[i+1]` or `a[0] + k // (i+1)`, `min_idx` is either `i+1` or `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is updated according to the conditions of the if and else parts, and `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`**.
