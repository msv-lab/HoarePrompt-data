The code updates the value of `min_` by adding `k // i` to it. Given the initial conditions, `min_` is initially `a[0]`, `i` is 1, and `k` is an integer obtained from user input but is less than `trg`. The value of `min_` is updated as follows:

```python
min_ = a[0] + (k // 1)
```

Since `i` is 1, `k // i` is simply `k`. Therefore, `min_` is updated to `a[0] + k`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `k`, `a`, `min_idx`, and `trg`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer obtained from user input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0] + k`, `min_idx` is 0, `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`, and `k` is less than `trg`**
