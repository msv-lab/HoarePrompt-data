According to the given for loop, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n-1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are known:
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `min_` is either `a[i]` or `a[0] + k // i`.
- `min_idx` is either `i` or `i - 1`.
- `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive).
- `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `k` is updated according to the conditions of the if and else parts.
- `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1. Since `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), the new value of `i` should be `i + 1`. Additionally, `tt` will increment by 1 again, and `k` might be updated again based on the conditions of the if and else parts.

The new state after adjusting the values should be:

State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[i+1]` or `a[0] + k // (i+1)`, `min_idx` is either `i+1` or `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is updated according to the conditions of the if and else parts, and `trg` is `(i + 1) * (a[i+1] - a[0])`**.
