The code `min_idx = i - 1` assigns the value of `i - 1` to the variable `min_idx`. Given that `i` is initially 4, `min_idx` will be assigned the value 3. The values of the other variables (`n`, `min_`, and `k`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4, `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // 4`, `min_idx` is 3**
