The initial state is that `n` must be at least 4, and `i` is 4. The code `min_ += k // i` updates the value of `min_` by adding the integer division of `k` by `i`. However, the values of `k` and `min_` are not specified in the initial state. Since the initial state does not specify the value of `k`, `min_` is updated by `k // 4`.

Therefore, the value of `min_` is now `min_ + k // 4`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4, `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // 4`**
