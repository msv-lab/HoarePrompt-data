The `break` statement does not modify any variables; it only breaks out of the innermost loop or structure. Given the initial conditions, the variables `n`, `i`, `min_`, `min_idx`, and `k` retain their original values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4, `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // 4`, `min_idx` is 3, `k` is `k % 4` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
