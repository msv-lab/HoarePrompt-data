The code assigns the current value of `i` to `min_idx`. The previous value of `min_idx` was `0`, and now it is updated to `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[i]`, `min_idx` is `i`, `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the original value of `k` minus `trg`, and `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`**
