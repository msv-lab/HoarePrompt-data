Let's go through the given code step by step:

1. The initial state includes:
   - `cards` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `coins` is a non-negative integer.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is a positive integer going up to `n`.
   - `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]` and `num_cards` is greater than 0.
   - `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)` and `remaining_coins` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `score` is `num_cards * n`.
   - `remaining_cards` is the list of elements in `cards` except for the element at index `i-1` and also contains `remaining_coins`.

2. The code snippet:
   ```python
   score += func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)
   ```

3. After executing this line, the `score` variable is updated by adding the return value of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to its current value.

4. The values of `cards`, `coins`, `n`, `i`, `num_cards`, `remaining_coins`, and `remaining_cards` remain unchanged from their initial state, except that `score` is now the sum of its original value and the return value of `func_1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is a positive integer going up to `n`; `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]` and `num_cards` is greater than 0; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)` and `remaining_coins` is greater than or equal to 0; `score` is the original `score` plus the return value of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_cards` is the list of elements in `cards` except for the element at index `i-1` and also contains `remaining_coins`.**
