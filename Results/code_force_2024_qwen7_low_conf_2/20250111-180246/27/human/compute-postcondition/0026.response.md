The code `remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)` updates the value of `remaining_coins` by subtracting `(n - num_cards)` from `coins`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the updated value of `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, while the other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 2`; `num_cards` is `cards[i - 1]`; `score` remains unchanged; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)'; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)'**
