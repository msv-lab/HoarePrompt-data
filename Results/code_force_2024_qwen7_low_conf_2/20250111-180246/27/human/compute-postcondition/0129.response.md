The initial state is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0] + k` which simplifies to `a[0]` because `k > 0` is not applicable here initially, `min_idx` remains 0, and `trg` is 0 since `k < (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` is no longer true.

The code snippet updates `min_` by adding `k // n` to its current value. Since `k` is 0, `k // n` is 0, and thus `min_` does not change. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0]`, `min_idx` remains 0, and `trg` is 0.**
