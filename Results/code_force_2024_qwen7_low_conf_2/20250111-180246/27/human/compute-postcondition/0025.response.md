The code `num_cards = cards[i - 1]` updates the value of `num_cards` to be the value of `cards[i - 1]`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Given the initial state:
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers
- `coins` is a non-negative integer
- `n` is a positive integer
- `i` is `k + 2`
- `num_cards` is `cards[k + 1]`
- `score` remains unchanged
- `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
- `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`
- `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`, plus `remaining_coins`

After the code `num_cards = cards[i - 1]` is executed:
- `num_cards` is updated to `cards[i - 1]`
- All other variables remain as they were in the initial state.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 2`; `num_cards` is `cards[i - 1]`; `score` remains unchanged; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)'; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)'; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`, plus `remaining_coins'.**
