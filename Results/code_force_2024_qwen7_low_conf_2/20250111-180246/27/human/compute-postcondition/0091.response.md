`n` and `k` are assigned the values from `map(int, input().split())`. This means that both `n` and `k` are integers obtained from user input, separated by a space. The original initial state is no longer valid because the values of `n` and `k` depend on the user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer obtained from user input, `k` is an integer obtained from user input**
