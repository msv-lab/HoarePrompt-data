The code sets `min_idx` to the value of `i`. Given that `i` is 3, `min_idx` will be set to 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the precondition. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `k` is `k - 3 * (a[3] - min_)` if `k >= trg`, otherwise `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[3]`, `min_idx` is 3, and `trg` is `3 * (a[3] - min_)`.**
