The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we were inside. Since there is no loop or conditional statement in the given code, the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1; `i` is 3; `k` is 0, 1, or 2; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `min_` is `a[1] + k // 3` if `k >= trg` and `a[0] + k + k // 3` if `k < trg`; `min_idx` is 2 if `k >= trg` and remains 0 if `k < trg`; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
