To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions and updates mentioned in the given information.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Conditions:**
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `min_` is either `a[i]`, `a[i+1] + k // i`, or `a[0] + k // (i+1) + k // i`.
   - `min_idx` is either `i`, `i+1`, or `i-1`.
   - `i` is `i + 1`.
   - `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1.
   - `n` is the input integer.
   - `k` is updated to `k % i` if the else part is executed or decreased by `trg` if the if part is executed.
   - `trg` is 0 or `i * (a[i] - min_)`.

2. **Update of Variables:**
   - `i` increases by 1.
   - `tt` increments by 1.
   - `k` is updated based on the condition in the if-else block.

3. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i < n`.

### State at the Start of the Next Iteration:

- **`i`**: Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1` (from the previous state).
- **`tt`**: `tt` increments by 1 each iteration, so at the start of the next iteration, `tt` will be the previous value of `tt` + 1.
- **`k`**: The value of `k` will depend on the condition inside the loop. If the if part is executed, `k` decreases by `trg`, otherwise it updates to `k % i`. The exact value of `k` needs to be determined based on the specific condition.
- **`min_` and `min_idx`**: These values depend on the current value of `i` and the elements of the list `a`. At the start of the next iteration, these values will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.

### Updated States:

Since the exact values of `k`, `min_`, and `min_idx` are dependent on the internal logic of the loop body, we can only update the known quantities and leave the others as they need to be recalculated.

- **`i`**: `i + 1` (from the previous value)
- **`tt`**: `tt + 1` (from the previous value)

The other variables (`min_`, `min_idx`, `k`, `trg`) need to be recalculated within the loop body based on the new value of `i`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[i]`, `a[i+1] + k // i`, or `a[0] + k // (i+1) + k // i`, `min_idx` is either `i`, `i+1`, or `i-1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is updated to `k % i` if the else part is executed or decreased by `trg` if the if part is executed, and `trg` is 0 or `i * (a[i] - min_)`.**

For the next iteration:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `tt` is `tt + 1`

State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is `tt + 1`**
