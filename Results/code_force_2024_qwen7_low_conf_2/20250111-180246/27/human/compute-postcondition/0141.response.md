Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `outs` is a list of integers where each element is calculated as `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + (n - 1 - min_idx) + k`, with `min_` being the minimum value in the sorted list `a`, `min_idx` being the index of the minimum value in `a`, `n` being the length of the list `a`, and `k` being the remaining value after processing the list `a`. All elements of `outs` are printed.**
