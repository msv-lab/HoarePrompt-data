Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[i]` or `a[0] + k // i`, `min_idx` is either `i` or `i - 1`, `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is updated according to the conditions of the if and else parts, and `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`. The most internal loop or if statement is broken out of based on the conditions provided.***
