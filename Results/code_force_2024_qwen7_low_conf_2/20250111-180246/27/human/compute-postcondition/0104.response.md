`k` is assigned the value of `k % i`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1, and `k` is an integer obtained from user input. Since `k` is less than `trg` and `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`, the modulo operation `k % i` will result in `k % 1`, which is always 0 because any number modulo 1 is 0.

Therefore, `k` becomes 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0] + k`, `min_idx` is 0, `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`, and `k` is less than `trg`; `min_idx` is updated to 0.**
