The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters directly in its definition. Instead, it seems to operate on inputs that are implied to be part of the test case context, which includes an integer `t` such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100\), and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and \(0 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\), along with a list `a` containing `n` integers \(a_i\) such that \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^{12}\).

Given the output cases are not explicitly defined in the problem statement but inferred from typical problem structures, the function likely processes these inputs and returns a result based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a test case context which includes an integer `t`, and for each test case, two integers `n` and `k`, and a list `a` of integers, and process these inputs according to the defined conditions.
