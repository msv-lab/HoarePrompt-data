Postcondition: ***`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is a positive integer going up to `n`; `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]` and `num_cards` is greater than 0; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`. If `remaining_coins` is greater than or equal to 0, `score` is updated to be the original `score` plus the return value of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_cards` is the list of elements in `cards` except for the element at index `i-1` and also contains `remaining_coins`, and `max_score` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `score`. If `remaining_coins` is less than 0, no changes are made to `score` and `max_score`.***
