The code sets `min_idx` to `i - 1`. Given that `i` is initially 3, `min_idx` will be set to `3 - 1`, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1; `i` is 3; `k` is either `k - trg` if `k >= trg`, or 0 if `k < trg`; `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order; `min_` is `a[1] + k // 3` if `k >= trg` and `a[0] + k + k // 3` if `k < trg`; `min_idx` is 2 if `k >= trg` and remains 0 if `k < trg`; `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`**
