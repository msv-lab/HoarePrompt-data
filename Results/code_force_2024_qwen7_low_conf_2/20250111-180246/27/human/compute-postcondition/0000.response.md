The code assigns the length of the `cards` list to the variable `n`. This means `n` is now the number of elements in the `cards` list. The `cards` list and the `coins` variable remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of n integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `n` is the length of the `cards` list**
