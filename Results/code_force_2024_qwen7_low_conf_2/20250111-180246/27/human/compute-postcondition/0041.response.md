The code `min_ += k // n` updates the value of `min_` by adding the integer division of `k` by `n` to its current value. Given the initial state, `k` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n-1`, and since `k` is greater than 0, `k // n` will be 0 because `k` is less than `n` (as `k` is the remainder of division by `n-1`). Thus, `min_` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is an empty list, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the last element of `a`, `min_idx` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `k` is the remainder of `k` divided by `n-1`, `min_idx` is equal to `n-1`, and `min_` is unchanged.**
