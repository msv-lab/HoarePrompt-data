The code appends `remaining_coins` to the `remaining_cards` list. Since `remaining_cards` was initially a list excluding the element at index `i-1`, appending `remaining_coins` to it does not affect the existing elements of `remaining_cards` but adds `remaining_coins` as a new element.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. `remaining_cards` is a list excluding the element at index `i-1`.
2. `remaining_cards.append(remaining_coins)` appends `remaining_coins` to `remaining_cards`.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `cards` remains the same.
- `coins` remains the same.
- `n` remains the same.
- `i` remains the same.
- `num_cards` remains the same.
- `remaining_coins` remains the same.
- `score` remains the same.
- `remaining_cards` now includes the original elements plus `remaining_coins`.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is a positive integer going up to `n`, `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]` and `num_cards` is greater than 0, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)` and `remaining_coins` is greater than or equal to 0, `score` is `num_cards * n`, `remaining_cards` is the list of elements in `cards` except for the element at index `i-1` and also contains `remaining_coins`.**
