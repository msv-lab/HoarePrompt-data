The code appends the value of `tot` to the list `outs`. Let's break down the value of `tot` first.

Given:
- `t` is greater than 0.
- `outs` is an empty list.
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `min_` is the last element of `a`.
- `min_idx` is `n-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `k` is `k % (n-1)`.
- `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + k`.

The value of `tot` can be calculated as follows:
\[ \text{tot} = \min_ + (\min_ - 1) \times (n - 1) + k \]

After appending `tot` to `outs`, the new state of `outs` will be `[tot]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is ['min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + k'], `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the last element of `a`, `min_idx` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `k` is `k % (n-1)`**
