According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `outs`. For the loop to execute again, `outs` must contain at least one element for the current iteration.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `t` is a non-negative integer.
- `outs` is a list that must contain at least one element (excluding the first element).
- The remaining elements must be valid integers according to the given formula.
- The value of `out` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `outs` must still contain at least one element.
- Since we are entering a new iteration, the value of `out` will be the next element in the list `outs`.
- Therefore, `outs` must have at least two elements left after the first element is consumed by the previous iteration.

Let's break it down:
1. At the end of the last iteration, `outs` had at least one element left.
2. For the next iteration, `outs` must have at least one more element, meaning it must have at least two elements left.

So, the updated state should reflect that `outs` now has at least two elements, and `t` remains a non-negative integer.

State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `outs` is a list that must contain at least two elements (excluding the first element), and the remaining elements must be valid integers according to the given formula, the value of `out` will be the next element in the list**
