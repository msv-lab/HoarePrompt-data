The code sets `min_idx` to `i`. Previously, `min_idx` was either `i+1` or `i`. Since the code directly assigns `i` to `min_idx`, `min_idx` is now `i`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `min_` is `a[i]`.
- `i` is `i + 1`.
- `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `k` is decreased by `trg`.
- `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[i])`, which simplifies to 0 because `a[i] - a[i]` equals 0.

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `min_idx` is now `i`.
- All other variables remain in their previous states.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[i]`, `min_idx` is `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is decreased by `trg`, and `trg` is 0.**
