Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is either `k - (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`, or 0 if `k < (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`. `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is updated to `a[n-1]` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and `min_` is updated to `a[0] + k` if `k < (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`, `min_idx` is updated to `n-1` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and remains 0 if `k < (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)`, and `trg` is `(n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` if `k >= (n-1) * (a[n-1] - min_)` and `trg` is 0 otherwise.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i=1` to `n-1`. After each iteration, the value of `i` increases.
- The loop terminates when `i` reaches `n`, meaning it has executed `n-1` times.
- If `k` is greater than or equal to `trg` at any point, `k` is updated by subtracting `trg` from it, and `min_` and `min_idx` are updated accordingly.
- If `k` is less than `trg`, the loop breaks, and `k` is updated to its remainder when divided by `i`, and `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // i`.
- Since the loop runs until `i` is `n`, the final values of `i`, `k`, `min_`, and `min_idx` are determined based on whether `k` was large enough to cover the last `trg` or not.
