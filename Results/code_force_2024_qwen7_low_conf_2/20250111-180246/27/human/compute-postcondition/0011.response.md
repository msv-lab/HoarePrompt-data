The code snippet updates `max_score` to be the maximum of `max_score` and `score`. Since `score` is calculated based on `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` and `remaining_cards` is the list of elements in `cards` except for the element at index `i-1`, and `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`, the value of `max_score` is updated to ensure it holds the maximum score encountered so far.

The variables `cards`, `coins`, `n`, `i`, `num_cards`, `remaining_coins`, and `score` are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, their states remain unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is a positive integer going up to `n`; `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]` and `num_cards` is greater than 0; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)` and `remaining_coins` is greater than or equal to 0; `score` is the original `score` plus the return value of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`, `remaining_cards` is the list of elements in `cards` except for the element at index `i-1` and also contains `remaining_coins`; `max_score` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `score`.**
