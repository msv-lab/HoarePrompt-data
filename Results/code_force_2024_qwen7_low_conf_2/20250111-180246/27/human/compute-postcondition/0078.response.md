`min_` is incremented by `k // i`. The value of `i` and `tt` remains unchanged from their previous values because the code does not reassign them. The value of `trg` also remains unchanged because the code does not affect it. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `min_`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is `tt + 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_` is `min_ + k // i`**
