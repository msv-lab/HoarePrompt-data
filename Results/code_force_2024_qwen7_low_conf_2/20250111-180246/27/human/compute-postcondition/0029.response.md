The code appends `remaining_coins` to the `remaining_cards` list. Before the append operation, `remaining_cards` contains elements from `cards` that are not equal to `i`. After appending `remaining_coins` to `remaining_cards`, `remaining_coins` is now part of the list.

Therefore, the updated state is as follows:
- `cards` remains unchanged.
- `coins` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `i` remains unchanged.
- `num_cards` remains unchanged.
- `score` remains unchanged.
- `max_score` remains unchanged.
- `remaining_coins` is now included in `remaining_cards`.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 2`; `num_cards` is `cards[i - 1]`; `score` is `num_cards * n`; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` that are not equal to `i`, plus `remaining_coins`.**
