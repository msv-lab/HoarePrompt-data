The code `trg = i * (a[i] - min_)` updates the variable `trg`. However, the initial values of `i` and `tt` are given as `i + 1` and `tt + 1` respectively, but their specific numerical values are not provided. Additionally, the values of `a[i]` and `min_` are not specified. The only information that changes due to the code is the introduction of `trg`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is `tt + 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`**
