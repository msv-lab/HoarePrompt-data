The code initializes the variable `max_score` to 0. This does not affect the values of `cards`, `coins`, or `n`. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of `max_score`.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of n integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `n` is the length of the `cards` list, `max_score` is 0**
