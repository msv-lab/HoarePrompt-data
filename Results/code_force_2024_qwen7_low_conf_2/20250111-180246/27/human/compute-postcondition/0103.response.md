The code `min_idx = i - 1` updates the value of `min_idx` to be `i - 1`. Initially, `i` is 1. Therefore, `min_idx` will be updated to `1 - 1`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer obtained from user input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0] + k`, `min_idx` is 0, `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`, and `k` is less than `trg`; `min_idx` is updated to 0.**
