You are a program verifier responsible for summarizing the functionality of a Python function.

You are provided with:

1. Annotated Code: The function code with comments that include postconditions at various points.These annotations describe the state of the program at different stages of execution but they may not be accurate or complete. So make sure to consider the actual code as the truth.
2. Return Postconditions: The overall postcondition(s) of the function's execution.

Your Task:

- Analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions.
- Determine what parameters the function accepts and what it returns.
- Provide a concise summary of the function state after it concludes.
- Keep in mind that some of the annotations may be redundant, irrelevant or missing some important edgecases so try to keep the context of the actual code in mind as well.
- Also if the annotations say that the code does something but the code has some missing functionality, make sure to include that missing functionality in your summary.
Please avoid describing how the function operates or implementation detailsâ€”focus on what the function does from the user's perspective and how it affects the input variables . What is the purpose of the function? what sort of actions does it perform? What is the final state of the progrma after it concludes?

#State of the program right berfore the function call: cards is a list of n integers where each integer represents the number of cards of a specific type (between 1 and n), and coins is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available to buy additional cards.
def func_1(cards, coins):
    n = len(cards)
    max_score = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        num_cards = cards[i - 1]
        
        if num_cards > 0:
            remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)
            if remaining_coins >= 0:
                score = num_cards * n
                remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]
                remaining_cards.append(remaining_coins)
                score += func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)
                max_score = max(max_score, score)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step-by-step and consider the final state of the variables.
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis
    #
    #1. **Initial State:**
    #   - `cards` is a list of `n` integers.
    #   - `coins` is a non-negative integer.
    #   - `n` is the length of the `cards` list.
    #   - `max_score` is 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Execution:**
    #   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
    #   - For each iteration, `num_cards = cards[i - 1]`.
    #   - If `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`, then:
    #     - `remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)`.
    #     - `remaining_cards` is a list containing all elements of `cards` except for `cards[i - 1]` and the additional `remaining_coins`.
    #     - `score` is updated to `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.
    #     - `max_score` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `score`.
    #
    #3. **Final Iterations and `max_score`:**
    #   - After the loop finishes, `max_score` will be the highest score obtained during any iteration where the conditions were met.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #After the loop has finished executing all iterations, the following conditions must hold:
    #
    #- `cards` remains unchanged as the loop only accesses and modifies the `remaining_cards` list and does not alter the original `cards` list.
    #- `coins` remains unchanged as the loop only subtracts `n - num_cards` from `coins` when the condition is met.
    #- `n` remains unchanged as the loop only iterates based on the fixed length of `cards`.
    #- `max_score` will be the highest possible score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`.
    #
    #### Output State
    #
    #**Output State:** `cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is the length of the `cards` list; `max_score` is the maximum score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`.
    return max_score
    #`max_score` is the maximum score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`. `cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is the length of the `cards` list.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cards` and `coins`. 
#
#- `cards` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer represents the number of cards of a specific type (between 1 and `n`).
#- `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available to buy additional cards.
#
#After executing the function body, the function returns `max_score`, which is the maximum score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`.
#
#Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `cards` and a non-negative integer `coins`, and return the maximum score obtained based on the given conditions.

```

Return Postconditions: `max_score` is the maximum score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`. `cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is the length of the `cards` list.


Now, please think step by step: 
What is the functionality of the function? Make sure to notice any potential edge cases and missing logic.
Look at the code line by line and see if the code does what the annotations say.
You are trying to understand what the code does ans summarise what the state will be after the program executes and the annotations are there to help you.
The anotation is there to help you understand the code but the code is the truth. Only include in the functionality, actions that the code actually performs, covering all potential cases.
Include all potential edge cases and missing functionality if it exists inside your response with the format . Functionality: ** your response here **
