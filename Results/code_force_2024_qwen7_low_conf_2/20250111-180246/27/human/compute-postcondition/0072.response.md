Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[i]` or `a[i+1] + k // i` or `a[0] + k // (i+1) + k // i`, `min_idx` is either `i`, `i+1`, or `i-1`, `i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is updated to `k % i` if the else part is executed or decreased by `trg` if the if part is executed, and `trg` is 0 or `i * (a[i] - min_)`.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block based on the provided conditions.
