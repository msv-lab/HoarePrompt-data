The code assigns the value of `cards[i - 1]` to `num_cards`. The value of `num_cards` is updated based on the value of `cards[i - 1]`, while other variables remain unchanged.

Given that `i` is `k + 1` and `num_cards` is equal to `cards[k]` from the previous iteration, the new value of `num_cards` will be `cards[i - 1]`, which is effectively `cards[k]` since `i` is `k + 1`.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 1`; `num_cards` is `cards[k]`; `score` is unchanged from the previous iteration; `max_score` is unchanged from the previous iteration.**
