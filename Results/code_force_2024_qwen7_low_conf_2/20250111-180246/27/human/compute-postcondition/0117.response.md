Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `n` is an integer greater than 1.
   - `i` is 3.
   - `k` is updated based on certain conditions involving `a[3] - min_` and `a[3]`.
   - `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `min_` is defined as `a[3]` if `k >= trg` and `a[1] + k // 3` if `k < trg`.
   - `min_idx` is 3 if `k >= trg` and remains 0 if `k < trg`.
   - `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`.

2. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over `i` from 1 to `n-1`.

3. **Key Points to Consider**:
   - The loop starts with `i = 3` at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be within the range `[1, n)`.

Given that the current value of `i` is 3, the loop will only continue if `i` can increment to 4 without exceeding `n`. Therefore, we need to check if `i` can be incremented to 4 and ensure that `n` is at least 4.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

- **Check the Current Value of `i`**: 
  - `i` is currently 3.
  - For the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 4.

- **Check the Range of `i`**:
  - The loop condition is `for i in range(1, n)`.
  - Since `i` is currently 3, `i+1` should be 4.
  - Therefore, `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

### Adjusted States:

- `i` will be incremented to 4.
- `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue.

### Final State:

- `n` must be at least 4.
- `i` will be 4.

Since `k` and other variables (`a`, `min_`, `min_idx`, `trg`) are not directly dependent on the loop increment itself but rather on the loop body, these values remain unchanged unless explicitly modified inside the loop.

### Answer:

State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4**
