Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 3, `k` is updated to `k - 3 * (a[3] - min_)` if `k >= trg`, otherwise `k` is 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[3]` if `k >= trg` and `min_` is `a[1] + k // 3` if `k < trg`, `min_idx` is 3 if `k >= trg` and remains 0 if `k < trg`, and `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`. If `k` is 0, 1, or 2, `k` remains 0, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[1] + k // 3` if `k >= trg` and `a[0] + k + k // 3` if `k < trg`, `min_idx` is 2 if `k >= trg` and remains 0 if `k < trg`, and `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
