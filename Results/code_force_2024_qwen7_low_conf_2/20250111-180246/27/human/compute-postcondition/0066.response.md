The code snippet `min_ = a[i]` assigns the current value of `a[i]` to the variable `min_`. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `min_` is either `a[i+1]` or `a[0] + k // (i+1)`.
- `min_idx` is either `i+1` or `i`.
- `i` is now `i + 1`.
- `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `k` is decreased by `trg`.
- `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`.

After executing the code snippet `min_ = a[i]`, the value of `min_` is updated to `a[i]`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[i]`, `min_idx` is either `i+1` or `i`, `i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is decreased by `trg`, and `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[i])`**.
