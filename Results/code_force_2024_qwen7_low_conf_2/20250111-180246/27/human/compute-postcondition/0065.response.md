`k` is decremented by `trg`. From the initial state, we know that `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`. Since `i` is now `i + 1`, the new value of `i` is `i + 1`. The value of `trg` is updated accordingly.

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[i+1]` or `a[0] + k // (i+1)`, `min_idx` is either `i+1` or `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is updated according to the conditions of the if and else parts, and `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`; `k` is decreased by `trg`.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is either `a[i+1]` or `a[0] + k // (i+1)`, `min_idx` is either `i+1` or `i`, `i` is now `i + 1`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is decreased by `trg`, and `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`**
