The line of code `min_idx = i` updates the value of `min_idx` to the current value of `i`. Initially, `i` is 1. Therefore, `min_idx` will be updated to 1.

The other variables remain unchanged: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is now 1 (previously it was 1, now it remains 1), `k` is `k - trg`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[1]`, and `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is `k - trg`, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[1]`, `min_idx` is 1, `trg` is `a[1] - a[0]`**
