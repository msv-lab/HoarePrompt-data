Postcondition: ***`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 2`; `num_cards` is `cards[i - 1]`; `score` is either `num_cards * n + value_from_func_1` if `remaining_coins >= 0` is true, or remains unchanged; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and either the new value `score` or remains unchanged; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` that are not equal to `i`, plus `remaining_coins` if `remaining_coins >= 0` is true, or remains unchanged.***
