Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order. If `min_idx` is the last index of the list and `k` is greater than 0, then `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // n`, `k` is updated to `k % n`, and `trg` remains 0. Otherwise, `min_`, `k`, `min_idx`, `tt`, `n`, and `trg` remain unchanged.***
