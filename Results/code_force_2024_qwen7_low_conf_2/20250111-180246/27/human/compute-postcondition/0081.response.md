The `break` statement is executed, which means we exit the loop or the most internal loop or if statement we are inside. None of the variables are updated by this statement, so their previous values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is `tt + 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_` is `min_ + k // i`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, `k` is `k % i` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
