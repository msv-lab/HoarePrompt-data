The code `remaining_cards = [c for c in cards if c != i]` creates a new list `remaining_cards` that contains elements from `cards` where each element `c` is not equal to `i`. Here, `i` is an index, not an element of the list. Since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, and `cards` is a list of `n` integers, the condition `c != i` will exclude the element at index `i-1` from the list `cards`.

Given the initial conditions:
- `cards` is a list of `n` integers.
- `coins` is a non-negative integer.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`.
- `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]` and `num_cards` is greater than 0.
- `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)` and `remaining_coins` is greater than or equal to 0.
- `score` is `num_cards * n`.

After executing the code, `remaining_cards` will be the list of elements in `cards` except for the element at index `i-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]` and `num_cards` is greater than 0, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)` and `remaining_coins` is greater than or equal to 0, `score` is `num_cards * n`, `remaining_cards` is the list of elements in `cards` except for the element at index `i-1`.**
