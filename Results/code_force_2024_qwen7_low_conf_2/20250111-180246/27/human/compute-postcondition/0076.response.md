The code `min_ = a[i]` assigns the value of `a[i]` to the variable `min_`. This impacts the value of `min_` but does not affect the values of `i`, `tt`, `trg`, or `k` directly in this line. However, it is important to note that the value of `i` and the updated `min_` will influence future operations.

Given the initial state:
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `tt` is `tt + 1`
- `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`
- `k` is `k - trg`

After executing `min_ = a[i]`, the value of `min_` is updated to `a[i]`, and the values of `i`, `tt`, `trg`, and `k` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is `tt + 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `k` is `k - trg`, `min_` is `a[i]`**
