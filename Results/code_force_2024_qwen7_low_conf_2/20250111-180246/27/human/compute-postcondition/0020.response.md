The code updates the `score` by adding the result of `func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` to it. The function `func_1` is called with `remaining_cards` and `remaining_coins` as arguments. Since the exact implementation of `func_1` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact new value of `score`. However, we know that `score` was initially `num_cards * n`, and now it is increased by the value returned by `func_1`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 1`; `num_cards` is `cards[k]`; `score` is `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`; `max_score` is unchanged from the previous iteration; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)'; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`, plus `remaining_coins`.**
