Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n`, which means the loop will run for each value of `i` starting from 1 up to but not including `n`.

2. **Determine Necessary Conditions**: For the loop to execute at least once, `i` must start from 1, and there must be at least one iteration. This implies that `n` must be greater than 1.

3. **List of States to Adjust**:
   - `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop runs at least once.
   - `i` should start from 1 since the loop begins iterating from 1.

Given these points, we need to adjust the states as follows:

- `n` must be greater than 1.
- `i` should be 1 at the start of the loop.

The initial values of `k`, `a`, `min_`, and `min_idx` are not directly related to the loop execution condition and do not need to be explicitly adjusted.

Therefore, the modified state is:

**State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is an integer obtained from user input, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0]`, `min_idx` is 0**
