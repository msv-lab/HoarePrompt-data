The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that `n` and `k` are assigned the values read from the input, but their specific values depend on user input. Other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is greater than 0
- `outs` is a list containing the string `['min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + k']`
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order
- `min_` is the last element of `a`
- `min_idx` is `n-1`
- `i` is `n`
- `k` is `k % (n-1)`
- `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1

After executing the code:
- `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input.
- The other variables (`t`, `outs`, `a`, `min_`, `min_idx`, `i`, and `tt`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `outs` is ['min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + k'], `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is the last element of `a`, `min_idx` is `n-1`, `i` is `n`, `k` is `k % (n-1)`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer**
