The initial state is defined as follows:
- `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order.
- `min_` is the last element of `a`.
- `min_idx` is `n-1`.
- `i` is `n`.
- `k` is `k % (n-1)`.
- `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1.
- `n` is the input integer.
- `k` is the input integer.

The code snippet sets `min_` to the first element of the list `a` and `min_idx` to `0`.

- `min_` is updated to `a[0]`.
- `min_idx` is updated to `0`.

The output state is now:

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0]`, `min_idx` is 0, `i` is `n`, `k` is `k % (n-1)`, `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is the input integer**
