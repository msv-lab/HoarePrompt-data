Postcondition: ***`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 1`; `num_cards` is `cards[k]`; `score` remains unchanged; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`, plus `remaining_coins`.***
