The code `remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)` updates the value of `remaining_coins`. Let's break it down:

- `coins` is a non-negative integer.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `num_cards` is the value of `cards[k]`.

The expression `(n - num_cards)` represents the number of cards remaining in the list `cards` after `num_cards` cards have been considered. 

So, `remaining_coins` is calculated as the original `coins` minus the number of remaining cards.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 1`; `num_cards` is `cards[k]`; `score` is unchanged from the previous iteration; `max_score` is unchanged from the previous iteration; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`**
