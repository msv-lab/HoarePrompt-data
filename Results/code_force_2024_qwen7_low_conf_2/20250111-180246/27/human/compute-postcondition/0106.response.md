Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `k` is either `k - trg` if `k >= trg`, or 0 if `k < trg`. `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is updated to `a[1]` if `k >= trg` and `min_` is updated to `a[0] + k` if `k < trg`, `min_idx` is updated to 1 if `k >= trg` and remains 0 if `k < trg`, and `trg` remains `a[1] - a[0]`.***
