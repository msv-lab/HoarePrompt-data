Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4 and `i` is 4. If `k` is greater than or equal to `trg`, then `k` is updated to `k - trg`, `min_` is set to `a[4]`, and `min_idx` is 4. Otherwise, `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // 4`, `min_idx` is set to 3, `k` is updated to `k % 4`, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
