The code snippet calculates the remainder of `k` divided by `i`. Given the initial state where `i` is 4, `k = k % i` will compute the remainder when `k` is divided by 4. Since the exact value of `k` is not specified, we can denote the updated value of `k` as `k % 4`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 4, `i` is 4, `min_` is updated to `min_ + k // 4`, `min_idx` is 3, `k` is `k % 4`**
