`score` is updated to the value of `num_cards * n`. The previous values of `score`, `max_score`, and `remaining_coins` remain unchanged. The value of `cards`, `coins`, `n`, `i`, `num_cards`, and `max_score` also remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 1`; `num_cards` is `cards[k]`; `score` is `num_cards * n`; `max_score` is unchanged from the previous iteration; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`**
