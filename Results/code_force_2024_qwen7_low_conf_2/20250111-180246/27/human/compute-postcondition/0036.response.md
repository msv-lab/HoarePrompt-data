The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `cards` and `coins`. 

- `cards` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer represents the number of cards of a specific type (between 1 and `n`).
- `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the number of coins available to buy additional cards.

After executing the function body, the function returns `max_score`, which is the maximum score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `cards` and a non-negative integer `coins`, and return the maximum score obtained based on the given conditions.
