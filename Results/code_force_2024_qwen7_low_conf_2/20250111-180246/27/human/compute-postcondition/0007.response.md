`score` is assigned the value `num_cards * n`. The value of `num_cards` is the same as `cards[i - 1]` and is greater than 0. The value of `n` remains unchanged, and `remaining_coins` also remains unchanged because no operations affecting it are performed.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]` and `num_cards` is greater than 0, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)` and `remaining_coins` is greater than or equal to 0, `score` is `num_cards * n`**
