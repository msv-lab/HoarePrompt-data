`remaining_coins` is assigned the value `coins - (n - num_cards)`. The value of `num_cards` is greater than 0 and is equal to `cards[i - 1]`, so the value of `remaining_coins` is calculated based on these values. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]` and `num_cards` is greater than 0, `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`**
