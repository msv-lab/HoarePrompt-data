The code `k = k % i` changes the value of `k` to its remainder when divided by `i`. Given the initial conditions, `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), and `k` is an input integer. The values of `a`, `min_`, `min_idx`, `tt`, `n`, and `trg` are not affected by this operation.

So, after executing the code:

- `k` is updated to `k % i`.
- The values of `a`, `min_`, `min_idx`, `tt`, `n`, and `trg` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `a[0] + k // i`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, `i` is between 1 and `n-1` (inclusive), `tt` is the previous value of `tt` + 1, `n` is the input integer, `k` is `k % i`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - a[0])`**.
