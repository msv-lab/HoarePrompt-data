Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `cards` is a list of `n` integers.
   - `coins` is a non-negative integer.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `k + 1`.
   - `num_cards` is `cards[k]`.
   - `score` remains unchanged.
   - `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.
   - `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`.
   - `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`, plus `remaining_coins`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `i` in the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i < n + 1`.

3. **Current State After Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is currently `k + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `k + 2`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will be updated to `k + 2`.
   - We need to consider how the other variables might change based on the loop iteration.

5. **Variables to Adjust:**
   - `i` changes to `k + 2`.
   - `num_cards` and `remaining_cards` depend on `i`, so they will be recalculated based on the new value of `i`.
   - `remaining_coins` will also change based on the new value of `i`.

6. **New Values:**
   - `num_cards` will now be `cards[k+1]` (since `i` becomes `k + 2`).
   - `remaining_cards` will be the list of elements from `cards` except for `i` (now `k + 2`), plus `remaining_coins`.
   - `remaining_coins` will be updated to `coins - (n - num_cards)` where `num_cards` is now `cards[k+1]`.

7. **Final States:**
   - `i` is `k + 2`.
   - `num_cards` is `cards[k + 1]`.
   - `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i` (which is now `k + 2`), plus `remaining_coins`.
   - `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)` where `num_cards` is `cards[k + 1]`.

**State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 2`; `num_cards` is `cards[k + 1]`; `score` remains unchanged; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`; `remaining_coins` is `coins - (n - num_cards)`; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` except for `i`, plus `remaining_coins`.**
