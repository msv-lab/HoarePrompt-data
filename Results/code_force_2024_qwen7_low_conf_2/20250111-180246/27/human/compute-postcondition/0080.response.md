The code `k = k % i` updates the value of `k` to be the remainder of `k` divided by `i`. Since the exact values of `i` and `k` are not specified in the initial state, we will keep them as they are in the output state, but we will note that `k` is now updated to `k % i`.

The other variables (`tt`, `trg`, `min_`, `min_idx`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is `tt + 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_` is `min_ + k // i`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, `k` is `k % i`.

Output State: **`i` is `i + 1`, `tt` is `tt + 1`, `trg` is `i * (a[i] - min_)`, `min_` is `min_ + k // i`, `min_idx` is `i - 1`, `k` is `k % i`**
