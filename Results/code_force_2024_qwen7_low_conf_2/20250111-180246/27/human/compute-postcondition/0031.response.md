The code `max_score = max(max_score, score)` updates `max_score` to be the maximum of its current value and `score`. Given the initial conditions:

- `cards` is a list of `n` integers
- `coins` is a non-negative integer
- `n` is a positive integer
- `i` is `k + 2`
- `num_cards` is `cards[i - 1]`
- `score` is `num_cards * n + value_from_func_1`
- `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`
- `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` that are not equal to `i`, plus `remaining_coins`

After executing the line `max_score = max(max_score, score)`, `max_score` will take the value of the maximum between its current value and `score`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is a positive integer; `i` is `k + 2`; `num_cards` is `cards[i - 1]`; `score` is `num_cards * n + value_from_func_1`; `max_score` is the maximum of its previous value and the new value `score`; `remaining_cards` is a list of elements from `cards` that are not equal to `i`, plus `remaining_coins`.**
