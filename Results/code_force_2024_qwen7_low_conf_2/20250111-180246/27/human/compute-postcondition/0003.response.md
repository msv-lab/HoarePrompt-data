`num_cards` is assigned the value of `cards[i - 1]`. The value of `i` is checked to ensure it starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, which is a positive integer. The value of `coins` remains unchanged. The list `cards` and the variable `n` retain their initial states.

Output State: **`cards` is a list of `n` integers, `coins` is a non-negative integer, `n` is a positive integer, `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`, `num_cards` is equal to `cards[i - 1]`**
