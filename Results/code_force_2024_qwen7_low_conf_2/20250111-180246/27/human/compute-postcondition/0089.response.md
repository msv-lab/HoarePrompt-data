`outs.append(tot)` appends the value of `tot` to the list `outs`. However, the value of `tot` is already defined as `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + n - len(a) + k`. Since this operation does not affect the values of the other variables directly, they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `min_` is `min_ + k // n`, `k` is `k % n`, `min_idx` is `len(a) - 1`, `n` is `n`, `trg` is `0`, `tot` is `min_ + (min_ - 1) * (n - 1) + n - len(a) + k`, `outs` is a list containing one element which is the value of `tot`.**
