Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem by recursively calculating the maximum score for rearranging the cards. However, there are several issues with the logic and approach taken in the provided code:

1. **Recursive Calculation Issue**: The function `func_1` is designed to recursively calculate the maximum score by reducing the problem size through the `remaining_cards` list and `remaining_coins`. However, the base case for recursion is missing, leading to infinite recursion for most cases. The function should have a clear base case to terminate the recursion when no further improvements can be made.

2. **Incorrect Score Calculation**: The score calculation within the loop is incorrect. The intention seems to be to calculate the score based on the number of contiguous subarrays of length `n` that can form permutations of `[1, 2, ..., n]` but the current implementation does not correctly account for the possibility of rearranging the remaining cards to maximize the score.

3. **Lack of Base Case**: Without a proper base case, the recursive calls will continue indefinitely, leading to potential stack overflow errors or incorrect results due to the exponential growth of recursive calls.

4. **Handling Coins Constraint**: The function does not properly handle the scenario where buying cards is beneficial but not immediately reducing the problem size as intended. Specifically, it should evaluate whether buying one card can help in forming more valid subarrays, even if it doesn't immediately reduce the number of cards.

Given these issues, the provided program is incorrect in its approach to solving the problem.

Correctness: **False**
