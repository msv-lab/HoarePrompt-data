You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
You have some cards. An integer between 1 and n is written on each card:
specifically, for each i from 1 to n , you have a_i cards which have the
number i written on them.

There is also a shop which contains unlimited cards of each type. You have k
coins, so you can buy k new cards in total, and the cards you buy can contain
any integer between 1 and n .

After buying the new cards, you rearrange all your cards in a line. The score
of a rearrangement is the number of (contiguous) subarrays of length n which
are a permutation of [1, 2, \ldots, n] . What's the maximum score you can get?

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t\ (1\le t\le 100) . The description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n , k (1\le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 , 0\le k \le 10^{12} ) — the number of distinct types of cards and
the number of coins.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (1
\le a_i \le 10^{12} ) — the number of cards of type i you have at the
beginning.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5 \cdot
10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single line containing an integer: the maximum
score you can get.

Note

In the first test case, the final (and only) array we can get is [1, 1, 1, 1,
1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1] (including 11 single 1 s), which contains 11 subarrays
consisting of a permutation of [1] .

In the second test case, we can buy 0 cards of type 1 and 4 cards of type 2 ,
and then we rearrange the cards as following: [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2,
1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2] . There are 8 subarrays equal to [1, 2] and 7 subarrays
equal to [2, 1] , which make a total of 15 subarrays which are a permutation
of [1, 2] . It can also be proved that this is the maximum score we can get.

In the third test case, one of the possible optimal rearrangements is [3, 3,
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 3] .

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code step-by-step and consider the final state of the variables.
    #
    #### Step-by-Step Analysis
    #
    #1. **Initial State:**
    #   - `cards` is a list of `n` integers.
    #   - `coins` is a non-negative integer.
    #   - `n` is the length of the `cards` list.
    #   - `max_score` is 0.
    #
    #2. **Loop Execution:**
    #   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
    #   - For each iteration, `num_cards = cards[i - 1]`.
    #   - If `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`, then:
    #     - `remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)`.
    #     - `remaining_cards` is a list containing all elements of `cards` except for `cards[i - 1]` and the additional `remaining_coins`.
    #     - `score` is updated to `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.
    #     - `max_score` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `score`.
    #
    #3. **Final Iterations and `max_score`:**
    #   - After the loop finishes, `max_score` will be the highest score obtained during any iteration where the conditions were met.
    #
    #### Final Output State
    #
    #After the loop has finished executing all iterations, the following conditions must hold:
    #
    #- `cards` remains unchanged as the loop only accesses and modifies the `remaining_cards` list and does not alter the original `cards` list.
    #- `coins` remains unchanged as the loop only subtracts `n - num_cards` from `coins` when the condition is met.
    #- `n` remains unchanged as the loop only iterates based on the fixed length of `cards`.
    #- `max_score` will be the highest possible score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`.
    #
    #### Output State
    #
    #**Output State:** `cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is the length of the `cards` list; `max_score` is the maximum score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`.
    return max_score
    #`max_score` is the maximum score obtained during the loop iterations, where the score is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)` under the condition `num_cards > 0` and `coins - (n - num_cards) >= 0`. `cards` is a list of `n` integers; `coins` is a non-negative integer; `n` is the length of the `cards` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function does not handle the case where `coins` is exactly `n - 1`. In this case, the function might need to check if buying one card is beneficial or not, depending on the value of `num_cards`.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem using a recursive approach to maximize the score by buying additional cards and rearranging the existing ones. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly compute the maximum score as described in the problem statement.

Here’s why:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function should handle the base case where there are no more cards left to consider (`cards == []`). The current implementation does not properly handle this.

2. **Score Calculation**: The score calculation is not correct. The function calculates the score based on the remaining cards and coins but does not correctly account for the permutations of the subarrays.

3. **Recursive Calls**: The function makes recursive calls with updated lists of cards and coins, but it does not ensure that the recursive calls are made in a way that maximizes the score. Specifically, it does not correctly distribute the coins among the types of cards to maximize the number of valid subarrays.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming to keep track of the number of valid subarrays ending at each position. The given solution does not use such an approach, which is necessary for efficiently solving the problem with large inputs.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
