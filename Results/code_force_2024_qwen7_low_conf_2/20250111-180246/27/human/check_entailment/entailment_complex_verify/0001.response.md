Reasoning:

Let's revisit the provided function and analyze it in detail to see if it indeed computes the maximum score correctly.

### Function Analysis:

1. **Function Signature and Variables**:
   - `cards` is a list of integers representing the number of cards of each type.
   - `coins` is the number of coins available to buy additional cards.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `n = len(cards)`: The length of the list of cards.
   - `max_score = 0`: This variable keeps track of the maximum score.

3. **Main Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over each type of card from 1 to n.
   - For each card type `i`, `num_cards` is the number of cards of type `i` in the list.
   - If `num_cards > 0`, the remaining coins after buying `n - num_cards` cards are calculated as `remaining_coins = coins - (n - num_cards)`.
   - If `remaining_coins >= 0`, the function recursively calls itself with the remaining cards and coins.
   - The score for the current iteration is calculated as `num_cards * n + func_1(remaining_cards, remaining_coins)`.
   - The `max_score` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the calculated score.

### Key Points to Validate:

1. **Base Case**:
   - The base case is handled implicitly when the loop ends, as `max_score` is updated only if the conditions are met.

2. **Recursive Calls**:
   - The recursive calls are made with updated lists of cards and coins, but the function does not ensure that the recursive calls are made in a way that maximizes the score. This is a significant issue because the function does not distribute the coins optimally across different card types to achieve the maximum score.

3. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score is calculated based on the remaining cards and coins, but it does not correctly account for the permutations of the subarrays. The current implementation assumes that buying more cards of the same type will always increase the score, which is not necessarily true.

### Correctness Issues:

1. **Lack of Dynamic Programming**:
   - The function does not use a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the number of valid subarrays ending at each position. This is crucial for solving the problem efficiently, especially with large inputs.

2. **Incorrect Score Calculation**:
   - The function calculates the score based on the remaining cards and coins without considering the permutations of the subarrays. This leads to an incorrect score computation.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases, such as when `coins` is exactly `n - 1`, and buying one card is beneficial or not.

### Conclusion:

Based on the analysis, the function does not correctly compute the maximum score due to the issues mentioned above. The function does not use a dynamic programming approach and does not handle the score calculation correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
