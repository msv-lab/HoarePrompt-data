Reasoning:

The given program attempts to solve the problem using a recursive approach to maximize the score by buying additional cards and rearranging the existing ones. However, the logic in the function `func_1` is flawed and does not correctly compute the maximum score as described in the problem statement.

Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function should handle the base case where there are no more cards left to consider (`cards == []`). The current implementation does not properly handle this.

2. **Score Calculation**: The score calculation is not correct. The function calculates the score based on the remaining cards and coins but does not correctly account for the permutations of the subarrays.

3. **Recursive Calls**: The function makes recursive calls with updated lists of cards and coins, but it does not ensure that the recursive calls are made in a way that maximizes the score. Specifically, it does not correctly distribute the coins among the types of cards to maximize the number of valid subarrays.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The problem can be solved using dynamic programming to keep track of the number of valid subarrays ending at each position. The given solution does not use such an approach, which is necessary for efficiently solving the problem with large inputs.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem.

Correctness: **False**
