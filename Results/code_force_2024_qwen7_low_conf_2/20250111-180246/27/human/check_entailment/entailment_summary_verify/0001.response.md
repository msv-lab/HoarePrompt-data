### Reasoning:

The original assessment correctly identifies several issues with the provided function `func_1`, particularly regarding the base case handling, score calculation, and the lack of a dynamic programming approach. However, upon closer inspection, the function `func_1` has a few critical flaws that make it fundamentally incorrect.

1. **Base Case Handling**:
   - The function does not handle the base case properly. When the list `cards` is empty, it should return 0 because there are no cards to consider.
   - The current implementation does not check if the `cards` list is empty and returns the `max_score` without adding any new value.

2. **Score Calculation**:
   - The score calculation is flawed. The function attempts to calculate the score based on the number of cards available, but it does not correctly account for the permutations of the subarrays.
   - The function should consider how many ways we can form a valid subarray of length `n` by combining the original cards with the newly bought cards.

3. **Recursive Calls**:
   - The recursive calls do not ensure that the function explores all possible ways to buy and arrange the cards to maximize the score.
   - The function does not distribute the coins optimally among the different card types to maximize the number of valid subarrays.

4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - While the dynamic programming approach is indeed necessary for efficiently solving the problem with large inputs, the given function does not use any such approach. Instead, it relies on a brute-force recursive method, which is inefficient and prone to missing the optimal solution.

Given these issues, the provided function does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
