Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly implement the solution described in the problem statement. The core issue lies in how the function `func_1` calculates the maximum score. Here are the key points where the program deviates from the problem description:

1. **Recursive Function Call and Base Case Missing**: 
   - The function `func_1` uses recursion to calculate the maximum score, but it does not have a proper base case. The base case should handle scenarios where no more cards can be bought or the number of cards of a particular type is already sufficient to form a complete permutation.
   - The function does not ensure that the base case is reached and the recursion terminates correctly.

2. **Incorrect Calculation of Score**:
   - The score calculation is based on buying additional cards to form a permutation of `[1, 2, ..., n]`. However, the provided implementation does not correctly account for the fact that the function should explore all possible ways to buy and arrange cards to maximize the score.
   - Specifically, the function does not properly handle the scenario where the number of available cards of a particular type is already sufficient to form a permutation without needing to buy any additional cards.

3. **Incorrect Loop Logic**:
   - The loop logic does not correctly simulate the process of buying and arranging cards to achieve the maximum score. The logic assumes that buying additional cards can always improve the score, which is not necessarily true. The function should consider all possible permutations and arrangements of cards.

4. **Missing Handling of Edge Cases**:
   - The function does not handle edge cases such as when the number of available cards of a particular type is exactly enough to form a permutation without needing to buy any additional cards. This situation is crucial for achieving the maximum score.

To summarize, the provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem as described. It lacks the necessary recursive structure and logic to explore all possible permutations and arrangements of cards to maximize the score. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
