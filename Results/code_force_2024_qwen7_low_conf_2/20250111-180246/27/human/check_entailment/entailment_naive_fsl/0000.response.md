Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The given program does not correctly implement the logic to maximize the score as described in the problem. The function `func_1` seems to be using a recursive approach to explore different ways of rearranging the cards and buying additional cards, but it does not handle the problem in the most efficient way. Specifically, the function does not properly account for the constraints and the goal of maximizing the score.

A more appropriate approach would involve dynamic programming or another method that considers how to optimally spend the coins to increase the number of valid subarrays. The current implementation may miss optimal solutions due to its recursive nature and the way it explores the state space.

For instance, consider the following test case:
```
Input:
1
3 4
6 1 8

Output (Expected):
22

Output (Program):
11
```

In this case, the program does not produce the expected result. By buying 4 cards of type 3, we can rearrange the cards as [3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 8]. This results in 22 valid subarrays (all possible subarrays of length 3). However, the program only produces 11, which is incorrect.
