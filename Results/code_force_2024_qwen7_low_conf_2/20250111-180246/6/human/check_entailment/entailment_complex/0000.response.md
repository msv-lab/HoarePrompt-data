Reasoning:  
The provided function `func()` implements the logic correctly for determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit based on the constraints and examples given. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function correctly reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case one by one.
2. **Variables Initialization**: For each test case, it initializes `n` and `k` appropriately.
3. **Logic Implementation**: 
   - The variable `r` is initialized to `n`. This means that initially, Everule can potentially visit all islands.
   - The conditional check `if k >= n - 1:` ensures that if Dominater can destroy enough bridges to cut off at least one other island from island 1, then `r` is set to `1`. Otherwise, `r` remains `n`.
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - When `k = 0`, no bridges are destroyed, so `r` should be `n`, which is handled correctly.
   - When `k = n - 1`, exactly one bridge is destroyed, which would isolate at least one island from island 1, so `r` should be `1`, which is also handled correctly.
   - For `n = 1`, the function handles this correctly because `r` will always be `1`.
5. **Output**: The function prints the correct value of `r` for each test case.
6. **Overall Functionality**: The function processes all test cases as required and prints the expected results.

Given these points, the function correctly implements the logic as per the problem statement and examples provided.

Correctness: **True**
