You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n islands, numbered 1, 2, \ldots, n . Initially, every pair of
islands is connected by a bridge. Hence, there are a total of \frac{n (n -
1)}{2} bridges.

Everule lives on island 1 and enjoys visiting the other islands using bridges.
Dominater has the power to destroy at most k bridges to minimize the number of
islands that Everule can reach using (possibly multiple) bridges.

Find the minimum number of islands (including island 1 ) that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 10^3 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first and only line of each test case contains two integers n and k (1 \le
n \le 100 , 0 \le k \le \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2} ).

Output

For each test case, output the minimum number of islands that Everule can
visit if Dominater destroys bridges optimally.

Example

Input

    6
    
    2 0
    
    2 1
    
    4 1
    
    5 10
    
    5 3
    
    4 4

Output

    2
    1
    4
    1
    5
    1
    
Note

In the first test case, since no bridges can be destroyed, all the islands
will be reachable.

In the second test case, you can destroy the bridge between islands 1 and 2 .
Everule will not be able to visit island 2 but can still visit island 1 .
Therefore, the total number of islands that Everule can visit is 1 .

In the third test case, Everule always has a way of reaching all islands
despite what Dominater does. For example, if Dominater destroyed the bridge
between islands 1 and 2 , Everule can still visit island 2 by traveling by 1
\to 3 \to 2 as the bridges between 1 and 3 , and between 3 and 2 are not
destroyed.

In the fourth test case, you can destroy all bridges since k = \frac{n \cdot
(n - 1)}{2} . Everule will be only able to visit 1 island (island 1 ).

- Program:
def func():
    for t in range(int(input())):
        (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
        r = n
        if k >= n - 1:
            r = 1
        print(r)



- Function Summary: 
The function reads multiple test cases, each consisting of two integers \(n\) and \(k\), where \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n(n-1)}{2}\). For each test case, it calculates an integer \(r\) based on the value of \(k\):

- If \(k < n - 1\), then \(r = n\).
- If \(k \geq n - 1\), then \(r = 1\).

The function prints the value of \(r\) for each test case. After processing all test cases, the function does not return anything explicitly, but the final state of the program is that it has processed all test cases and printed the corresponding values of \(r\). The function handles the following edge cases:
- If \(k = 0\), \(r\) is calculated correctly as \(n\).
- If \(k = n - 1\), \(r\) is set to \(1\).
- If \(n = 1\), \(k\) can only be \(0\) and \(r\) will be \(1\).

There is no explicit error handling for invalid inputs; the function assumes that the input values are within the specified ranges.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

The program is designed to solve the problem of determining the minimum number of islands that Everule can visit given the constraints on the number of bridges Dominater can destroy. Here's how the program works:

1. It reads the number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `k`, representing the number of islands and the maximum number of bridges Dominater can destroy, respectively.
3. It initializes `r` to `n`, meaning initially all islands are reachable.
4. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n-1`, it means Dominater can destroy enough bridges to isolate Everule from all other islands except possibly his own (island 1). Therefore, `r` is set to 1, indicating Everule can only visit one island (his own).

Let's verify this logic against the examples:

- **Case 1:** \( n = 2, k = 0 \)
  - `k < n-1`, so all islands are reachable. Output should be 2 (both islands).
  - Program outputs 2, correct.

- **Case 2:** \( n = 2, k = 1 \)
  - `k == n-1`, so one bridge can be destroyed, isolating one island. Output should be 1.
  - Program outputs 1, correct.

- **Case 3:** \( n = 4, k = 1 \)
  - `k < n-1`, so all islands remain reachable. Output should be 4.
  - Program outputs 4, correct.

- **Case 4:** \( n = 5, k = 10 \)
  - `k >= n-1`, so all bridges can be destroyed, leaving only island 1 reachable. Output should be 1.
  - Program outputs 1, correct.

- **Case 5:** \( n = 5, k = 3 \)
  - `k < n-1`, so all islands remain reachable. Output should be 5.
  - Program outputs 5, correct.

- **Case 6:** \( n = 4, k = 4 \)
  - `k >= n-1`, so all bridges can be destroyed, leaving only island 1 reachable. Output should be 1.
  - Program outputs 1, correct.

Given the analysis, the program correctly implements the logic to handle all possible scenarios described in the problem statement.
