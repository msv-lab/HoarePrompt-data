Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is equal to 1. This holds true regardless of the condition `k >= n - 1`, as there is no alternative action specified in the else part, implying that the value of `r` is always set to 1.***
