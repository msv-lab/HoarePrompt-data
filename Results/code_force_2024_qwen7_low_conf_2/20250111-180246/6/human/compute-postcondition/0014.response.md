The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to `n` and `k` respectively. This means `n` and `k` will now hold the values of the input integers, while the values of `t`, `r`, and the printed value remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t < n\), `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `r` equals `n`, and the printed value is 1.**
