The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it seems to operate on input values for `t`, `n`, and `k` that are not defined within the function's body but are implied to be provided externally. The function is expected to process these values based on the given constraints.

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\).
- Each test case consists of two integers `n` and `k` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and \(0 \leq k \leq \frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).

Based on the provided output cases, the function does not seem to directly return a value from its body but rather appears to handle the logic based on the input values. However, since the function definition itself does not specify any return type or value, we can only describe what it processes:

Functionality: **The function processes parameters `t`, `n`, and `k` where `t` is a positive integer between 1 and \(10^3\), `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `k` is an integer between 0 and \(\frac{n \cdot (n - 1)}{2}\).**
