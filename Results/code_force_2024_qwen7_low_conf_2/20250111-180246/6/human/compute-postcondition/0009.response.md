`r` is assigned the value of `n`. The value of `n` is the first input integer, and the value of `k` and `t` remain unchanged. The printed value remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t < \text{input integer}\), `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `r` is equal to `n`, printed value is 1**
