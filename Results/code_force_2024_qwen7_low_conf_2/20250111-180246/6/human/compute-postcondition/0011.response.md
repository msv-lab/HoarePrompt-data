Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t < \text{input integer}\), `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `r` equals `n`, and the printed value is 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `r` remains unchanged at 1. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables' states.***
