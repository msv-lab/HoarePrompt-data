The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. Instead, it likely takes parameters through other means, such as global variables or function arguments within the context where it is called. However, based on the provided information, we can infer that the function should process two integers `n` and `k` that are passed to it, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2`.

Case_1: The function returns an integer.
Case_2: The function returns an error message indicating that the values of `n` and `k` are out of the specified range.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` (though not directly as parameters) and return an integer or an error message based on the validity of these integers according to the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` (where `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and `0 ≤ k ≤ (n * (n - 1)) / 2`), and returns an integer if the values are valid, or returns an error message if they are out of the specified range.**
