According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0 and within the specified range (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3). Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `t` is within this range.

Given the initial state where `t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, the only thing that needs to be explicitly stated for the loop to execute is that `t` must be greater than 0, which is already implied by the given condition.

Therefore, the state does not need any additional adjustments beyond ensuring `t` is within the specified range.

State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3**
