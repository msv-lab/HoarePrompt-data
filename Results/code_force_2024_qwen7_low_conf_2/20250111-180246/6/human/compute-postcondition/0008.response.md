`n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. This means that both `n` and `k` will be integers, and they will take the values provided by the user in the input, separated by a space. The values of `t`, `r`, and the printed value remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t < \text{input integer}\), `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `r` is equal to 1, printed value is 1**
