The code assigns the value 1 to the variable `r`. The initial state specifies that `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t < n\), `n` is the first input integer, and `r` equals `n`. After executing the code, `r` is now assigned the value 1, while `t` and `n` retain their initial conditions.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t < n\), `n` is the first input integer, `r` is 1.**
