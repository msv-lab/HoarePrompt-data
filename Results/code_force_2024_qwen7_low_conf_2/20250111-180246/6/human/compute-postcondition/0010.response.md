The code `r = 1` assigns the value 1 to the variable `r`. The value of `r` was previously equal to `n`, but now it is explicitly set to 1. The values of `t`, `n`, `k`, and the printed value remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t < \text{input integer}\), `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `r` is 1, printed value is 1**
