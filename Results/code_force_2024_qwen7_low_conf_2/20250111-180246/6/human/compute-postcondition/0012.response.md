The code snippet `print(r)` simply prints the value of `r`, which is currently set to `n`. Based on the precondition, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, then `r` remains unchanged at 1. Since `r` is not modified in the given code, its value stays as it was.

Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t < \text{input integer}\), `n` is the first input integer, `k` is the second input integer, `r` equals `n`, and the printed value is 1.**
