Postcondition: ***`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^3\) and \(t < n\), `n` is the first input integer, `r` equals `n`, and the printed value is 1. Since there is no else part, the postcondition remains the same as the initial state if the condition `k >= n - 1` is false. If the condition `k >= n - 1` is true, then the postcondition does not change either because no modifications are specified in the if part other than the condition check.***
