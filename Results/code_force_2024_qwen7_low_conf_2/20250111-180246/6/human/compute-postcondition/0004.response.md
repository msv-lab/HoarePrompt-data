The variable `r` is initially set to the value of `n`. The code `r = 1` assigns the value 1 to `r`, effectively changing its value from `n` to 1. The values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `k`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^3, `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `r` is equal to 1.**
