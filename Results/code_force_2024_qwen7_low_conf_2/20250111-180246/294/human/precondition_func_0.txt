t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4. Each test case in test_cases is a list containing three elements: n (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5), x (an integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30). The sum of the values of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
