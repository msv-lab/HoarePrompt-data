The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function calculates the number of segments within each list `a` such that the bitwise XOR of the segment and the bitwise XOR of the remaining elements in the list do not exceed `x`. If such segments exist, it counts them; otherwise, it returns `-1` for that test case. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in the input and indicates the count of valid segments or `-1` if no valid segments are found.
