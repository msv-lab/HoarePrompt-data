Reasoning:

The provided program correctly implements the logic to solve the given problem. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown of why it is correct:

1. **Reading Input**: 
   - The program reads all input at once using `sys.stdin.read` and splits it into a list called `data`.
   - It then iterates over this data to extract each test case, storing them in a list called `test_cases`. This approach ensures that we handle large inputs efficiently.

2. **Processing Each Test Case**:
   - For each test case, it initializes necessary variables like `prefix_xor`, `current_xor`, and `segment_count`.
   - `prefix_xor[i]` stores the cumulative XOR up to index `i-1` of the array `a`.
   - `current_xor` keeps track of the XOR of the current segment.
   - The program iterates through the array, updating `current_xor` and checking if the condition `(current_xor | prefix_xor[n]) <= x` holds.
   - If the condition holds, it increments the `segment_count` and resets `current_xor` to 0, marking the end of a valid segment.
   - After processing all elements, if any valid segments were found, it appends the count to the results; otherwise, it appends `-1`.

3. **Output**:
   - The results for each test case are stored in a list and printed out after processing all test cases.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly follows the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
