You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Yarik's birthday is coming soon, and Mark decided to give him an array a of
length n .

Mark knows that Yarik loves bitwise operations very much, and he also has a
favorite number x , so Mark wants to find the maximum number k such that it is
possible to select pairs of numbers [l_1, r_1 ], [l_2, r_2 ], \ldots [l_k, r_k
], such that:

  * l_1 = 1 . 
  * r_k = n . 
  * l_i \le r_i for all i from 1 to k . 
  * r_i + 1 = l_{i + 1} for all i from 1 to k - 1 . 
  * (a_{l_1} \oplus a_{l_1 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_1}) | (a_{l_2} \oplus a_{l_2 + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_2}) | \ldots | (a_{l_k} \oplus a_{l_k + 1} \oplus \ldots \oplus a_{r_k}) \le x , where \oplus denotes the operation of [bitwise XOR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or), and | denotes the operation of [bitwise OR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_disjunction). 

If such k does not exist, then output -1 .

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The following lines
contain the descriptions of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains two integers n and x (1 \le n \le
10^5, 0 \le x < 2^{30} ) — the length of the array a and the number x
respectively.

The second line of each test case contains n integers a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n (0
\le a_i < 2^{30} ) — the array a itself.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n across all test cases does
not exceed 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the maximum
suitable number k , and -1 if such k does not exist.

Note

In the first test case, you can take k equal to 2 and choose two segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 3 ], (1) | (2 \oplus 3) = 1 . It can be shown that 2 is the maximum possible answer.

In the second test case, the segments [1, 1 ] and [2, 2 ] are suitable, (1) | (1) = 1 . It is not possible to make more segments.

In the third test case, it is not possible to choose 2 segments, as (1) | (3) = 3 > 2 , so the optimal answer is 1 .

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
test_cases = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    x = int(data[index + 1])
    a = list(map(int, data[index + 2:index + 2 + n]))
    test_cases.append((n, x, a))
    index += 2 + n
results = func_1(t, test_cases)
for result in results:
    print(result)

def func_1(t, test_cases):
    results = []
    for case in test_cases:
        (n, x, a) = case
        prefix_xor = [0] * (n + 1)
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]
        current_xor = 0
        segment_count = 0
        valid = False
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            current_xor ^= a[i - 1]
            if current_xor | prefix_xor[n] <= x:
                segment_count += 1
                current_xor = 0
                valid = True
        if valid:
            results.append(segment_count)
        else:
            results.append(-1)
    return results



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function calculates the number of segments within each list `a` such that the bitwise XOR of the segment and the bitwise XOR of the remaining elements in the list do not exceed `x`. If such segments exist, it counts them; otherwise, it returns `-1` for that test case. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in the input and indicates the count of valid segments or `-1` if no valid segments are found.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the maximum number \( k \) of valid segments. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Reading**: The program reads all inputs at once and processes them efficiently, which is appropriate given the constraints.

2. **Prefix XOR Calculation**: The program calculates the prefix XOR array, which is crucial for determining the XOR of any subarray efficiently. This is done correctly.

3. **Segment Counting Logic**: The program iterates through the array and checks if the current segment's XOR value combined with the overall XOR value (using the prefix XOR array) is within the limit \( x \). If it is, it increments the segment count and resets the current XOR value. This logic ensures that the segments are valid according to the problem description.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program handles edge cases well, such as when no valid segments can be found. For example, in the test case where \( n = 2 \) and \( x = 2 \) with the array \([1, 3]\), the program correctly outputs \(-1\) because no valid segments can be formed.

Given these points, the program correctly implements the solution for all provided examples and potential cases, ensuring that the output matches the required conditions. Therefore, the program is correct.
