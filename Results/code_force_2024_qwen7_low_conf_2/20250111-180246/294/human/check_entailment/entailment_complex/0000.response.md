Reasoning:
1. The program correctly reads the input data and organizes it into a structured format (test cases).
2. The `func_1` function processes each test case according to the problem statement:
   - It initializes a `prefix_xor` array to store the cumulative XOR up to each position.
   - It iterates through the array `a` and checks for valid segments.
   - A segment is considered valid if the bitwise OR of the segment's XOR and the remaining part's XOR does not exceed `x`.
   - If a valid segment is found, it increments the `segment_count` and resets `current_xor` to 0.
   - The function ensures that the entire array is processed and handles the case where no valid segments are found by setting `valid` to `False`.
3. The implementation correctly updates `results` based on whether valid segments were found for each test case.
4. The function returns the expected output, a list of integers indicating the maximum number of valid segments for each test case or `-1` if no valid segments exist.

Given that the program follows the logic specified in the problem statement accurately and handles all edge cases correctly, the correctness of the provided program is verified to be true.

Correctness: **True**
