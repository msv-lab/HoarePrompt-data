To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and the changes made during the current iteration.

### Analysis:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1`.
2. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `prefix_xor[i]` is updated to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, and all other variables retain their initial values.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:

1. **Update of `prefix_xor[i]`**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `prefix_xor[i]` is updated based on the formula `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`.
   - This means the value of `prefix_xor[i]` is now known and fixed.
   
2. **Current Iteration**:
   - In the next iteration, `i` will be incremented from its previous value.
   - If `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, then in the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

3. **Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`.
   - Therefore, if `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, the loop will continue if `k + 1 <= n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `prefix_xor[i]` is updated in each iteration, we need to adjust it for the next `i`.
   - If `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, then for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.
   - Hence, `prefix_xor[k + 1]` will be updated to `prefix_xor[k] ^ a[k]`.

### Conclusion:

Given that `i` was `k` in the previous iteration, in the next iteration `i` will be `k + 1`. Therefore, `prefix_xor[k + 1]` will be updated as per the formula, and all other variables will retain their initial values.

### Final State:

State: **`prefix_xor[i]` is updated to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]` for `i` being the new value (i.e., `i` becomes `i + 1`), and all other variables retain their initial values.**

So, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`prefix_xor[i]` is updated to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]` for `i` being `i + 1`, and all other variables retain their initial values.**
