The code appends the value of `segment_count` to the list `results`. This means that the value of `segment_count` is added to the list, but the actual value of `segment_count` remains unchanged. Other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `current_xor` is `0` if all conditions were satisfied for all segments, otherwise a value resulting from the last XOR operation, `segment_count` is the total number of segments found, `valid` is `True`, results is a list containing `segment_count`.**
