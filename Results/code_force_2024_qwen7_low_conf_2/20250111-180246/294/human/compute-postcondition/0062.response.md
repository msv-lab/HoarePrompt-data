The `current_xor` variable is assigned the value `0`. The previous value of `current_xor` was `current_xor ^ a[n + 1]`. After setting `current_xor` to `0`, the value of `current_xor` is now `0`. The states of the other variables (`i` and `segment_count`) are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `segment_count` is `n + 3`, `current_xor` is `0`**
