`results` is a list, and the code appends `-1` to it. This means `results` now contains `-1`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `current_xor`, `segment_count`, and `valid`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `current_xor` is `0` if all conditions were satisfied for all segments, otherwise a value resulting from the last XOR operation, `segment_count` is the total number of segments found, `valid` is `False`, `results` is `[-1]`**
