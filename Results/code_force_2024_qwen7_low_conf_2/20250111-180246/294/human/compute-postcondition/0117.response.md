The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `t` and `test_cases`. 

- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `test_cases` is a list where each element is a list containing three elements: `n` (an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)), `x` (an integer such that \(0 \leq x < 2^{30}\)), and a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` (each `a_i` is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\)). The sum of the values of `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).

The function returns a result which is a list. This list contains `segment_count` if `valid` is `True`; otherwise, `results` is `[-1]`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases, and based on certain conditions, return a list with either `segment_count` if valid is `True`, or `[-1]` if valid is `False`.
