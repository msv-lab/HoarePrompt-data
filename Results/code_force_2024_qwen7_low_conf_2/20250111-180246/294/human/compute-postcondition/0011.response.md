The initial state includes:
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `n` is a positive integer and at least 1
- `test_cases` is a non-empty list
- `n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned from the first element of `test_cases`
- `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_xor[0]` is 0 and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_xor[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i-1` elements of `a`

The given code snippet initializes `current_xor` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables listed in the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned from the first element of `test_cases`, `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_xor[0]` is 0 and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_xor[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i-1` elements of `a`, `current_xor` is 0**
