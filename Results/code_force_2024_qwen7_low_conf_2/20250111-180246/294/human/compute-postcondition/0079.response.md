Output State: **`case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `i` is `n + 2`, `current_xor` is `0` or a value resulting from the last XOR operation, `segment_count` is the total number of segments found, `valid` is `True` if any segment was found satisfying the condition, otherwise `False`, `results` is a list containing `segment_count` if `valid` is `True`, otherwise `results` is `[-1]`, `n` is the first element of `case`, `x` is the second element of `case`, `a` is the third element of `case`, `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to `0`**.

Explanation:
- The line `prefix_xor = [0] * (n + 1)` initializes a list called `prefix_xor` with `n + 1` elements, all set to `0`.
- This does not affect the values of `n`, `x`, `a`, `current_xor`, `segment_count`, `valid`, and `results`.
- The value of `i` is updated to `n + 2` as a result of the code execution.
- All other variables retain their states as per the initial conditions.
