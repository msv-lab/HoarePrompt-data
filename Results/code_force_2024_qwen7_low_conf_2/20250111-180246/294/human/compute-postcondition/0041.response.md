The code initializes a list `prefix_xor` with zeros, where the length of the list is `n + 1`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the `prefix_xor` list is updated, and the states of the other variables are unaffected.

Output State: **`valid` is a boolean, `results` is a list, `test_cases` must have more elements to process, `n` is the first element of `case`, `x` is the second element of `case`, `a` is the third element of `case`, `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0.**
