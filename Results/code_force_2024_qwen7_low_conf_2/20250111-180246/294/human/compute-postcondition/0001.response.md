Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `test_cases` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains three elements:
     - `n`: an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).
     - `x`: an integer such that \(0 \leq x < 2^{30}\).
     - A list of \(n\) integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\): each \(a_i\) is an integer such that \(0 \leq a_i < 2^{30}\).
   - The sum of the values of \(n\) across all test cases does not exceed \(10^5\).
   - `results` is an empty list.

2. **For Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The for loop iterates over each element in `test_cases`.
   - For each iteration, the loop will execute if there are elements left in `test_cases`.

3. **Adjustments Needed**:
   - To ensure the loop can execute, we need to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty. If `test_cases` is empty, the loop won't execute because there are no elements to iterate over.
   - Since `t` represents the number of test cases, `t` being a positive integer between 1 and \(10^4\) ensures that `test_cases` is non-empty (assuming each test case is valid).

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is to ensure that `test_cases` is not empty.

**State:**
- `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `test_cases` is a non-empty list.

In summary:
**State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `test_cases` is a non-empty list.**
