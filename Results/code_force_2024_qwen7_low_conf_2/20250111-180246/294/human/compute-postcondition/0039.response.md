Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: We start with the state at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `valid` is a boolean.
   - `results` is a list. If `valid` is true, `results` contains `segment_count`. If `valid` is false, `results` is `[-1]`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs for each `case` in `test_cases`.
   - For the loop to execute again, we need to determine the updated values of `valid` and `results` based on the current case.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - We need to know the value of `valid` and `results` after processing the current `case` in the loop.
   - The loop will continue as long as there are more cases in `test_cases`.

Since the loop condition does not directly depend on `valid` or `results` but rather on the presence of elements in `test_cases`, the key point here is to ensure that the loop can continue to the next iteration if there are more cases.

However, the specific values of `valid` and `results` will change based on the processing of each `case`, but for the loop to continue, these values must be valid (meaning `test_cases` still has more elements).

4. **Updated State**:
   - After processing one `case`, `valid` and `results` may change depending on the outcome of the loop body.
   - But for the loop to continue, `test_cases` must still have more elements to process.

Given the information provided, the most important thing is to ensure that there are more cases left in `test_cases` for the loop to execute again. Since no specific values of `valid` and `results` are mentioned in the continuation condition, we assume they might change but the loop continues if there are more cases.

Therefore, the updated state for the next iteration would be:
- `valid` and `results` could have changed, but the crucial point is that `test_cases` must still have more elements to process.

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`valid` is a boolean, `results` is a list, `test_cases` must have more elements to process**
