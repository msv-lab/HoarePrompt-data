The code appends `-1` to the `results` list. Since the initial state does not specify what `results` is, we can assume it is initially an empty list. After appending `-1`, the list `results` now contains `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `current_xor` is 0, `segment_count` is the number of segments found, `valid` is `False`, `results` is `[-1]`**
