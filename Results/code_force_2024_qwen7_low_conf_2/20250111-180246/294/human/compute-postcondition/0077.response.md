Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is provided as follows:
   - `i` is `n + 2`
   - `current_xor` is `0` or a value resulting from the last XOR operation
   - `segment_count` is the total number of segments found
   - `valid` is `True` if any segment was found satisfying the condition, otherwise `False`
   - `results` is a list containing `segment_count` if `valid` is `True`, otherwise `results` is `[-1]`

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for case in test_cases:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each `case` in `test_cases`.
   - The loop will continue to execute as long as there are more cases in `test_cases`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop is iterating over `test_cases`, the primary state to adjust is `case`, which represents the current test case being processed.
   - Other states such as `i`, `current_xor`, `segment_count`, `valid`, and `results` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the loop itself but by the operations inside the loop body.

5. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration**:
   - The `case` variable will be set to the next element in `test_cases`.
   - All other states remain the same.

Therefore, the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration are:
- `case` is the next element in `test_cases`
- `i` remains `n + 2`
- `current_xor` remains `0` or a value resulting from the last XOR operation
- `segment_count` remains the total number of segments found
- `valid` remains `True` if any segment was found satisfying the condition, otherwise `False`
- `results` remains a list containing `segment_count` if `valid` is `True`, otherwise `results` is `[-1]`

**State: **`case` is the next element in `test_cases`, `i` is `n + 2`, `current_xor` is `0` or a value resulting from the last XOR operation, `segment_count` is the total number of segments found, `valid` is `True` if any segment was found satisfying the condition, otherwise `False`, `results` is a list containing `segment_count` if `valid` is `True`, otherwise `results` is `[-1]`**
