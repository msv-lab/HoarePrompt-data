Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned from the first element of `test_cases`, `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0, `prefix_xor[1]` is `a[0]` (since `prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]` and `i = 1`)**
