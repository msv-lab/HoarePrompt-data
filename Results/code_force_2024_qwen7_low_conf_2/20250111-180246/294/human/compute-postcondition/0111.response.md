`results.append(segment_count)` appends the current value of `segment_count` to the list `results`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1`, `i` is `n + 1`, `current_xor` is 0, `segment_count` is the number of segments found, `valid` is `True`, meaning a valid partitioning was found, and the list `results` now contains the value of `segment_count`.
