The code snippet `current_xor ^= a[i - 1]` performs a bitwise XOR operation between `current_xor` and `a[i - 1]`, and assigns the result back to `current_xor`. However, the initial values of `current_xor` and `a[i - 1]` are not specified in the initial state. 

Given this, let's denote the initial value of `current_xor` as `C` and the value of `a[i - 1]` as `A`.

The operation `current_xor ^= a[i - 1]` can be rewritten as `current_xor = current_xor ^ a[i - 1]`, which means:

- `current_xor` now holds the value of `C ^ A`

Since `a[i - 1]` is a part of the array `a`, its value is fixed at `i - 1`. However, without knowing the exact values, we can represent the new value of `current_xor` in terms of `C` and `A`.

Output State: **`current_xor` is `C ^ A`, `a[i - 1]` is `A`**
