Postcondition: ***`current_xor` is `C ^ A`, `a[i - 1]` is `A`, `segment_count` is increased by 1, and `valid` is `True` if `(current_xor | prefix_xor[n])` is less than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, the values of `current_xor`, `a[i - 1]`, and `segment_count` remain unchanged and `valid` remains its original state.***
