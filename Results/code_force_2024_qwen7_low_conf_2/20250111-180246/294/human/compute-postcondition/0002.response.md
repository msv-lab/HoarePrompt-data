`n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned values from the first element in the `test_cases` list. Since the exact values in `test_cases` are not specified, we can only say that the first element of `test_cases` is unpacked into `n`, `x`, and `a`. The values of `t` and `test_cases` themselves are not altered.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `test_cases` is a non-empty list; `n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned from the first element of `test_cases`.**
