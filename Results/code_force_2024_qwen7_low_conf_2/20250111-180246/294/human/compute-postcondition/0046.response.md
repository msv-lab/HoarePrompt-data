According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `valid` is a boolean (its value remains unchanged).
- `results` is a list (its value remains unchanged).
- `test_cases` must have more than zero elements (its value remains unchanged).
- `n` is the first element of `test_cases` (its value remains unchanged).
- `x` is the second element of `test_cases` (its value remains unchanged).
- `a` is the third element of `test_cases` (its value remains unchanged).
- `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` with specific values as mentioned (its value remains unchanged).
- `i` is 3.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n + 1`. Since `i` is currently 3, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. Therefore, `i` should be 4.

So, we adjust the states accordingly:

State: **`valid` is a boolean, `results` is a list, `test_cases` must have more than zero elements, `n` is the first element of `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of `test_cases`, `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` with `prefix_xor[0]` being 0, `prefix_xor[1]` being `a[0]`, `prefix_xor[3]` being `(a[0] ^ a[1]) ^ a[2]`, `i` is 4**
