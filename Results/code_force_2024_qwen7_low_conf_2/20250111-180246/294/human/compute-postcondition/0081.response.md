The code snippet updates the value of `prefix_xor[i]` to be the result of `prefix_xor[i - 1]` XORed with `a[i - 1]`. This means that the value of `prefix_xor[i]` is dependent on the previous value of `prefix_xor` at index `i-1` and the current value of `a` at index `i-1`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of `prefix_xor` and `a`, let's denote their initial values in a general form.

Output State: **`prefix_xor[i]` is updated to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, and all other variables retain their initial values.**
