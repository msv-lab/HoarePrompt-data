Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned from the first element of `test_cases`, `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_xor[0]` is 0 and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_xor[i]` is the cumulative XOR of the first `i-1` elements of `a`, `current_xor` is 0, `segment_count` is 2, `valid` is `True`, if `current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, `segment_count` remains 1 and `valid` remains `True`.***
