According to the code, the loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `prefix_xor[i]` is updated to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, and all other variables retain their initial values.

Let's break down the steps:

1. The loop starts with `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n + 1`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was some value less than `n + 1`. Let's say `i` was `k` at the end of the previous iteration.
3. For the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`.

Since the loop updates `prefix_xor[i]` to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]` at each step, we need to ensure that the new value of `i` is considered.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was `k`, so for the next iteration, `i` will be `k + 1`. Therefore, the new value of `prefix_xor[i]` (where `i = k + 1`) will be `prefix_xor[k] ^ a[k]`.

All other variables retain their initial values.

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` will be `k + 1` (or simply `i` will be incremented by 1).
- `prefix_xor[i]` will be updated to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`.

So, the new state should reflect these changes.

State: **`prefix_xor[i]` is updated to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and all other variables retain their initial values**.
