Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 2`, `segment_count` is either `n + 3` or `n + 4`, `current_xor` is `0`, and `valid` is `True`. This holds if `current_xor | prefix_xor[n]` is less than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, the values of `i`, `segment_count`, `current_xor`, and `valid` remain as per the precondition.***
