Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `t` and a list of test cases. Each test case consists of an integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a list of `n` integers `a`. The function calculates the number of segments within each list `a` such that the bitwise XOR of the segment and the bitwise XOR of the remaining elements in the list do not exceed `x`. If such segments exist, it counts them; otherwise, it returns `-1` for that test case. The function returns a list of results, where each result corresponds to a test case in the input and indicates the count of valid segments or `-1` if no valid segments are found.**

**Potential edge cases and missing functionality:**
- The function handles the case where no valid segments are found by returning `-1`.
- The function ensures that the bitwise XOR operations are correctly calculated and compared against `x`.
- The function processes each test case independently, ensuring that the `results` list is populated correctly based on the conditions met within each test case.
- The function checks the validity of each segment by considering both the current segment and the remaining part of the list.
- The function ensures that the input constraints (e.g., `1 <= n <= 10^5`, `0 <= x < 2^30`) are respected and does not exceed these limits.
