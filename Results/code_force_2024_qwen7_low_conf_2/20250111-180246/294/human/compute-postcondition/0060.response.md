`i` is incremented by 1 (i.e., `i` becomes `n + 2`), `segment_count` is increased by 1 (so `segment_count` is now `n + 2`), and `current_xor` is updated by performing an XOR operation between `current_xor` and `a[i - 1]`, which is `a[n + 1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `n + 2`, `segment_count` is `n + 2`, `current_xor` is `current_xor ^ a[n + 1]`**
