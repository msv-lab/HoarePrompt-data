Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 2`, `current_xor` is `0` if all conditions were satisfied for all segments, otherwise a value resulting from the last XOR operation, `segment_count` is the total number of segments found, `valid` is `True` if any segment was found satisfying the condition, `results` is a list containing `segment_count` if `valid` is `True`, otherwise `results` is `[-1]`***
