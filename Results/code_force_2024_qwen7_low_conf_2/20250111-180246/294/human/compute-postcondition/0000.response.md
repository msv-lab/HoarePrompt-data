The given code initializes an empty list named `results`. No operations are performed on the list within the provided snippet, and no other variables are defined or modified. Therefore, the only change is the initialization of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^4, each test case in test_cases is a list containing three elements: n (an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5), x (an integer such that 0 <= x < 2^30), and a list of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_n (each a_i is an integer such that 0 <= a_i < 2^30); the sum of the values of n across all test cases does not exceed 10^5; `results` is an empty list.**
