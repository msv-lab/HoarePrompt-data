`prefix_xor[i]` is updated to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, which means the current value of `prefix_xor[i]` is calculated from the previous value of `prefix_xor[i - 1]` XORed with `a[i - 1]`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1. All other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`prefix_xor[i]` is updated to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and all other variables retain their initial values**
