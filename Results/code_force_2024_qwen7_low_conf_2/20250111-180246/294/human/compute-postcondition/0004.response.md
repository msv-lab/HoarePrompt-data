Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary states to adjust for the loop to execute.

1. **Initial States Provided:**
   - `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
   - `test_cases` is a non-empty list.
   - `n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned from the first element of `test_cases`.
   - `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and continues as long as `i < n + 1`.
   - For the loop to execute at least once, the condition `1 <= i < n + 1` must hold true initially. This means `i` must be able to start from 1 and increment until it reaches `n`.

4. **Key Variables to Adjust:**
   - `i` must be 1 for the loop to start.
   - `n` must be a positive integer and must be greater than or equal to 1 (since `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n`).

5. **Additional Considerations:**
   - The value of `test_cases` ensures that `n`, `x`, and `a` are valid and assigned.
   - The `prefix_xor` list is already initialized and doesn't need adjustment for the loop to start.

Given these points, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

State: **`i` is 1, `n` is a positive integer and at least 1, `test_cases` is a non-empty list, `n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned from the first element of `test_cases`, `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0**.
