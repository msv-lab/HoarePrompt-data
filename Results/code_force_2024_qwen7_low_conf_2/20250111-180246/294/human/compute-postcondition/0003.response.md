The code initializes a list `prefix_xor` with `n + 1` zeros. This means that `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is initially set to 0. 

- `t` remains a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `test_cases` remains a non-empty list.
- `n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned from the first element of `test_cases`.

After executing the line `prefix_xor = [0] * (n + 1)`, the following changes occur:

- `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `test_cases` is a non-empty list; `n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned from the first element of `test_cases`; `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.
Output State: **`t` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\); `test_cases` is a non-empty list; `n`, `x`, and `a` are assigned from the first element of `test_cases`; `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements initialized to 0.**
