The code `n, x, a = case` unpacks the tuple `case` into three variables `n`, `x`, and `a`. The initial state does not specify the content of the `case` tuple, so we can only say that `case` is a tuple containing three elements, which are assigned to `n`, `x`, and `a` respectively. The `valid` boolean and `results` list remain unchanged.

Output State: **`valid` is a boolean, `results` is a list, `test_cases` must have more elements to process, `n` is the first element of `case`, `x` is the second element of `case`, `a` is the third element of `case`**
