`current_xor` is initialized to 0. The value of `i` is still `n + 1`, and the list `prefix_xor` retains its initial values. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`prefix_xor[i]` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_xor[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n` is equal to `prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ a[i - 1]`, `i` is `n + 1`, `current_xor` is 0.**
