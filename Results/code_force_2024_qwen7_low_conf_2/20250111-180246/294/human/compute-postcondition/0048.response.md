Output State: **`valid` is a boolean, `results` is a list, `test_cases` must be an empty list (if the loop does not execute) or have more than zero elements, `n` is the first element of `test_cases`, `x` is the second element of `test_cases`, `a` is the third element of `test_cases`, `prefix_xor` is a list of length `n + 1` with `prefix_xor[0]` being 0 and for each `i` from 1 to `n`, `prefix_xor[i]` being the cumulative XOR of the elements `a[0]` to `a[i-1]`, `i` is `n + 1`.**
