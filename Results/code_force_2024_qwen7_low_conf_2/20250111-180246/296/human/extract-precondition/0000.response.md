The provided function `kadane` does not seem to relate directly to the problem description. The function `kadane` implements the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum subarray in an array. However, the problem description involves finding the number of permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums, which does not require the Kadane's algorithm.

Given the problem description, let's focus on the variables in the function signature for the problem. Since no function signature is provided for the problem, I will assume we need to describe the preconditions based on the input and output description.

### Precondition
**t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4**, indicating the number of test cases.
**n, m_1, and m_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5**, where n is the length of the permutation, m_1 is the number of prefix maximums, and m_2 is the number of suffix maximums.
**p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1} are integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n**, representing the indices of the prefix maximums.
**s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2} are integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n**, representing the indices of the suffix maximums.
**All values of n across all test cases do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5**.

Thus, the precondition for the problem is:

**Precondition: **t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n, m_1, and m_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1} are integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2} are integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n, and all values of n do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.**
