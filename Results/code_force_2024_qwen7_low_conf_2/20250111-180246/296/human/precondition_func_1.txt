t is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, n, m_1, and m_2 are integers such that 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, p_1, p_2, ..., p_{m_1} are integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ p_i ≤ n, s_1, s_2, ..., s_{m_2} are integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ s_i ≤ n, and all values of n do not exceed 2 ⋅ 10^5.
