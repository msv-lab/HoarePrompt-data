Correctness: **False**

### Explanation

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution required by the problem description. Here's a detailed explanation of why the program is incorrect:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Subarray Sum:**
   - The program uses the Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum (`max_subarray_sum`). However, the problem does not require finding the maximum subarray sum; instead, it requires counting the number of permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The use of Kadane's algorithm is irrelevant and incorrect for this problem.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Permutation Count:**
   - The problem involves counting the number of permutations that can be formed given the indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The program does not perform this calculation.
   - The formula to count such permutations is more complex and involves combinatorial logic, not just simple subarray sums.

3. **Incorrect Output Format:**
   - The program outputs a single integer for each test case as required, but it uses an incorrect method to compute this integer. It should calculate the number of valid permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\), but it uses a method that is not relevant to the problem.

### Correct Approach

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to:
- Use combinatorial logic to count the number of valid permutations based on the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
- Ensure the count respects the constraints and conditions specified in the problem.
- Use modular arithmetic to handle large numbers.

Here's a brief outline of how the correct approach might look:
1. Parse the input to get the length of the permutation, the indices of prefix maximums, and the indices of suffix maximums.
2. Use combinatorial logic to count the number of valid permutations.
3. Output the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given these points, the current program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, hence the correctness is **False**.
