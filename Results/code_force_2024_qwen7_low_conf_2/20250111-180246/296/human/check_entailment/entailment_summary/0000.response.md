Reasoning:
1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires determining the number of permutations that match the given prefix and suffix maximum indices. The solution should consider these constraints and compute the valid permutations modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

2. **Function `func_1()` Analysis**:
   - The function reads and processes multiple test cases.
   - It extracts \(T\) (number of test cases), \(n\) (length of permutation), \(k\) (number of prefix maximums), and \(m_1\) (indices of prefix maximums) and \(m_2\) (indices of suffix maximums).
   - It uses the `kadane` function to find the maximum subarray sum, but this function is not used correctly for the problem at hand. The problem doesn't require finding the maximum subarray sum for permutations; instead, it needs to count permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The logic in `func_1()` does not align with the problem's requirements. Specifically, it computes the sum and maximum subarray sum incorrectly and does not handle the prefix and suffix maximum indices appropriately.

3. **Function `kadane()` Analysis**:
   - This function correctly finds the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray, but it is not used for the intended purpose in the `func_1()` function.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - Since the logic in `func_1()` does not correctly implement the solution for the given problem, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
