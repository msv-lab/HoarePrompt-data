Reasoning:
- The problem involves processing multiple test cases, each with a permutation of length \( n \) and given indices of prefix and suffix maximums.
- The program reads the input, processes each test case using `func_1`, and prints the results.
- `func_1` uses `kadane` to find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray in the list `a` which represents the indices of the prefix or suffix maximums.
- However, the logic in `func_1` to compute the result based on the sum of the elements in `a` and the maximum subarray sum is incorrect.
- The problem requires determining the number of permutations that could fit the given prefix and suffix maximum constraints. The current implementation incorrectly uses the sum and maximum subarray sum to compute the result.

Given the logic and the provided example, the current implementation does not correctly calculate the number of valid permutations based on the prefix and suffix maximum constraints. The `kadane` function is correctly implemented but is used inappropriately.

Therefore, the overall logic in `func_1` does not match the problem requirements, leading to incorrect results.

Correctness: **False**
