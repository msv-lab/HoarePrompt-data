You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + T * 2 - 2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + T * 2 - 2]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace, `MOD` is set to 10, `index` is `7 + 2 * T * 2 - 2`, `results` is a list containing either `(sum(a) % 10 + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` or `sum(a) % 10` for each iteration, and `results` contains `T` elements, where each element is either `(sum(a) % 10 + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`, or `sum(a) % 10` otherwise, and `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in `a` for each iteration.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `T` is greater than 0, `result` is the last element in `results`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, each defined by integers \( T \), \( n \), \( k \), and a list \( a \). For each test case, it calculates a result based on the sum of the elements in \( a \) and the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within \( a \). If the maximum sum of the subarray is positive, the result is computed as \( (\text{initial sum} + k \times \text{max subarray sum}) \mod 10^9 + 7 \); otherwise, the result is simply the initial sum modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \). The function then prints the results for each test case. Potential edge cases include invalid input values for \( T \), \( n \), and \( k \), as well as an empty list \( a \), which would result in the initial sum being returned directly without considering the maximum subarray sum. Additionally, the function assumes that the sum of \( n \) across all test cases does not exceed \( 2 \times 10^5 \).

    max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]
    for x in arr[1:]:
        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
        
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is an array of at least 2 integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum subarray sum in `arr`, and `max_ending_here` is the maximum subarray sum ending at the last element of `arr`.
    return max_so_far
    #`The program returns max_so_far which is the maximum subarray sum in array 'arr'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `kadane` accepts an array `arr` of at least two integers and returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `arr`. The function iterates through the array while maintaining two variables: `max_ending_here`, which keeps track of the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position, and `max_so_far`, which stores the maximum sum found so far. If the current element is greater than the sum of the current element and `max_ending_here`, it means starting a new subarray at the current element could potentially yield a higher sum, so `max_ending_here` is updated to the current element. Otherwise, `max_ending_here` is updated to the sum of the current element and `max_ending_here`. After the loop, `max_so_far` contains the maximum subarray sum, which is then returned. This approach ensures that even if the array contains all negative numbers, the function correctly returns the single largest negative number as the maximum subarray sum.
