You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Note

The following permutations are suitable for the second set of input data:

  * [1, 4, 3, 2] 
  * [2, 4, 3, 1] 
  * [3, 4, 2, 1] 

The following permutations are suitable for the sixth set of input data:

  * [2, 1, 6, 5, 3, 4] 
  * [3, 1, 6, 5, 2, 4] 
  * [3, 2, 6, 5, 1, 4]

  * [5, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2] 
  * [5, 4, 6, 3, 1, 2]

- Program:

#Function 1:
def func_1():
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7
    index = 0
    T = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(T):
        (n, k) = (int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]))
        index += 2
        a = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        index += n
        initial_sum = sum(a) % MOD

        max_subarray_sum = kadane(a)
        if max_subarray_sum > 0:
            result = (initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % MOD
        else:
            result = initial_sum % MOD
        results.append(result)
    for result in results:
        print(result)

#Function 2:
def kadane(arr):
    max_ending_here = max_so_far = arr[0]
    for x in arr[1:]:
        max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
        max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
    return max_so_far



- Function Summary: 
Output hints for function number 2 : The function `kadane` accepts an array `arr` of at least two integers and returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `arr`. The function iterates through the array while maintaining two variables: `max_ending_here`, which keeps track of the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position, and `max_so_far`, which stores the maximum sum found so far. If the current element is greater than the sum of the current element and `max_ending_here`, it means starting a new subarray at the current element could potentially yield a higher sum, so `max_ending_here` is updated to the current element. Otherwise, `max_ending_here` is updated to the sum of the current element and `max_ending_here`. After the loop, `max_so_far` contains the maximum subarray sum, which is then returned. This approach ensures that even if the array contains all negative numbers, the function correctly returns the single largest negative number as the maximum subarray sum.+


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program includes a function `kadane` which is used to find the maximum subarray sum, but this function is not relevant to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The main function `func_1` reads input, processes it using the `kadane` function, and prints results, but it does not implement the logic required to count the number of suitable permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

To verify this, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3
  1 2
  2 3 4
  ```

The expected output for this case is 3, as explained in the example note. However, the given program will not produce the correct result because it does not implement the necessary logic to count the permutations based on the prefix and suffix maximums.

Since the program does not implement the required logic and produces incorrect results, the correctness is **False**.
