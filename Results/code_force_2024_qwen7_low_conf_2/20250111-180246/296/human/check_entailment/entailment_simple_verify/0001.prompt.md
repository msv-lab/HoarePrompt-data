You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Some permutation of length n is guessed.

You are given the indices of its prefix maximums and suffix maximums.

Recall that a permutation of length k is an array of size k such that each
integer from 1 to k occurs exactly once.

Prefix maximums are the elements that are the maximum on the prefix ending at
that element. More formally, the element a_i is a prefix maximum if a_i > a_j
for every j < i .

Similarly, suffix maximums are defined, the element a_i is a suffix maximum if
a_i > a_j for every j > i .

You need to output the number of different permutations that could have been
guessed.

As this number can be very large, output the answer modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Input

Each test consists of several test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. Then follows the
description of the test cases.

The first line of each test case contains three integers n, m_1 and m_2 (1 \le
m_1, m_2 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5 ) — the length of the permutation, the number
of prefix maximums, and the number of suffix maximums, respectively.

The second line of each test case contains m_1 integers p_1 < p_2 < \ldots <
p_{m_1} (1 \le p_i \le n ) — the indices of the prefix maximums in increasing
order.

The third line of each test case contains m_2 integers s_1 < s_2 < \ldots <
s_{m_2} (1 \le s_i \le n ) — the indices of the suffix maximums in increasing
order.

It is guaranteed that the sum of the values of n for all test cases does not
exceed 2 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, output a single integer on a separate line — the number of
suitable permutations modulo 10^9 + 7 .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine the number of possible permutations of length `n` that match the given indices of prefix and suffix maximums. The key part here is understanding that prefix and suffix maximums define the positions of the largest elements in their respective segments of the permutation. This information helps in constraining the placement of these elements.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads input and processes multiple test cases.
   - It defines a function `func_1()` to handle the logic for processing each test case.
   - A helper function `kadane()` is defined to find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm.
   
3. **Issues with the Code**:
   - **Incorrect Functionality**: The function `kadane()` is intended to find the maximum subarray sum, but it is not used correctly in the context of solving the problem. The problem does not involve finding subarrays; instead, it involves placing specific elements based on the prefix and suffix maximum constraints.
   - **Misinterpretation of Constraints**: The solution attempts to use the maximum subarray sum to calculate the result, which is irrelevant to the problem requirements. The problem needs to place specific elements in specific positions based on the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - **Algorithm Mismatch**: The approach taken does not align with the problem statement. The problem requires a combinatorial approach to count the number of valid permutations based on the given constraints, not a subarray sum calculation.

4. **Correct Solution Approach**:
   - For each test case, we need to ensure that the elements at the specified prefix and suffix maximum positions are correctly placed.
   - The number of valid permutations can be calculated by considering the constraints imposed by the prefix and suffix maximums.
   - The solution should involve combinatorial counting, ensuring that the elements are placed in positions where they can be both a prefix and a suffix maximum.

Given the above issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.
