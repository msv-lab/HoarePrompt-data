Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. The program includes a function `kadane` which is used to find the maximum subarray sum, but this function is not relevant to the problem of counting permutations based on prefix and suffix maximums. The main function `func_1` reads input, processes it using the `kadane` function, and prints results, but it does not implement the logic required to count the number of suitable permutations based on the given prefix and suffix maximums.

To verify this, consider the following test case:
- Input:
  ```
  1
  4 2 3
  1 2
  2 3 4
  ```

The expected output for this case is 3, as explained in the example note. However, the given program will not produce the correct result because it does not implement the necessary logic to count the permutations based on the prefix and suffix maximums.

Since the program does not implement the required logic and produces incorrect results, the correctness is **False**.
