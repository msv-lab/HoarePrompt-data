The code `max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)` updates the value of `max_ending_here` based on the current element `x` in the array and the previous value of `max_ending_here`. 

Given the initial conditions:
- `arr` remains an array of at least 2 integers.
- `max_so_far` is the maximum of `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- `max_ending_here` is the final value after processing all elements.

After executing the code, the value of `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`.

Output State: **`arr` remains an array of at least 2 integers; `max_so_far` is the maximum of `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`; `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`.**
