The code updates `max_so_far` to be the maximum of its current value and `max_ending_here`. The value of `max_ending_here` is already defined as the maximum of the initial value and the sum of the initial value and the next element in the array.

Let's denote the initial values as follows:
- `max_so_far` is initially the maximum of `arr[0]` and the updated `max_ending_here`.
- `max_ending_here` is updated to \(\max(\text{initial\_max\_ending\_here}, \text{initial\_max\_ending\_here} + x)\), where \(x\) is the next element in the array.

Given this, `max_so_far` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `max_ending_here`. Since `max_ending_here` is already the maximum value found so far including the current element, `max_so_far` will either stay the same or become equal to `max_ending_here`.

Output State: **`arr` is an array of at least 2 integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`, `max_ending_here` is updated to \(\max(\text{initial\_max\_ending\_here}, \text{initial\_max\_ending\_here} + x)\)**
