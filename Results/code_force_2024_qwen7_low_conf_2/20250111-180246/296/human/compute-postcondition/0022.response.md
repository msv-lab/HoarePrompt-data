The value of `index` is incremented by 2. The original value of `index` was `5 + n`. After incrementing, `index` becomes `(5 + n) + 2`, which simplifies to `7 + n`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + n]`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace, `MOD` is set to 10, `index` is `7 + n`, `results` is a list containing either `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` or `initial_sum % MOD`, and `results` now contains one additional element, which is `result`.**
