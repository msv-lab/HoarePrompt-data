Postcondition: **`T` is an integer representing the number of test cases, `n` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[3]`, `a` is a list of integers of length `n`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace, `MOD` is set to 10, `index` is 5 + `n`, `results` is a list containing either `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` or `initial_sum % MOD`, where `initial_sum` is the sum of all elements in `a` modulo 10, and `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a`. The list `results` contains the final result(s) after the if-else block execution.**
