The code updates the `max_ending_here` variable to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact value of `x` or the current value of `max_ending_here`. Given the initial state, we know that `max_so_far` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and the updated `max_ending_here`, and `max_ending_here` is initially `max(arr[0], arr[0] + arr[1], arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2])`.

Let's denote the initial elements of the array as follows:
- `arr[0] = a`
- `arr[1] = b`
- `arr[2] = c`

Thus, the initial value of `max_ending_here` is:
\[ \text{max\_ending\_here} = \max(a, a + b, a + b + c) \]

After executing the line `max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)`, the value of `max_ending_here` will be updated to the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`.

Since the initial value of `max_ending_here` is already calculated, the updated value will be:
\[ \text{max\_ending\_here} = \max(\text{initial\_max\_ending\_here}, \text{initial\_max\_ending\_here} + x) \]

The other variables, `arr` and `max_so_far`, remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`arr` is an array of at least 2 integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and the updated `max_ending_here`, `max_ending_here` is updated to \(\max(\text{initial\_max\_ending\_here}, \text{initial\_max\_ending\_here} + x)\)**
