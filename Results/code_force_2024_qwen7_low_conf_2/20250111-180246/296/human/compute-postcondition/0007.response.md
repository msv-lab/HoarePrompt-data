According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the array `arr`. The loop iterates over each element starting from the second element (`arr[1:]`). At the end of the last iteration, `arr` is an array of at least 2 integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`, and `max_ending_here` is updated to \(\max(\text{initial_max_ending_here}, \text{initial_max_ending_here} + x)\).

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: `arr` is an array of at least 2 integers.
2. **Variables**: 
   - `max_so_far` is the maximum of `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to \(\max(\text{initial_max_ending_here}, \text{initial_max_ending_here} + x)\).
3. **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over each element starting from the second element of `arr`.

At the end of the last iteration, the loop has processed all elements of `arr`. Therefore, there are no more elements left to process in `arr[1:]`.

Since the loop is iterating through `arr[1:]`, and we have processed all elements, the loop will not execute again.

**Final State:**
- `arr` remains an array of at least 2 integers.
- `max_so_far` is the maximum of `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`.
- `max_ending_here` is the final value after processing all elements.

Thus, the states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time because the loop has already completed its iterations.

State: **`arr` is an array of at least 2 integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of `max_so_far` and `max_ending_here`, `max_ending_here` is the final value after processing all elements**
