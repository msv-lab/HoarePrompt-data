The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters. However, based on the provided constraints, it implies that the function should handle multiple test cases internally. For each test case, it accepts the following parameters:
- `T`: An integer representing the number of test cases.
- `n`: An integer where \(1 \leq k, n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `k`: An integer where \(1 \leq k, n \leq 2 \times 10^5\).
- `a`: A list of integers of length `n`, where each integer represents the indices of the prefix or suffix maximums.

The function processes these parameters and returns different values based on the conditions provided in the output description. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept parameters `T`, `n`, `k`, and `a` (though they are not explicitly declared in the function definition), and process them according to the given constraints and return appropriate results for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `T`, `n`, `k`, and `a`, where `T` is the number of test cases, `n` and `k` are integers within specified ranges, and `a` is a list of integers. The function processes these parameters and returns results based on the conditions provided.**
