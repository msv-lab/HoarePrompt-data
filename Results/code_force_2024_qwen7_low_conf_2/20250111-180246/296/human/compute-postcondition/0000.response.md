The code initializes two variables, `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far`, both set to the first element of the array `arr`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `arr`, we only know that `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far` are both equal to `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{m_1}` are integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ `p_i` ≤ n, `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{m_2}` are integers in increasing order such that 1 ≤ `s_i` ≤ n, `max_ending_here` is equal to `arr[0]`, and `max_so_far` is equal to `arr[0]`.**
