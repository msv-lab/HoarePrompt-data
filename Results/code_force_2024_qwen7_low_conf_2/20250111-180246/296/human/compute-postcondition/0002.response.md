The code updates `max_ending_here` to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`. However, since `x` is not defined in the initial state and the code does not specify what `x` is, we assume `x` is an element from the array `arr`. 

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is an array of at least 2 integers.
- `max_ending_here` is equal to `arr[0]`.
- `max_so_far` is equal to `arr[0]`.

The line of code will update `max_ending_here` to the maximum of `arr[0]` and `arr[0] + arr[i]` for some index `i` in the array. Since `max_so_far` is also initially set to `arr[0]`, and without knowing the exact value of `x`, we consider the general case.

Let's denote `x` as `arr[i]` for some `i` in the range of the array. Then `max_ending_here` becomes `max(arr[0], arr[0] + arr[i])`.

The output state will be:
- `arr` remains unchanged.
- `max_ending_here` is updated to `max(arr[0], arr[0] + arr[i])`.
- `max_so_far` remains unchanged as `arr[0]`.

Output State: **`arr` is an array of at least 2 integers, `max_ending_here` is `max(arr[0], arr[0] + arr[i])`, and `max_so_far` is `arr[0]`.**
