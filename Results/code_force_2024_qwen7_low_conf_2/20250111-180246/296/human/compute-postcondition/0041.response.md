The code snippet appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is determined by whether `max_subarray_sum` is greater than 0. If it is, then `result` is `(sum(a) % 10 + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10`, otherwise it is `sum(a) % 10`.

Since the value of `result` does not change in this operation, the only impact is appending the value of `result` to the list `results`. Therefore, the state of `results` changes to include the new value.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + n]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + n]`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace; `MOD` is set to 10; `index` is `9 + 3 * n`; `results` is a list containing either `(sum(a) % 10 + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` or `sum(a) % 10` and `sum(a) % 10`, plus the value of `result`; `result` is `(sum(a) % 10 + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`, otherwise `sum(a) % 10`, and `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in `a`.**
