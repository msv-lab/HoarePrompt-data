The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. Given the initial state, we know the following:

- `T` is an integer greater than 1.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + n]`.
- `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + n]`.
- `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace.
- `MOD` is set to 10.
- `index` is initially `9 + 2 * n`.
- `results` is a list containing either `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` or `initial_sum % 10` and `initial_sum`, where `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a`, and `result` is either `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`, or the last digit of `initial_sum` otherwise, and `results` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `result`.

After executing `index += n`, the new value of `index` is updated to `index + n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 1; `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + n]`; `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + n]`; `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace; `MOD` is set to 10; `index` is `9 + 3 * n`; `results` is a list containing either `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` or `initial_sum % 10` and `initial_sum`, where `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a`, and `result` is either `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`, or the last digit of `initial_sum` otherwise, and `results` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `result`.**
