The code prints the value of `result`. Since printing does not assign a new value to `result`, the value of `result` remains unchanged. The other variables, `T` and `results`, are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than 0, `result` is the next element in `results`, and `results` must have at least one more element after printing the value of `result`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `result` is the next element in `results`, and `results` must have at least one more element**
