Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State:
- `arr` is an array of at least 2 integers.
- `max_so_far` is initialized as `arr[0]`.
- `max_ending_here` is initialized as `arr[0]`.

### Loop Code:
```python
for x in arr[1:]:
    max_ending_here = max(x, max_ending_here + x)
    max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `max_so_far` starts as `arr[0]`.
   - `max_ending_here` starts as `arr[0]`.

2. **First Iteration (x = arr[1]):**
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to `max(arr[1], arr[0] + arr[1])`.
   - `max_so_far` is updated to `max(arr[0], max(arr[1], arr[0] + arr[1]))`.

3. **Second Iteration (x = arr[2]):**
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to `max(arr[2], max_ending_here + arr[2])`.
   - `max_so_far` is updated to `max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)`.

4. **General Iteration (x = arr[i]):**
   - `max_ending_here` is updated to `max(arr[i], max_ending_here + arr[i])`.
   - `max_so_far` is updated to `max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)`.

### Final Output State:
- `arr` is an array of at least 2 integers.
- `max_so_far` is the maximum contiguous subarray sum found in `arr`. This is the largest sum of any subarray within the array.
- `max_ending_here` is the maximum subarray sum ending at the current position during the last iteration of the loop.

Thus, the final output state is:
**`arr` is an array of at least 2 integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum subarray sum in `arr`, and `max_ending_here` is the maximum subarray sum ending at the last element of `arr`.**

Output State: **`arr` is an array of at least 2 integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum subarray sum in `arr`, and `max_ending_here` is the maximum subarray sum ending at the last element of `arr`.**
