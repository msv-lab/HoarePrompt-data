According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop iterates over each element in `results`, assigning each element to `result` in turn. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is greater than 0, and `result` has its previous value.

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the following:

1. The loop continues as long as there are elements left in `results`.
2. After the previous iteration, `result` has its previous value, meaning it has not been reassigned yet for the current iteration.

Since `result` has its previous value and `T` is greater than 0, the only thing that changes is the value of `result` moving to the next element in `results`.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `result` is the next element in `results`**
