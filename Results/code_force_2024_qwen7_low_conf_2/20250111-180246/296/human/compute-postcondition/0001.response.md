To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- `n`, `m_1`, and `m_2` are integers such that \(1 \leq m_1, m_2 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `p_1`, `p_2`, ..., `p_{m_1}` are integers in increasing order such that \(1 \leq p_i \leq n\).
- `s_1`, `s_2`, ..., `s_{m_2}` are integers in increasing order such that \(1 \leq s_i \leq n\).
- `max_ending_here` is equal to `arr[0]`.
- `max_so_far` is equal to `arr[0]`.

### For Loop Details
The for loop iterates over `arr[1:]`, which means the loop starts from `arr[1]` to `arr[-1]`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initialization Check**: The loop starts with `x = arr[1]`. Therefore, `arr` must have at least one element beyond the first element (`arr[0]`). This ensures that the loop body can access `arr[1]`.

2. **Variable Adjustments**:
   - `x` will take the value of each element starting from `arr[1]` until the end of the array.
   - `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far` are initialized to `arr[0]`, but their values will change within the loop as the loop progresses.

### Required States
Based on the analysis, we need to ensure that the loop can start and iterate correctly. Specifically:

- The array `arr` must have at least two elements (since the loop starts at `arr[1]`).
- The initial values of `max_ending_here` and `max_so_far` are set to `arr[0]`.

### Final Answer
State: **`arr` is an array of at least 2 integers, `max_ending_here` is equal to `arr[0]`, and `max_so_far` is equal to `arr[0]`**.
