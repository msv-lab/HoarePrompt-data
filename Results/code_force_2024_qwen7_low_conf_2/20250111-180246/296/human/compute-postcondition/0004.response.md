Let's break down the problem step by step to understand the changes needed in the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Initial Understanding
- The loop iterates over each element in `arr` starting from the second element (index 1).
- For each element `x` in `arr[1:]`, the loop updates `max_ending_here` as `max(arr[0], arr[0] + x)`.
- `max_so_far` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `max_ending_here`.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration
- `max_so_far` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and `max_ending_here` for the first element.
- `max_ending_here` is `max(arr[0], arr[0] + arr[1])` for the first iteration.
- We don't know the exact value of `arr[1]`, but we know that `max_ending_here` is either `arr[0]` or `arr[0] + arr[1]`, whichever is larger.

### Next Iteration
- The loop will now process the next element, say `arr[2]`.
- `max_ending_here` will be updated to `max(arr[0], arr[0] + arr[1], arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2])`.
- `max_so_far` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `max_ending_here`.

### Adjusted States
- `arr` remains the same array of at least 2 integers.
- `max_so_far` needs to be the maximum of its current value and the new `max_ending_here` which includes the new element `arr[2]`.
- `max_ending_here` will be updated based on the new element `arr[2]`.

### Final State
State: **`arr` is an array of at least 2 integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and the updated `max_ending_here`, and `max_ending_here` is `max(arr[0], arr[0] + arr[1], arr[0] + arr[1] + arr[2])`**.

This captures the necessary adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time.
