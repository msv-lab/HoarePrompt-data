Let's break down the provided code snippet:

```python
initial_sum = sum(a) % MOD
```

- `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers.
- `index` is `7 + 2 * n`.
- `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace.
- `MOD` is set to 10.

### Step-by-Step Execution:

1. **Compute `sum(a)`**: This computes the sum of all integers in the list `a`.
2. **Apply Modulo Operation**: `% MOD` ensures that the result is within the range `[0, 9]`.

The value of `initial_sum` is the sum of the integers in `a` modulo 10. 

Since the exact values of `a` are not specified, let's denote the sum of the elements in `a` as `S`. Thus, `initial_sum` will be `S % 10`.

### Impact on Variables:

- `T` remains unchanged because it is not referenced in the code.
- `n` remains unchanged because it is not referenced in the code.
- `k` remains unchanged because it is not referenced in the code.
- `a` remains unchanged because it is not referenced in the code.
- `data` remains unchanged because it is not referenced in the code.
- `index` remains unchanged because it is not referenced in the code.
- `MOD` remains unchanged because it is not referenced in the code.
- `results` now contains an additional element, which is `initial_sum`.

### Updated Values:

- `results` now contains two elements: the first is `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` or `initial_sum % 10`, and the second is `initial_sum`.

### Output State:

**Output State: `T` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace, `MOD` is set to 10, `index` is `7 + 2 * n`, `results` is a list containing either `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` or `initial_sum % MOD`, and `results` now contains an additional element, which is `initial_sum`.**

This simplifies to:

**Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace, `MOD` is set to 10, `index` is `7 + 2 * n`, `results` is a list containing `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` or `initial_sum % 10` and `initial_sum`.**
