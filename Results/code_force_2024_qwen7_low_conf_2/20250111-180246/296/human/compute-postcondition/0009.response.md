The code updates `max_so_far` to be the maximum of its current value and `max_ending_here`. Since `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`, `max_so_far` will now be the maximum value between its original value and the updated `max_ending_here`. The values of `arr`, `max_ending_here`, and `x` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`arr` remains an array of at least 2 integers; `max_so_far` is the maximum of its original value and `max_ending_here`; `max_ending_here` is updated to be the maximum of `x` and `max_ending_here + x`.**
