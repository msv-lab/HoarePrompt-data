Functionality: **The function `kadane` accepts an array `arr` of at least two integers and returns the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray within `arr`. The function iterates through the array while maintaining two variables: `max_ending_here`, which keeps track of the maximum sum of the subarray ending at the current position, and `max_so_far`, which stores the maximum sum found so far. If the current element is greater than the sum of the current element and `max_ending_here`, it means starting a new subarray at the current element could potentially yield a higher sum, so `max_ending_here` is updated to the current element. Otherwise, `max_ending_here` is updated to the sum of the current element and `max_ending_here`. After the loop, `max_so_far` contains the maximum subarray sum, which is then returned. This approach ensures that even if the array contains all negative numbers, the function correctly returns the single largest negative number as the maximum subarray sum.**

This summary includes the core functionality of the Kadane's algorithm, as well as potential edge cases where all elements in the array are negative.
