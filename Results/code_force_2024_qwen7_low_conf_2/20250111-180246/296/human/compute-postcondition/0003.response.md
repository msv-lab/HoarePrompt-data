The code updates `max_so_far` to be the maximum between its current value and `max_ending_here`. The value of `max_ending_here` is defined as `max(arr[0], arr[0] + arr[i])`, which means it is the maximum sum of a subarray ending at index `i`.

Given the initial state, `max_so_far` is initialized as `arr[0]`. After executing the line `max_so_far = max(max_so_far, max_ending_here)`, `max_so_far` will be updated to be the larger of its original value (`arr[0]`) and `max_ending_here`.

Since `max_ending_here` is already defined as `max(arr[0], arr[0] + arr[i])`, and given that `max_so_far` starts as `arr[0]`, the line of code ensures that `max_so_far` will be at least `arr[0]`. However, without knowing the exact values in `arr`, we cannot determine a more specific value for `max_so_far` than saying it is the maximum of `arr[0]` and `max_ending_here`.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`arr` is an array of at least 2 integers, `max_so_far` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and `max_ending_here`, and `max_ending_here` is `max(arr[0], arr[0] + arr[i])`.**
