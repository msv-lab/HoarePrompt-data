The code `index += 2` increments the value of `index` by 2. Given the initial state, `index` is initially set to `7 + 2 * n`. After executing the code, `index` becomes `(7 + 2 * n) + 2 = 9 + 2 * n`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer greater than 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[5 + n]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[6 + n]`, `a` is a list of integers obtained by converting `data[index:index + n]` to integers, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string by whitespace, `MOD` is set to 10, `index` is `9 + 2 * n`, `results` is a list containing either `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` or `initial_sum % 10` and `initial_sum`, where `max_subarray_sum` is the maximum subarray sum of `a`, and `result` is either `(initial_sum + k * max_subarray_sum) % 10` if `max_subarray_sum > 0`, or the last digit of `initial_sum` otherwise, and `results` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `result`, and `T` is `T - 1`.**
