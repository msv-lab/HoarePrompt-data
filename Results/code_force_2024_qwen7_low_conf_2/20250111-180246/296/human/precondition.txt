t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4; for each test case, n, m_1, and m_2 are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ m_1, m_2 ≤ n ≤ 2⋅10^5; p_1 < p_2 < ... < p_{m_1} and s_1 < s_2 < ... < s_{m_2} are lists of integers where 1 ≤ p_i, s_i ≤ n for all i; the sum of all n across all test cases does not exceed 2⋅10^5; the values of t, n, m_1, m_2, p_i, and s_i are provided as described in the problem statement.
