You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: There are balls of n different colors; the number of balls of the i -th color
is a_i .

The balls can be combined into groups. Each group should contain at most 2
balls, and no more than 1 ball of each color.

Consider all 2^n sets of colors. For a set of colors, let's denote its value
as the minimum number of groups the balls of those colors can be distributed
into. For example, if there are three colors with 3 , 1 and 7 balls
respectively, they can be combined into 7 groups (and not less than 7 ), so
the value of that set of colors is 7 .

Your task is to calculate the sum of values over all 2^n possible sets of
colors. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) — the number of
colors.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 5000 )
— the number of balls of the i -th color.

Additional constraint on input: the total number of balls doesn't exceed 5000
.

Output

Print a single integer — the sum of values of all 2^n sets of colors, taken
modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

Consider the first example. There are 8 sets of colors:

  * for the empty set, its value is 0 ; 
  * for the set \\{1\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{2\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,2\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{2,3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,2,3\\} , its value is 2 . 

So, the sum of values over all 2^n sets of colors is 11 .
Function definition:
```
def func_1(n, a):
