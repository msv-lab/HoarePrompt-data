Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The task is to compute the sum of the minimum number of groups needed for each possible subset of balls, considering the constraints and the modulo operation.
2. **Given Code Analysis**:
   - The code reads the input values correctly.
   - The function `func_1` iterates over all possible subsets using a bitmask (`mask`), checking which colors are included in each subset.
   - For each subset, it finds the maximum number of balls of any color included in that subset and adds this value to `total_value`.
   - Finally, it returns `total_value` modulo `998244353`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - The function correctly calculates the maximum number of balls for each subset.
   - The use of bitmasking is appropriate for generating all subsets efficiently.
   - The logic handles all cases within the given constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 5000 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 5000).

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 1.
   - It correctly handles cases where all elements in `a` are the same or where `a` contains duplicate values.
   - Although the problem specifies `1 ≤ n ≤ 5000`, the function does not explicitly handle `n = 0`. However, since `n = 0` is not a valid case in the problem statement, this omission is not a concern.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The result is taken modulo `998244353` as required by the problem statement.

Based on the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem as specified.

Correctness: **True**
