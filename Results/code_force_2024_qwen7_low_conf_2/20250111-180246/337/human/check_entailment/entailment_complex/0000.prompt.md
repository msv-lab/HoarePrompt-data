You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There are balls of n different colors; the number of balls of the i -th color
is a_i .

The balls can be combined into groups. Each group should contain at most 2
balls, and no more than 1 ball of each color.

Consider all 2^n sets of colors. For a set of colors, let's denote its value
as the minimum number of groups the balls of those colors can be distributed
into. For example, if there are three colors with 3 , 1 and 7 balls
respectively, they can be combined into 7 groups (and not less than 7 ), so
the value of that set of colors is 7 .

Your task is to calculate the sum of values over all 2^n possible sets of
colors. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) — the number of
colors.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 5000 )
— the number of balls of the i -th color.

Additional constraint on input: the total number of balls doesn't exceed 5000
.

Output

Print a single integer — the sum of values of all 2^n sets of colors, taken
modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

Consider the first example. There are 8 sets of colors:

  * for the empty set, its value is 0 ; 
  * for the set \\{1\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{2\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,2\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{2,3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,2,3\\} , its value is 2 . 

So, the sum of values over all 2^n sets of colors is 11 .

# Annotated Program:
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = func_1(n, a)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 5000.
def func_1(n, a):
    MOD = 998244353
    total_value = 0
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        max_balls = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & 1 << i != 0:
                max_balls = max(max_balls, a[i])
        
        total_value = (total_value + max_balls) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_value` is the sum of the maximum values for each possible subset of the list `a`, modulo `998244353`; `n` is a non-negative integer within the range `1 <= n <= 5000`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 5000`; `mask` is an integer ranging from `0` to `2^n - 1`.
    return total_value
    #The program returns total_value which is the sum of the maximum values for each possible subset of the list 'a', modulo 998244353
#Overall this is what the function does:- The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 1, as there is only one non-empty subset.
- The function correctly handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.
- The function correctly handles the case where `a` contains duplicate values.
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0. Since the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 5000`, this edge case is not relevant here. However, if the function were to be extended to include `n = 0`, it would need to return 0, as there are no non-empty subsets.
