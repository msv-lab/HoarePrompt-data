You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There are balls of n different colors; the number of balls of the i -th color
is a_i .

The balls can be combined into groups. Each group should contain at most 2
balls, and no more than 1 ball of each color.

Consider all 2^n sets of colors. For a set of colors, let's denote its value
as the minimum number of groups the balls of those colors can be distributed
into. For example, if there are three colors with 3 , 1 and 7 balls
respectively, they can be combined into 7 groups (and not less than 7 ), so
the value of that set of colors is 7 .

Your task is to calculate the sum of values over all 2^n possible sets of
colors. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) — the number of
colors.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 5000 )
— the number of balls of the i -th color.

Additional constraint on input: the total number of balls doesn't exceed 5000
.

Output

Print a single integer — the sum of values of all 2^n sets of colors, taken
modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

Consider the first example. There are 8 sets of colors:

  * for the empty set, its value is 0 ; 
  * for the set \\{1\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{2\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,2\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{2,3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,2,3\\} , its value is 2 . 

So, the sum of values over all 2^n sets of colors is 11 .

- Program: 
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = func_1(n, a)
print(result)

    MOD = 998244353
    total_value = 0
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        max_balls = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & 1 << i != 0:
                max_balls = max(max_balls, a[i])
        total_value = (total_value + max_balls) % MOD
    return total_value



- Annotated Code: 
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = func_1(n, a)
print(result)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 5000.
def func_1(n, a):
    MOD = 998244353
    total_value = 0
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        max_balls = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & 1 << i != 0:
                max_balls = max(max_balls, a[i])
        
        total_value = (total_value + max_balls) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_value` is the sum of the maximum values for each possible subset of the list `a`, modulo `998244353`; `n` is a non-negative integer within the range `1 <= n <= 5000`; `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 5000`; `mask` is an integer ranging from `0` to `2^n - 1`.
    return total_value
    #The program returns total_value which is the sum of the maximum values for each possible subset of the list 'a', modulo 998244353



Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
1. The program correctly calculates the sum of values over all \(2^n\) possible sets of colors.
2. The main loop iterates through all possible subsets of the given colors using a bitmask approach. This ensures that every combination of colors is considered.
3. For each subset, the program determines the maximum number of balls of any color in that subset (`max_balls`), which represents the minimum number of groups needed to place the balls of that subset.
4. The `total_value` is updated by adding `max_balls` for each subset and taking the result modulo \(998244353\).
5. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
