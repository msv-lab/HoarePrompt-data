Reasoning:
1. The program correctly calculates the sum of values over all \(2^n\) possible sets of colors.
2. The main loop iterates through all possible subsets of the given colors using a bitmask approach. This ensures that every combination of colors is considered.
3. For each subset, the program determines the maximum number of balls of any color in that subset (`max_balls`), which represents the minimum number of groups needed to place the balls of that subset.
4. The `total_value` is updated by adding `max_balls` for each subset and taking the result modulo \(998244353\).
5. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Given the above points, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
