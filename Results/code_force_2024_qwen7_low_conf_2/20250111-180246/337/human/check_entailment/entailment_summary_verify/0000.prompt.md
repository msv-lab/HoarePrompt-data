You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are balls of n different colors; the number of balls of the i -th color
is a_i .

The balls can be combined into groups. Each group should contain at most 2
balls, and no more than 1 ball of each color.

Consider all 2^n sets of colors. For a set of colors, let's denote its value
as the minimum number of groups the balls of those colors can be distributed
into. For example, if there are three colors with 3 , 1 and 7 balls
respectively, they can be combined into 7 groups (and not less than 7 ), so
the value of that set of colors is 7 .

Your task is to calculate the sum of values over all 2^n possible sets of
colors. Since the answer may be too large, print it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

The first line contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000 ) — the number of
colors.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 5000 )
— the number of balls of the i -th color.

Additional constraint on input: the total number of balls doesn't exceed 5000
.

Output

Print a single integer — the sum of values of all 2^n sets of colors, taken
modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

Consider the first example. There are 8 sets of colors:

  * for the empty set, its value is 0 ; 
  * for the set \\{1\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{2\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,2\\} , its value is 1 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{2,3\\} , its value is 2 ; 
  * for the set \\{1,2,3\\} , its value is 2 . 

So, the sum of values over all 2^n sets of colors is 11 .

- Program:
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
result = func_1(n, a)
print(result)

def func_1(n, a):
    MOD = 998244353
    total_value = 0
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        max_balls = 0
        for i in range(n):
            if mask & 1 << i != 0:
                max_balls = max(max_balls, a[i])
        total_value = (total_value + max_balls) % MOD
    return total_value



- Function Summary: 
- The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 1, as there is only one non-empty subset.
- The function correctly handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.
- The function correctly handles the case where `a` contains duplicate values.
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0. Since the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 5000`, this edge case is not relevant here. However, if the function were to be extended to include `n = 0`, it would need to return 0, as there are no non-empty subsets.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of values over all \(2^n\) possible sets of colors. The function `func_1` iterates through all possible subsets of colors using a bitmask approach. For each subset, it calculates the maximum number of balls among the selected colors, which represents the minimum number of groups required for that subset. This value is then added to the total value, and the result is taken modulo \(998,244,353\).

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly processes the input and computes the required output for various inputs within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
