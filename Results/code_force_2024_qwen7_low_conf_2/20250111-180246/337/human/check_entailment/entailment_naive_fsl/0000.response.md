Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of values over all \(2^n\) possible sets of colors. The function `func_1` iterates through all possible subsets of colors using a bitmask approach. For each subset, it calculates the maximum number of balls among the selected colors, which represents the minimum number of groups required for that subset. This value is then added to the total value, and the result is taken modulo \(998,244,353\).

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly processes the input and computes the required output for various inputs within the given constraints. Therefore, the program is correct.
