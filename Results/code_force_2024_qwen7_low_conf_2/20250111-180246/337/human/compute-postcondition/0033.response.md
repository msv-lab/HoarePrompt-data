Postcondition: **`total_value` is 0, `mask` is \(2^n - 2\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `max_balls` is 0, and the current value of `(mask & 1 << i)` is not 0**
