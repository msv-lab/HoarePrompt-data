The line of code `max_balls = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `max_balls`. The values of the other variables (`total_value`, `n`, `a`, and `mask`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`total_value` is 0, `n` is within the range 1 <= n <= 5000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 5000, `mask` is 0, `max_balls` is 0**
