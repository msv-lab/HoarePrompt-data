The code initializes the variable `total_value` to 0. This does not change the values of `n`, `a`, or `MOD`. Therefore, the only change is in the value of `total_value`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 5000; `MOD` is 998244353; `total_value` is 0**
