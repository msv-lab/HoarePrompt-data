Postcondition: ***`mask` and `a` are as follows: if the `i`-th bit of `mask` is set (i.e., `mask & 1 << i` is true), then `max_balls` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`, and `a[i]` remains unchanged. If the `i`-th bit of `mask` is not set, then `max_balls` and `a[i]` remain unchanged.***
