Postcondition: **`total_value` is 0, `mask` is \(2^n - 2\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is \(n\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), and `max_balls` is either `a[n]` if the bit at position `i` in `mask` is set (i.e., \(mask \& (1 << i) \neq 0\)), or remains 0 if the bit is not set.**
