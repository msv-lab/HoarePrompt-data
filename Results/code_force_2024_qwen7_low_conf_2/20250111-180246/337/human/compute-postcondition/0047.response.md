Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `a`, a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 5000. It calculates the sum of the maximum values for each possible non-empty subset of the list `a`, then returns this sum modulo 998244353.**

**Specifically, the function iterates over all possible subsets of `a` using a bitmask approach. For each subset, it finds the maximum value among the elements of that subset and adds it to `total_value`. The final `total_value` is computed modulo 998244353.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 1, as there is only one non-empty subset.
- The function correctly handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.
- The function correctly handles the case where `a` contains duplicate values.
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0. Since the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 5000`, this edge case is not relevant here. However, if the function were to be extended to include `n = 0`, it would need to return 0, as there are no non-empty subsets.

**Final State of the Program:**
- After the function concludes, the program returns `total_value`, which is the sum of the maximum values for each possible non-empty subset of the list `a`, modulo 998244353.
