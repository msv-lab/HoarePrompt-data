The code `max_balls = max(max_balls, a[i])` updates `max_balls` to be the maximum value between its current value and `a[i]`. However, since the initial state does not specify the values of `max_balls` and `a[i]`, let's denote them generically as `max_balls` and `a[i]`.

After executing the code, `max_balls` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`. The variable `a[i]` remains unchanged, and no other variables are affected.

Output State: **`max_balls` is the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`; `a[i]` remains unchanged**
