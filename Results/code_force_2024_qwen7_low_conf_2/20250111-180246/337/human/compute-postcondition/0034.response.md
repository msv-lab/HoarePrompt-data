The code updates the value of `max_balls` by setting it to the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`. Given that the initial value of `max_balls` is 0, and `a[i]` is one of the elements in the list `a`, the value of `max_balls` will be updated to the maximum value between 0 and `a[i]`. Since `a[i]` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 5000, the new value of `max_balls` will be `a[i]`.

All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total_value` is 0, `mask` is \(2^n - 2\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `max_balls` is `a[i]`, and the current value of `(mask & 1 << i)` is not 0.**
