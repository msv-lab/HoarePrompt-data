The initial state is defined as follows:
- `total_value` is \((2 \times \text{max\_balls}) \% \text{MOD}\)
- `mask` is \(2^n - 2\)
- `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
- `i` is \(n - 1\)
- `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
- `max_balls` is the maximum value among all elements in `a`

The code snippet is:
```python
max_balls = 0
```

This line of code sets `max_balls` to 0. It does not affect the values of `total_value`, `mask`, `n`, `i`, or `a`.

Output State: **`total_value` is \((2 \times 0) \% \text{MOD} = 0\), `mask` is \(2^n - 2\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `max_balls` is 0**
