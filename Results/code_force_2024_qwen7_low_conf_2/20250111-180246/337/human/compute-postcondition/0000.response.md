The code snippet initializes the constant `MOD` with the value `998244353`. This assignment does not affect the values of `n` or the list `a`. Therefore, the only information that changes is the introduction of the new constant `MOD`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 5000, and `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies 1 <= a_i <= 5000; `MOD` is 998244353**
