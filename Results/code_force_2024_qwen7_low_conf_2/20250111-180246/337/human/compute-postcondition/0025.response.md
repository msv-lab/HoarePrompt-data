Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States**:
   - `total_value` is \((0 + a[0]) \% \text{MOD}\)
   - `mask` is \(2^{\text{current\_iteration}}\)
   - `n` is greater than 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `max_balls` is the maximum of its initial value and `a[1]`

2. **Loop Condition**:
   The loop condition is `for i in range(n)`, which means the loop will run as long as `i < n`.

3. **Current Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.
   - Given that `i` starts at 2 and `n` is greater than 0, for the loop to continue, `i` needs to increment by 1.

4. **State Adjustments**:
   - After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 3.
   - The other states (`total_value`, `mask`, `n`, and `max_balls`) remain unchanged as per the problem statement.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration are:
- `total_value` remains the same: \((0 + a[0]) \% \text{MOD}\)
- `mask` remains the same: \(2^{\text{current\_iteration}}\)
- `n` remains the same: greater than 0
- `i` becomes 3: `i` is 3
- `max_balls` remains the same: the maximum of its initial value and `a[1]`

**Final State:**
State: **`total_value` is \((0 + a[0]) \% \text{MOD}\), `mask` is \(2^{\text{current\_iteration}}\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `max_balls` is the maximum of its initial value and `a[1]`**
