Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `total_value` is \((0 + \text{max\_balls}) \% \text{MOD}\)
   - \(n\) is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\)
   - `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\)
   - `mask` is an integer
   - `max_balls` is the maximum value among the elements of `a` for which the corresponding bit in `mask` was set

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for mask in range(1 << n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Understanding the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over all possible values of `mask` from `0` to \(2^n - 1\). This means it will iterate \(2^n\) times in total.
   - The loop will stop once `mask` reaches \(2^n\).

4. **Current Value of `mask`:**
   - Since the loop starts from `0` and increments `mask` by `1` each iteration, at the end of the previous iteration, `mask` is \(2^{\text{current\_iteration}} - 1\).

5. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `mask` will be incremented to \(2^{\text{current\_iteration}}\).
   - The loop will continue as long as `mask < 2^n`.

6. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The value of `total_value` does not change based on the loop itself but will be updated inside the loop body.
   - The value of `mask` will be incremented to the next value in the sequence, which is \(2^{\text{current\_iteration}}\).

Given the above analysis:

- The value of `total_value` remains the same as it is updated inside the loop body.
- The value of `mask` will be \(2^{\text{current\_iteration}}\).
- The value of `n` remains the same.
- The value of `a` remains the same.
- The value of `max_balls` remains the same as it is determined by the current `mask` and does not change with the loop.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`total_value` is \((0 + \text{max\_balls}) \% \text{MOD}\), `mask` is \(2^{\text{current\_iteration}}\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), and `max_balls` is the maximum value among the elements of `a` for which the corresponding bit in `mask` was set.**

Note: The exact value of `2^{\text{current\_iteration}}` cannot be determined without knowing the number of iterations completed so far, but it is represented as such in the state.
