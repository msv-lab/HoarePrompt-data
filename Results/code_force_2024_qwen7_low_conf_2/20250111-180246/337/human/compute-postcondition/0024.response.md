Postcondition: ***`total_value` is \((0 + a[0]) \% \text{MOD}\), `mask` is \(2^{\text{current\_iteration}}\), `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `max_balls` is the maximum of its initial value and `a[1]`. Since there is no else part, the `total_value`, `mask`, `n`, `i`, and `max_balls` remain unchanged from their respective values after evaluating the if condition.***
