The code snippet `max_balls = max(max_balls, a[i])` updates the value of `max_balls` to be the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, the value of `a[i]` is `a[n]`. Since `max_balls` is initially 0, the new value of `max_balls` will be `a[n]` because `a[n]` is the only value being compared to `max_balls`.

Output State: **`total_value` is 0, `mask` is \(2^n - 2\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is \(n\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), and `max_balls` is `a[n]`.**
