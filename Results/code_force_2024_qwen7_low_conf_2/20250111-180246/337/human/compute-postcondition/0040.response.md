`max_balls` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `a[i]`. Given that `i = n - 1`, the bit at position `i` in `mask` (which is \(2^n - 2\)) is set because \(2^{(n-1)}\) is part of \(2^n - 2\). Therefore, `max_balls` will take the value of `a[i]` if `a[i]` is greater than the current value of `max_balls`.

Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `a[i]`, we know that `max_balls` will be updated to `a[n-1]` if `a[n-1]` is greater than the initial value of `max_balls`, which is 0. Thus, the updated value of `max_balls` is `a[n-1]`.

Output State: **`total_value` is 0, `mask` is \(2^n - 2\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is \(n-1\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), and `max_balls` is `a[n-1]`.**
