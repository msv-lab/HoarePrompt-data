Output State: **`total_value` is \((0 + \text{max\_balls}) \% \text{MOD}\), `mask` is \(2^n - 1\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), and `max_balls` is the maximum value among all elements in `a`.**

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - `total_value` starts as \((0 + \text{max\_balls}) \% \text{MOD}\). Initially, since `max_balls` is 0, `total_value` is \((0 + 0) \% \text{MOD} = 0\).
   - `mask` starts as \(2^{\text{current\_iteration}}\), which means `mask` will be updated to cover all bits from 0 to \(n-1\) as the loop progresses.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
   - `max_balls` is initialized to 0.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `a`.
   - For each index `i` from 0 to \(n-1\), the loop checks if the `i`-th bit of `mask` is set using the condition `mask & 1 << i`.
   - If the condition is true, `max_balls` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[i]`.

3. **Final State After All Iterations:**
   - By the end of the loop, `mask` will have all bits set to 1, i.e., `mask` will be \(2^n - 1\).
   - The loop will have processed all elements in `a`, updating `max_balls` to be the maximum value among all elements in `a`.
   - `total_value` will be \((0 + \text{max\_balls}) \% \text{MOD}\).

Thus, after the loop completes, `total_value` will be \((0 + \text{max\_balls}) \% \text{MOD}\), `mask` will be \(2^n - 1\), and `max_balls` will be the maximum value among all elements in `a`.
