Postcondition: ***`total_value` is 0, `mask` is \(2^n - 2\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), and `max_balls` is `a[i]` if and only if the condition `mask & 1 << i` is not 0. Otherwise, `max_balls` remains 0.***
