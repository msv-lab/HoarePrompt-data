Postcondition: **`total_value` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies 1 <= `a_i` <= 5000, `mask` is 0, `max_balls` remains unchanged (i.e., the maximum value in the list `a` as per the precondition), and the condition `(mask & 1 << i)` is not satisfied.**
