Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `total_value` is 0.
   - `mask` is \(2^n - 2\).
   - `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\).
   - `i` is \(n - 1\).
   - `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\).
   - `max_balls` is `a[i]` if and only if the condition `mask & 1 << i` is not 0. Otherwise, `max_balls` remains 0.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to \(n-1\). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and checked against `n`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` was \(n - 1\).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should become \(n\).

4. **Adjusting Other Variables:**
   - Since `i` becomes \(n\), we check the mask condition again for the new value of `i`.
   - The mask remains \(2^n - 2\).
   - `n` stays the same.
   - `a` remains unchanged.
   - `max_balls` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is \(n\)).

5. **Mask Condition for New `i`:**
   - The condition `mask & 1 << i` checks the \(i\)-th bit of `mask`.
   - For `i = n`, the bit position would be \(n\), but since `n` is the upper limit, this bit is beyond the defined range and always 0.
   - Therefore, `max_balls` will remain 0.

Given these steps, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`total_value` is 0, `mask` is \(2^n - 2\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is \(n\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), and `max_balls` is 0.**
