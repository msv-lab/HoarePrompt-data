Postcondition: ***`total_value` remains 0, `i` is increased by 1, `a` is a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i <= 5000`, `mask` is 0, and `max_balls` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `a[i]` if `(mask & 1 << i)` is true. Otherwise, `i` is increased by 1 and `max_balls` remains unchanged.***
