According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `mask`. The loop iterates over all possible values of `mask` from `0` to \((2^n) - 1\). At the end of the previous iteration, `total_value` is \((2 \times \text{max\_balls}) \% \text{MOD}\), `mask` is \(2^n - 1\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), and `max_balls` is the maximum value among all elements in `a`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `mask` needs to take the next value in the sequence, which is `2^n - 2`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop will be:

State: **`total_value` is \((2 \times \text{max\_balls}) \% \text{MOD}\), `mask` is \(2^n - 2\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `i` is \(n - 1\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `max_balls` is the maximum value among all elements in `a`**
