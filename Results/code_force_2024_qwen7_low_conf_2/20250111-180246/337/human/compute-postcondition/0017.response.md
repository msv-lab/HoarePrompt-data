The code sets `max_balls` to 0. This means the value of `max_balls` is explicitly set to 0, and no other variables are affected. The initial conditions for `total_value`, `mask`, `n`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_value` is \((0 + \text{max\_balls}) \% \text{MOD}\), `mask` is \(2^{\text{current\_iteration}}\), `n` is a non-negative integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\), `a` is a list of \(n\) integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 5000\), `max_balls` is 0**
