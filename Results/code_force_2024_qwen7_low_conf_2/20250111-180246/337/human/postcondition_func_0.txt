- The function correctly handles the case where `n` is 1, as there is only one non-empty subset.
- The function correctly handles the case where all elements in `a` are the same.
- The function correctly handles the case where `a` contains duplicate values.
- The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0. Since the problem statement specifies that `1 ≤ n ≤ 5000`, this edge case is not relevant here. However, if the function were to be extended to include `n = 0`, it would need to return 0, as there are no non-empty subsets.
