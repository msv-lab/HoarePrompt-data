The function `func` accepts a matrix of characters representing transitions between scenarios, where each line contains `n` characters and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The characters can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?', or '.' (no transition video yet decided). At most 2⌊n/2⌋ characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'. The function processes this input to determine if certain conditions are met and constructs a new matrix of characters based on these conditions.
