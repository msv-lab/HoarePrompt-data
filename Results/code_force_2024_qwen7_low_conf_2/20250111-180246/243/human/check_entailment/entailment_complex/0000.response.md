Reasoning:
1. **Initial Input Handling**: The function correctly handles the initial input, storing it in a list of strings `xx`. This ensures that the input matrix is preserved for further processing.

2. **Counting F and S Transitions**: The function counts the occurrences of 'F' and 'S' for each scenario, storing these counts in lists `a` and `b`. This step is crucial for determining which scenarios have more 'F' or 'S' transitions already decided.

3. **Determining Initial Lists `sa` and `sb`**: The function correctly identifies indices of scenarios that have only 'F' or only 'S' transitions decided. These are stored in lists `sa` and `sb` respectively. This helps in deciding how to fill in undecided transitions ('?').

4. **Balancing Decisions**: The function decides whether to fill more 'F' or 'S' based on the lengths of `sa` and `sb`. If `|sa| >= |sb|`, it prioritizes filling more 'F'. Conversely, if `|sa| < |sb|`, it prioritizes filling more 'S'. This ensures that the distribution of 'F' and 'S' is balanced across the scenarios.

5. **Constructing the Output Matrix**: For each undecided transition ('?'), the function checks if the indices of the current scenario and destination scenario fall within the first quarter of `sa` or `sb` (depending on the condition). This check ensures that the transition video does not exceed the allowed consecutive limit of `⌈3n/4⌉`.

6. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where `sa` and `sb` might be empty or the matrix dimensions are small (2 ≤ n ≤ 24).

Given that the function logically follows the problem statement and correctly balances the distribution of 'F' and 'S' transitions while adhering to the constraints, the program appears to be correct.

Correctness: **True**
