Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not correctly solve the problem described. Here's why:

1. **Objective**: The problem requires ensuring that no matter the order of scenarios, no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type occur. The program does not explicitly check this constraint and instead attempts to fill in undecided transition videos ('?') with either 'F' or 'S'.

2. **Logic and Implementation**:
   - The program initializes counts (`a` and `b`) to keep track of the total number of 'F' and 'S' in each position across all input strings.
   - It identifies positions with only 'F' or only 'S' and stores these indices in `sa` and `sb`.
   - Based on the size of `sa` and `sb`, it decides whether to prefer 'F' or 'S' for undecided positions ('?').
   - However, this logic does not ensure that the resulting arrangement will satisfy the constraint about consecutive videos of the same type.

3. **Flawed Assumption**: The program assumes that by assigning 'F' or 'S' to undecided positions based on the sizes of `sa` and `sb`, the final arrangement will meet the required constraint. This is not guaranteed because:
   - It does not account for the overall distribution of 'F' and 'S' across all transition pairs.
   - It does not perform a deeper analysis of sequences to ensure no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S' appear.

4. **Example Counter-Case**:
   Consider a small example with \( n = 4 \):
   ```
   .??
   ?..
   ??.?
   ?...
   ```
   The program might assign:
   - `sa = [1]` and `sb = [2, 3]` (assuming the counts and positions are tracked accordingly).
   - Then it fills the '?' with 'F' or 'S' based on the size comparison, leading to an invalid arrangement like:
     ```
     FFF.
     F.FF
     FF.F
     FFFF
     ```
   In this case, starting from the second scenario to the third, we have four consecutive 'F', which violates the constraint.

To correctly solve this problem, the program would need to implement a more sophisticated algorithm to ensure that any permutation of scenarios results in no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive 'F' or 'S'. This likely involves a more detailed combinatorial or graph-based approach to balance the distribution of 'F' and 'S' and validate the resulting arrangement against the constraint.
