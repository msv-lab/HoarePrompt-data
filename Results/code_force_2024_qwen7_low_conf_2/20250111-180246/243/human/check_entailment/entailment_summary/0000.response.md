Reasoning:
1. The problem requires ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type occur for any permutation of scenarios.
2. The program attempts to fill in the undecided ('?') transition videos while respecting the given constraints.
3. However, the logic in the provided code does not correctly ensure the constraint about consecutive transition videos of the same type. Here are some key issues:
   - The code incorrectly handles the distribution of 'F' and 'S' types. It tries to decide the types based on a simplistic rule without ensuring the global constraint.
   - The logic for deciding the type of undecided transition videos is flawed. It only checks if a scenario is among the first \(n//4 - 1\) in the list, which does not guarantee the required constraint.
   - There's no proper algorithmic approach to ensure the constraint is met across all permutations of scenarios.

Given these issues, the provided code does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
