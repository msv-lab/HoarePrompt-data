### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The task is to create a transition video plan for a game with \( n \) scenarios, ensuring that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown for any permutation of scenarios.

2. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The program reads the input and counts the number of F and S transitions for each scenario.
   - It categorizes scenarios into `sa` (with more F transitions) and `sb` (with more S transitions).
   - Based on the sizes of `sa` and `sb`, it fills in the remaining `?` values to ensure the constraint is met.
   - The logic seems to handle the problem as specified, ensuring the constraints are satisfied.

3. **Annotated Code Analysis**:
   - The program correctly initializes the necessary variables and reads the input.
   - It counts the number of F and S transitions for each scenario, storing these counts in arrays `a` and `b`.
   - It categorizes scenarios into `sa` and `sb` based on the counts of F and S transitions.
   - The program then decides how to fill in the remaining `?` values based on the sizes of `sa` and `sb`.

However, there are several issues with the program's logic and implementation:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Unallocated Scenarios**:
   - The program appends unallocated scenarios (where both `a[i]` and `b[i]` are zero) to `sa` in the case where `len(sa) >= len(sb)`. This is incorrect because the unallocated scenarios should be placed in `sb` to balance the distribution of F and S transitions.

2. **Incorrect Decision-Making for `?` Values**:
   - In the case where `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, the program appends 'F' to `nx` if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`. This logic is flawed because it does not account for the need to balance the distribution of F and S transitions across all permutations of scenarios.
   - Similarly, in the case where `len(sa) < len(sb)`, the program appends 'S' to `nx` if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`. Again, this logic is incomplete and does not ensure the constraint is met for all permutations.

3. **Lack of Consistency**:
   - The program does not ensure that the final output satisfies the constraint for all permutations of scenarios. The logic for filling in the `?` values is not consistent and may lead to invalid outputs.

### Final Evaluation:
Based on the detailed analysis, the program does not correctly implement the required logic to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive videos of the same type are shown for any permutation of scenarios. The annotated code and the original assessment highlight these issues, and the provided examples demonstrate cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

**Final: False**
