Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly handle the requirement that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type should be seen, regardless of the order of scenarios. 

Let's analyze a specific case to demonstrate this:

### Case Analysis:
Consider the input for \(n = 5\):

```
. ? F ? ?
. . ? ? ?
F . ? S ?
? ? S . ?
? ? ? ? .
```

According to the problem description, the program should ensure that no more than 4 consecutive transition videos of the same type are seen in any permutation of scenarios.

However, the current implementation has several issues:
1. **Incorrect Calculation of `sa` and `sb`:**
   - The logic for determining `sa` and `sb` (arrays storing indices of scenarios with more funny or scary transitions) is flawed. The program does not properly account for the remaining undecided (`?`) values and their impact on the final count of consecutive videos.

2. **Incorrect Assignment of Values:**
   - The program tries to assign values to undecided (`?`) positions based on some heuristic but does not guarantee that the condition \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) is met for all permutations.

### Example of Failure:
For the given input, let's consider the permutation \(1, 2, 3, 4, 5\):

- Transition video sequence would be: `F ? F ? ?`
- If the first `?` in the sequence is assigned 'F', the sequence becomes `F F F ? ?`
- This results in 3 consecutive 'F' videos, which is fine.
- However, if the last two `?` are also assigned 'F', the sequence becomes `F F F F F`, which violates the requirement of having no more than 4 consecutive videos of the same type.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly handle the constraints and fails to ensure that no more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) consecutive transition videos of the same type are seen for all permutations of scenarios. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
