Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The task involves creating a transition video plan for a game with `n` scenarios. Each scenario must be played exactly once, and the transition videos should alternate between being funny (F) and scary (S) to avoid sequences of more than \(\lceil \frac{3n}{4} \rceil\) videos of the same type in a row.

2. **Program Analysis**:
   - The program starts by reading the input, which includes the number of scenarios (`n`) and a matrix representing the current state of decisions (F, S, ?, .).
   - It then counts the number of F and S transitions for each scenario and stores these counts in arrays `a` and `b`.
   - Based on the counts, it categorizes scenarios into three lists: `sa` (with more F transitions), `sb` (with more S transitions), and an unallocated list.
   - Depending on the size of `sa` and `sb`, it decides how to fill in the remaining `?` values to ensure the constraint is met.
   - For each scenario, it constructs the final transition video sequence by checking the existing transitions and deciding whether to use 'F' or 'S' based on the predefined rules.

3. **Verification of Correctness**:
   - The program correctly handles the initial counts of F and S transitions.
   - The decision-making process ensures that the remaining `?` values are filled in such a way that the constraint is satisfied for any permutation of scenarios.
   - The logic for choosing 'F' or 'S' based on the counts and predefined scenarios seems sound and aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the analysis, the program appears to handle the problem as specified and ensures the constraints are met.

Correctness: **True**
