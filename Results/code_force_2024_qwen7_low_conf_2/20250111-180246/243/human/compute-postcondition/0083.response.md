The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1, where `j` is 5. Given the initial state, `b[5]` is incremented by 1. Since `b` is a list of length `n + 2`, the value of `b[5]` was previously `b[5]`, and now it is `b[5] + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1); `j` is 5; `x` is an input string; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2`; `b` is a list of length `n + 2` and `b[5]` is incremented by 1.**
