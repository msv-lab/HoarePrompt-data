`nx` is initially a string with no value specified, but it is being updated by appending 'S' to it. Since no initial value for `nx` is given, we assume it is an empty string. After executing `nx += 'S'`, `nx` will be `'S'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, `nx` is `'S'`.

Output State: **`j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, `nx` is `'S'`**.
