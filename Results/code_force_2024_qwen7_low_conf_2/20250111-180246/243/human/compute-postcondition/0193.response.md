The code snippet `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` impacts the `nx` variable by appending the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the end of `nx`. The value of `j` is incremented by 1 (though this increment is not directly used in the assignment), and the values of `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]` are referenced but not altered.

Given the initial state where `nx` is a string constructed based on certain rules, `j` is `j + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]` are the values to be checked for constructing the next segment of `nx`, the code appends `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`.

Output State: **`nx` is now the original `nx` plus the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `j` is `j + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]` are unchanged.**
