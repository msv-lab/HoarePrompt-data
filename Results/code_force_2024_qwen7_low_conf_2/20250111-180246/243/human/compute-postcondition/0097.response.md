Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']` and for `k` from `1` to `n`, `xx[k]` is the `k`-th input string, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `sa` is an empty list since `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] > 0`, and `sb` is `[1]` if `b[i] > 0` and `a[i] == 0`, otherwise `sb` remains an empty list.***
