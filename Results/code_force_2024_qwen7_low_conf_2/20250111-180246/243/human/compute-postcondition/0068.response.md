The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1. The value of `i` is not explicitly defined in the snippet, but given the context, it's implied that `i` is a variable within the range from 1 to `n + 1`. Since the exact value of `i` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `b[i]` after the increment, but we know that `b[i]` will be increased by 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1), `j` starts at 1 and goes up to n + 1, `x` is an input string, `xx[0]` is [''], `xx[1]` is `x`, `xx[2]` is `x`, `a` is a list of length `n + 2`, `b` is a list of length `n + 2`, `x[j - 1]` is not equal to 'F', and `x[j - 1]` is 'S'; `b[i]` is increased by 1.**
