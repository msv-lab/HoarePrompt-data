Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `i` is `n`, `n` must be a positive integer, `nx` is a string constructed based on the following rules: for each iteration, if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then append `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, append 'F' to `nx`. Otherwise, append 'S' to `nx`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**: The initial state sets `j` to `n + 1`, indicating that `j` starts just beyond the end of the range it iterates over (`1` to `n`). `i` is set to be within the range `[1, n]`, and `nx` is initialized as an empty string.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs for each value of `j` from `1` to `n`.
   - For each iteration, `nx` is updated based on the condition inside the `if-elif-else` block.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` is appended with the character `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, and either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`), `nx` is appended with 'F'.
   - If neither condition is met, `nx` is appended with 'S'.

3. **Final State After All Iterations**:
   - Since the loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`, it will iterate exactly `n` times.
   - After `n` iterations, `j` will be `n + 1` (just beyond the end of the loop).
   - `i` will also be `n` because the loop modifies `i` within its range, but since the loop condition is based on `j`, `i` remains `n` at the end.
   - `nx` will contain the concatenation of characters based on the conditions described above, with the final value being the result of all iterations.

### Special Case When Loop Does Not Execute:
- If `n` is `0`, the loop will not execute at all, so `j` will still be `1` (or any value that was set initially, but typically it would be `n + 1`), `i` will remain within the range `[1, 0]` which is invalid, and `nx` will still be an empty string. However, in practice, the loop condition would ensure that `i` is within a valid range, so this scenario is less likely unless `n` is explicitly set to `0`.

Thus, the final output state is as described.
