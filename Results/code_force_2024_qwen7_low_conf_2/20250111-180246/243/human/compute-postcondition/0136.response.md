`nx` is assigned the value of itself plus the string `'F'`. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `nx`, it remains unspecified except for the fact that it gets appended with the string `'F'`. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `i`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is equal to its original value plus the string `'F'`.**
