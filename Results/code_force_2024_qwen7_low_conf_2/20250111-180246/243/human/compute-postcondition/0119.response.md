`sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `sa`. Since `i` is 3, the list `sa` will now contain the value 3. The value of `i` itself does not change. The states of the other variables (`n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sb`, and `t`) remain unchanged, and the conditions `a[2] == 0` and `b[2] == 0` must still be false.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa` is [3], `sb`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the condition `a[2] == 0` and `b[2] == 0` must be false.**
