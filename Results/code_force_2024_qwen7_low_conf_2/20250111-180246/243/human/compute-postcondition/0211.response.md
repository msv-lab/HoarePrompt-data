Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1`, `sa` and `sb` are lists, and `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true. If `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, then `sb` is updated to include the additional element 3. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
