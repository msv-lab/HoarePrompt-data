Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `i` is within the range [1, n]. If `xx[i][1]` is not '?', then `nx` is increased by `xx[i][1]`. Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is within the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is equal to its original value plus the string `'F'`. Otherwise, `nx` is a string ending with 'S'.***
