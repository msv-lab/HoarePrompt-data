`b[j]` is assigned the value of `b[j] + 1`. Since `j` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`, `b[j]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`, and `x[j - 1]` is 'S'; `b[i]` is increased by 1; `b[j]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is in the range `[1, n + 1)`, and `x[j - 1]` is 'S'; `b[i]` is increased by 1; `b[j]` is increased by 1.**
