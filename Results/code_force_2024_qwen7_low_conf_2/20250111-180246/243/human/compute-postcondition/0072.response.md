Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1).
   - `j` is a value from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - `x` is an input string.
   - `xx[0]` is `['']`.
   - `xx[1]` is `x`.
   - `xx[2]` is `x`.
   - `a` is a list of length `n + 2`.
   - `b` is a list of length `n + 2`.
   - If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is increased by 1.
   - If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is increased by 1.
   - Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Current Iteration End State**:
   - The loop is currently iterating over `j` from 1 to `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` would be `k`, where `k` is the last value of `j` that was processed before the current iteration.

4. **Next Iteration Start State**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1 from its previous value `k` to `k + 1`.
   - Therefore, `j` will be `k + 1`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `k + 1`.
   - The values of `n`, `x`, `xx`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged unless explicitly modified within the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes were made to these variables.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
- `n` remains the same.
- `j` is now `k + 1`, where `k` was the value of `j` at the end of the previous iteration.
- `x`, `xx`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Given that `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, the next value of `j` will be `2` if it was `1` at the end of the previous iteration, and so on.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1); `j` is a value from 1 to `n + 1`; `x` is an input string; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2`; `b` is a list of length `n + 2`; `j` is increased by 1 from its previous value.**

If we denote the previous value of `j` as `k`, then the new value of `j` is `k + 1`.

So, the final state can be summarized as:
State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1); `j` is a value from 1 to `n + 1`; `x` is an input string; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2`; `b` is a list of length `n + 2`; `j` is increased by 1 from its previous value.**

To provide a specific example based on the previous value of `j`:
- If the previous value of `j` was `3`, then the new value of `j` is `4`.
- State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1); `j` is a value from 1 to `n + 1`; `x` is an input string; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1] is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2`; `b` is a list of length `n + 2`; `j` is 4.**
