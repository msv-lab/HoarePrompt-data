`nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `j` is 2, `j - 1` equals 1. Therefore, `nx` is incremented by the value of `xx[i][1]`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is increased by `xx[i][1]`**
