The function `func` accepts a parameter that consists of `n` lines, where `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. Each line contains `n` characters representing transitions between scenarios. The characters can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?', or '.' (no transition video yet decided). At most 2⌊n/2⌋ characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'. 

Case_1: The function returns the input matrix as it is if all the conditions are met.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a matrix of characters based on specified constraints and return the same matrix if all conditions are satisfied.
