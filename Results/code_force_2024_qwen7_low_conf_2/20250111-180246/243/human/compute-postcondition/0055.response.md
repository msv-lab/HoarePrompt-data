The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` is 1, `b[j]` is effectively `b[1]`. Since the initial state does not specify what `b` is, we can only state that `b[1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `x[0]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `x[0]` equals either 'F' or 'S', `b[1]` is increased by 1**
