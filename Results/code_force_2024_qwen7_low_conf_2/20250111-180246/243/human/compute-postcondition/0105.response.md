Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 4, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']` and for `k` from `1` to `n`, `xx[k]` is the `k`-th input string, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `sa` is `[3, 4]`, and `sb` is `[3]` if `b[3] > 0` and `a[3] == 0`, and otherwise, `sb` retains its initial state.***

Explanation: The if part sets `sa` to `[3, 4]` under the condition that `a[i] > 0` and `b[i] == 0`. Since `i` is fixed as 4, this means `sa` becomes `[3, 4]` if these conditions are met. The else part does not change anything, so `sb` remains in its initial state unless `b[3] > 0` and `a[3] == 0`, in which case it would become `[3]`. All other variables (`n`, `i`, `xx`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.
