Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is within the range \([1, n]\), `n` must be greater than 0. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated by adding `xx[i][j - 1]` to its previous value. Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of the list `sa` (i.e., `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`), then `nx` is `'F'`. Otherwise, `nx` is `nx_prev + 'S'`.***
