`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equivalent to `xx[2][0]`, which is `['']`. So, `nx` becomes `nx + ['']`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, concatenating it with `['']` results in `['']`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is `['']`.**
