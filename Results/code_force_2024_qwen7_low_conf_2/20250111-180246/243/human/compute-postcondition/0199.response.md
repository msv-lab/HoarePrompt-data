The code `print(nx)` simply prints the value of `nx`. Since no new assignment or modification is performed on `nx`, the value of `nx` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`nx` is a string where each character is determined by the rules: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` is concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
