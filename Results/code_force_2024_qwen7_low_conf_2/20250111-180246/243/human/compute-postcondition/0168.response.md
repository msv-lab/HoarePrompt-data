The code snippet `nx += 'F'` tries to append the character 'F' to the variable `nx`. However, in the initial state, there is no variable named `nx` defined. Since `nx` is not defined, attempting to append to it will raise a NameError. Given the constraints of the problem, we assume that the intention was to append 'F' to a variable that exists in the initial state.

Since `nx` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot proceed with the operation. However, if we hypothetically define `nx` as an empty string (which is a common default assumption in such cases), then `nx` would become `'F'`.

Given the initial conditions, the only affected variable is `nx`, which is now set to `'F'`. All other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is within the range \([1, n]\), `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `nx` is 'F'**
