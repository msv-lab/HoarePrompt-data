`a[j]` is assigned the value of `a[j] + 1`. Since `a[i]` was increased by 1 previously, its new value is `a[i] + 1`. The value of `x[j-1]` remains 'F', and `n` remains a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `x[j-1]` is 'F', `a[i]` is increased by 1, and `a[j]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x[j-1]` is 'F', `a[i]` is increased by 1, and `a[j]` is increased by 1**
