`sb` is appended with the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 1 based on the initial state. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state includes `sb` having the value `[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1`, `sa` and `sb` are empty lists with `sb` now containing `[1]`, and `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true. The current value of `a[i]` is 0 and the current value of `b[i]` is 0.**
