Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `i` is `n + 1`.
   - `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0] = ['']`.
   - For `k` from `1` to `n`, `xx[k]` is the `k`-th input string.
   - `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings.
   - `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings.
   - `sa` is a list of all indices `i` from `1` to `n` for which `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
   - `t` is the length of `sa`.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
   - Therefore, the loop will only execute if `1 <= i <= n`.

3. **State Adjustment:**
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`, `i` must be within this range.
   - Given that `i` is initially set to `n + 1`, we need to adjust `i` to be within the range `[1, n]`.
   - We need to ensure that `n` is a positive integer and that there is at least one value of `i` (from `1` to `n`) such that the loop condition is satisfied.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - To ensure the loop can execute, `i` must be adjusted to be within the range `[1, n]`.
   - This means we need to set `i` to be at least `1` and no more than `n`.

Therefore, the state adjustments required for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`i` is within the range `[1, n]`, `n` is a positive integer, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0] = ['']`, for `k` from `1` to `n`, `xx[k]` is the `k`-th input string, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `sa` is a list of all indices `i` from `1` to `n` for which `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`, and `t` is the length of `sa`.**
