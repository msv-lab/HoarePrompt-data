`nx` is a string that is appended with the character 'F', so the length of `nx` increases by 1. The values of `j` and the elements `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]` are not directly affected by this operation, so they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is a string ending with 'F', `j` is `j + 1`, `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]` are unchanged**
