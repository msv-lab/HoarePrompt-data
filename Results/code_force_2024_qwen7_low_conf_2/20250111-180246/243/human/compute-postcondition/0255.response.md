Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`. Depending on whether `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, `nx` is either `'SS'`, `'FS'`, or `['S']` if the condition is true, or `'SF'`, `'FF'`, or `['F']` if the condition is false.***
