`sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 1) to the list `sa`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the other variables (`xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, and `t`) are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa` is `[1]`, `sb`, and `t` remain as they are.**
