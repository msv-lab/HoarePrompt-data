Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `i` is `n + 1`; `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']` and `xx[k]` (for `k` from `1` to `n`) is the `k`-th input string; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings.**

Explanation:
- The loop runs from `i = 1` to `n + 1`. After `n` iterations, `i` becomes `n + 1`.
- The list `xx` accumulates all input strings. Initially, `xx[0]` is `['']` and then each input string `x` is appended to `xx` in each iteration.
- For each input string `x`, the nested loop checks each character `x[j - 1]` and updates the lists `a` and `b` based on whether the character is 'F' or 'S'. Specifically, `a[i]` is incremented by the number of 'F's at position `j-1` across all input strings, and `b[i]` is incremented by the number of 'S's at position `j-1` across all input strings.
- Since the loop runs `n` times, all characters in the input strings are processed, resulting in `a` and `b` containing the total counts of 'F' and 'S' at each position across all input strings.
