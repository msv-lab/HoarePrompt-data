`a[j]` is incremented by 1, where `j` is 4. So, `a[4]` is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1); `j` is 4; `x` is an input string; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2` with `a[4]` incremented by 1; `b` is a list of length `n + 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1); `j` is 4; `x` is an input string; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2` with `a[4]` incremented by 1; `b` is a list of length `n + 2`.**
