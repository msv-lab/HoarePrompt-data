The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. Given the initial state, the value of `nx` could be either a single character (if `xx[i][j]` was not '?' and satisfied certain conditions) or 'F' or 'S' based on the conditions provided. Regardless of the initial value of `nx`, appending 'S' to it changes its value.

Therefore, the updated value of `nx` will be the original value plus 'S'. The states of the other variables (`xx`, `i`, `j`, `sa`, `n`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'; `xx` is a string, `i` is an index, `j` is an index, `sa` is a list, `n` is an integer**
