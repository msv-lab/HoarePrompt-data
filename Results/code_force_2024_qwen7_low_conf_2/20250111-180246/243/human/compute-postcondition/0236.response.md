Postcondition: ***`j` is 3, `n` is a positive integer, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `nx` is either `'S'` or `'F'` or `0`, and `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true.***
