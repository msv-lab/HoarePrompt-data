The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Given the initial conditions, we know that `nx` was previously determined based on the value of `j` (which was 2 in the previous iteration). Now, we need to consider the new value of `j` which is 3.

Since `j` (3) is greater than `n // 4 - 1` (assuming `n` is at least 4), the condition that would modify `nx` to include 'F' based on the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa` does not apply here. Therefore, `nx` retains its previous value unless it was already modified in a previous iteration.

The updated states are:
- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `j` is now 3.
- `i` remains within the range `[1, n]`.
- `nx` retains its previous value unless it was modified in a previous iteration.

Given that the exact previous value of `nx` is not specified, we can only state that it remains unchanged from the previous iteration unless it was modified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 3, `i` is within the range [1, n], and `nx` retains its previous value unless it was modified in a previous iteration.**
