Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, and `t` remain unchanged, and the condition `a[2] == 0` and `b[2] == 0` must still be false. Since the else part does not exist, the condition `a[i] == 0 and b[i] == 0` being true or false does not change the state of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition.***
