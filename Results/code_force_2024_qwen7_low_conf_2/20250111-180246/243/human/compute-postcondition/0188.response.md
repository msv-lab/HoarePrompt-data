`nx` is a string that is updated by appending 'F' to its current value. The initial value of `nx` is either determined by `xx[i][j]` (if `xx[i][j]` is not '?') or 'F' based on the conditions involving `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, and 'S' otherwise. After executing `nx += 'F'`, the new value of `nx` will be the original value of `nx` plus 'F'. The conditions for the initial value of `nx` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'; if `xx[i][j]` is not '?', then `nx` is originally `xx[i][j]`, otherwise, `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S', and now `nx` includes an additional 'F'**.
