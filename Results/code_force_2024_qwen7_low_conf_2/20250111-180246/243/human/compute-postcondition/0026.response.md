The code snippet `b[i] += 1` attempts to increment the value at index `i` of the list `b` by 1. However, there is no list `b` or index `i` defined in the initial state. Since the initial state does not provide any information about `b` or `i`, and these variables are not defined, the code would raise a NameError when executed.

Given the lack of relevant information to proceed with the calculation, the output state cannot be determined accurately based on the provided initial state and the code snippet. Therefore, we need to acknowledge that the code cannot be executed due to missing definitions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 3 and the code raises a NameError because `b` and `i` are not defined.**
