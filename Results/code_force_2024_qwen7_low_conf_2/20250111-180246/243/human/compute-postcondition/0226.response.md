The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` impacts the program by updating the value of `nx`. Let's break it down step by step:

- `j` is 2.
- `n` is a positive integer (unchanged).
- `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`.
- `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values.
- `sa` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n` (unchanged).
- `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true (unchanged).
- `nx` is `'S'` (unchanged).

The code updates `nx` by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to `nx`. Since `j` is 2, we need to determine the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` which is `xx[i][1]`. Given that `xx[0]` is `['']`, and assuming `i` is within the bounds of `xx` (which is `n + 1`), `xx[i][1]` would be an empty string `''` because the first element of each sub-list in `xx` is an empty string.

Therefore, `nx` is updated as follows:
- `nx` was `'S'`.
- Adding an empty string `''` to `'S'` results in `'S' + '' = 'S'`.

So, the value of `nx` remains `'S'`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is `'S'`.**
