Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']` and for `k` from `1` to `n`, `xx[k]` is the `k`-th input string, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `sa` is a list containing all indices `k` where `b[k] > 0` and `a[k] == 0`, and `sb` is a list containing all indices `k` where `a[k] > 0` and `b[k] == 0`.**
