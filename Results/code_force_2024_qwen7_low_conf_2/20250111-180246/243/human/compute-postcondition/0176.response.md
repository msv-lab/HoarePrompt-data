State before the loop starts: `nx` is an empty string.

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `nx` is an empty string, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 0.

State: **`nx` is an empty string, `n` must be greater than 0**
