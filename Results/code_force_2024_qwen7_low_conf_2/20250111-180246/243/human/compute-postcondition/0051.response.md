According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `j` would be `n`, since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `j` is in the range [1, n + 1).
   - If `x[j - 1]` equals 'F', then the value at index `i` of list `a` and the value at index `j` of list `a` are each incremented by 1.
   - If `x[j - 1]` equals 'S', then `b[i]` is incremented by 1 and `b[n + 1]` is incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

2. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `j` is `n`.
   - The condition `j < n + 1` is no longer true because `j` is equal to `n + 1`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented from `n` to `n + 1`.
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the start of each iteration, the next value of `j` will be `n + 1`.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `j` is now `n + 1`, the loop condition `j < n + 1` will evaluate to `False`.
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again unless the range is modified or `j` is reset.

However, based on the given problem, we need to adjust the states such that the loop can continue if it is designed to continue under certain conditions (which is not explicitly stated but implied in the problem setup).

Given the problem context and the fact that `j` has reached `n + 1`, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to continue are as follows:

- `j` must be reset to 1 for the loop to start again.
- `n` must remain the same.
- `x[j - 1]` should still be checked in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, and `x[j - 1]` equals either 'F' or 'S' or remains unchanged.**

So, the final answer is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, and `x[0]` equals either 'F' or 'S' or remains unchanged.**
