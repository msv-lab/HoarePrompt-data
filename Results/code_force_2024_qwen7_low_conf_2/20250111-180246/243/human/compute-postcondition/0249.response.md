Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is either `'S'` or `'F'`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is either `'?'` or not `'?'` depending on whether `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` excluding the last element or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb` excluding the last element.**
