Postcondition: ***`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`. If either `i` or `j` is in the first `n//4 - 1` elements of `sb`, a `NameError` is raised due to the undefined variable `nx`. Otherwise, `nx` is set to `'F'`.***
