`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` plus the string `'F'`. Initially, `nx` is an empty string, so after adding `'F'`, `nx` becomes `'F'`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is `'F'`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'` or `i` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**.
