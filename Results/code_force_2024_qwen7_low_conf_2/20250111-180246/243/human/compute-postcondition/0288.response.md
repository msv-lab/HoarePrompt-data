Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `j` is 3, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`. If `xx[3][2] != '?'`, then `nx` is `val`. Otherwise, `nx` is either `'S'` or `'F'` depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`. The condition `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true.***
