The code snippet `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Initially, `nx` is an empty string. After appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'S'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is 'S'.**
