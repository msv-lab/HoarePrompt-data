Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and if `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is either `'valS'`, `'SS'`, or `'FS'`; otherwise, `nx` is either `val + 'F'`, `'SF'`, or `'FF'`.**
