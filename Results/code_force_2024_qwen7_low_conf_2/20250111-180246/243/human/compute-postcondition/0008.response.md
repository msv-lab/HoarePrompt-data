`a[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x[j-1]` remains 'F', and the value of `n` remains a positive integer. The exact value of `a[i]` cannot be determined without knowing its original value, but it is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `x[j-1]` is 'F', `a[i]` is increased by 1**
