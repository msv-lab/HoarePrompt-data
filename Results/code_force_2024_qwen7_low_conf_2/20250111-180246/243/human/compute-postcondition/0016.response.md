To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions under which the loop continues and what changes occur within the loop.

Given:
- The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n`.
- The loop body is omitted, but we know that it processes `x[j - 1]` and updates arrays `a` and `b` based on the value of `x[j - 1]`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- The loop just finished processing some element of `x`, specifically `x[j - 1]` where `j` was the last processed index (which means `j = n` at this point).

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to `2` (since the loop starts from `1` and goes up to `n`). Therefore, `j` should be set to `2` at the start of the next iteration.

Since the loop condition only depends on `j` (specifically `1 <= j <= n`), and since `n` is already known to be a positive integer, no other state changes are necessary for the loop to continue executing.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2**
