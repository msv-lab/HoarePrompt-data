`a[j]` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` is a positive integer, `j` is in the range [1, n + 1), and `x[j - 1]` is 'F'. The value of `x[j - 1]` remains unchanged, but `a[j]` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is in the range [1, n + 1), `x[j - 1]` is 'F', and `a[j]` is incremented by 1.**
