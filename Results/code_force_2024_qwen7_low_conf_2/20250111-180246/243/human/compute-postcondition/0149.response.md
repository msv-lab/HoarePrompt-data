The code initializes `nx` to an empty string. This does not affect the values of `j`, `i`, `nx`, or the string `xx[i][j-1]`. The output of printing `nx` would be an empty string.

Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is an empty string, and the printed output is an empty string.**
