The code initializes a list `a` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This means that `a` is a list where each element from index 0 to index `n` is 0. The value of `n` remains the same as the integer input provided by the user.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided by the user; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0**
