The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` increments the value of `nx` by the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. The value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, meaning it is a numerical value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is `nx` + `xx[i][j - 1]`, the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**
