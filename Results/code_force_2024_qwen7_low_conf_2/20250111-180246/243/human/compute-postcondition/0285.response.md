The variable `nx` is not defined in the initial state, and the code snippet tries to append 'S' to `nx`. Since `nx` is not defined, it will be initialized as an empty string before the operation. After appending 'S', `nx` will become `'S'`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 3, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, `nx` is `'S'`**
