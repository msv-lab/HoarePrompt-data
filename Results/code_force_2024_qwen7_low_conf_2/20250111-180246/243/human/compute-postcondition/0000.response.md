The code reads an integer `n` from the input, which represents the number of lines in the following input. It then reads `n` lines of input, each containing `n` characters representing the transition videos between scenarios. However, the specific content of these lines is not relevant to determining the output state of the variables after the given code snippet is executed.

The only variable that changes its value is `n`, which is assigned the value of the integer input. All other variables remain in their initial state as no other assignments or changes are made to them in the provided code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided by the user, and the input consists of `n` lines where each line contains `n` characters representing the transition videos between scenarios.**
