The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` is initially an empty string, after appending 'S', `nx` becomes 'S'. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is 'S', `n` must be greater than 0, and (xx[i][j - 1] == '?'), `i` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` and `j` is not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`**
