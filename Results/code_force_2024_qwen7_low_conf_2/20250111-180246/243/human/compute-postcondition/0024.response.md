The code snippet `a[i] += 1` attempts to increment the value at index `i` of the list `a` by 1. However, the variable `a` is not defined in the given initial state, and there is no definition or initialization of `i`. Therefore, this line of code will raise a NameError because `a` is not defined.

Since the code cannot be executed due to a missing definition for `a`, the output state remains unchanged from the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 3**
