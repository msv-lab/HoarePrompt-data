`sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 2) to the list `sb`. Since `sb` originally contains `[1]`, after appending `i`, `sb` will contain `[1, 2]`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1`, `sa` and `sb` are lists with `sb` containing `[1, 2]`, and `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true.**
