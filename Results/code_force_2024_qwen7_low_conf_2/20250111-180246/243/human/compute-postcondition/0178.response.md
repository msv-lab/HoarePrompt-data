`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`. Since `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', it is appended to `nx`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nx` is an empty string plus `xx[i][j - 1]`, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'.

Output State: **`nx` is `xx[i][j - 1]`, `n` is greater than 0, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**
