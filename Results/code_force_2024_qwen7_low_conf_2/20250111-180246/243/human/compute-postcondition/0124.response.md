Let's break down the given problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `i` is within the range `[1, n]`.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0] = ['']`.
   - For `k` from `1` to `n`, `xx[k]` is the `k`-th input string.
   - `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings.
   - `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings.
   - `sa` is a list of all indices `i` from `1` to `n` for which `a[i] == 0` and `b[i] == 0`.
   - `t` is the length of `sa`.
   - `nx` is an empty string.

2. **For Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop is defined as `for j in range(1, n + 1):`
   - This means `j` will iterate from `1` to `n`.

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range `[1, n]`.

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since `j` starts from `1` and goes up to `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is at least `1` for the loop to execute.
   - The value of `j` will be `1` at the start of the first iteration.

5. **Summary of States to Adjust**:
   - Ensure `n` is greater than `0` (which it already is according to the initial state).
   - Set `j` to `1` for the first iteration.

Given these steps, the states that need to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `i` is within the range `[1, n]`**.

This ensures that the loop can start executing with `j` being `1` and `n` being a positive integer.
