According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, the state is as follows:
- `j` is `n + 1`
- `i` is within the range [1, n]
- `nx` contains the concatenated string formed by processing `xx[i][j-1]` according to the specified rules
- `nx` is printed

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1 and it must still be within the range [1, n]. Since `j` is `n + 1`, `i` cannot increase further within this loop.

Therefore, the loop cannot execute one more time because `i` has already reached its upper limit `n`.

State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` contains the concatenated string formed by processing `xx[i][j-1]` according to the specified rules, and `nx` is printed. The loop cannot execute one more time.**
