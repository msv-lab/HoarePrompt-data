`b[j]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Given that `j` is `n + 1`, `b[n + 1]` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `b[i]` is incremented by 1, and `b[n + 1]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `b[i]` is incremented by 1, `b[n + 1]` is incremented by 1**
