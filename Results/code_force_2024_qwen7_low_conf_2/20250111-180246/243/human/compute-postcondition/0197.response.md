Postcondition: ***`nx` is a string constructed based on the rules given, `j` is incremented by 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]` remain unchanged. If either `i` is in the first quarter of `sa` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`, `nx` ends with 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to include the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?') or remains the same (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?').***
