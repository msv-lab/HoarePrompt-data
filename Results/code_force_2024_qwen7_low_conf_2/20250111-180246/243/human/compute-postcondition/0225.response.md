Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is 1.
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values.
   - `sa` is an empty list.
   - `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`.
   - `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true.
   - `nx` is a string that is `'S'` if `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, and `'F'` otherwise.

2. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop runs for `j` in the range `1` to `n + 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1.
   - For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to 2.

3. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 in each iteration, it will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `xx`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.
   - `sa` and `sb` remain unchanged as no additional conditions or operations affecting them were mentioned.
   - The condition `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true because no operations that could change this condition were described.
   - `nx` needs to be recalculated based on the new value of `j` (which is now 2). Since `j` is now 2, it falls within the first quarter of `sb` (which contains indices from 1 to `n`). Therefore, `nx` will be `'S'`.

4. **Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `j` is 2.
   - `n` is a positive integer (unchanged).
   - `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`.
   - `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values.
   - `sa` is an empty list (unchanged).
   - `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n` (unchanged).
   - `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true.
   - `nx` is `'S'`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is `'S'`.**
