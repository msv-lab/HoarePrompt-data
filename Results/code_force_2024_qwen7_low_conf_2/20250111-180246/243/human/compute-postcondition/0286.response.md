The code `nx += 'F'` is intended to append the character 'F' to the string stored in the variable `nx`. However, there is no initial state given for `nx`. Given the context and the typical usage in Python, it's reasonable to assume that `nx` was not initialized before this line of code. Therefore, the assignment `nx += 'F'` initializes `nx` to be the string `'F'`.

Let's go through the step-by-step process:

- `i` is 3 (unchanged).
- `j` is 3 (unchanged).
- `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']` (unchanged).
- `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values (unchanged).
- `sa` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n` (unchanged).
- The condition `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true (unchanged).

The only change is the initialization and subsequent assignment of `nx` to `'F'`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 3, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `nx` is `'F'`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true**
