The code `xx.append(x)` appends the string `x` to the list `xx`. The initial state is defined as follows:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `i` is 1
- `xx[0]` is `['']`
- `xx[1]` is `x`
- `xx[2]` is `x`
- `a` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k` in `x` for `k` from `1` to `n + 1`
- `b` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k` in `x` for `k` from `1` to `n + 1`
- `x` is an input string

After executing `xx.append(x)`, the new value of `xx[3]` will be `x`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `i` is 1; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `xx[3]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k` in `x` for `k` from `1` to `n + 1`; `b` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k` in `x` for `k` from `1` to `n + 1`; `x` is an input string.**
