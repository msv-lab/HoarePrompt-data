To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the current values of the variables and how they change as the loop progresses.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `total` is 10
   - `i` is within the range \([1, n]\)
   - `n` must be greater than 0
   - `nx` is determined based on the conditions provided

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(1, n + 1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from \(j = 1\) to \(j = n\).

4. **Variable Changes During the Loop:**
   - The variable `j` starts at 1 and increments by 1 each iteration until it reaches \(n\).
   - The variable `nx` is set based on the conditions provided but does not change with each iteration of `j`.

5. **Determine the Next State:**
   - Since `j` ranges from 1 to \(n\), the loop will execute \(n\) times.
   - At the end of the previous iteration (when `j` was \(n\)), `j` will be incremented to \(n+1\).
   - Therefore, the loop will not execute again because `j` will now be \(n+1\), which is out of the range \([1, n]\).

6. **State Adjustment:**
   - `total` remains 10.
   - `i` remains within the range \([1, n]\) because it does not change with `j`.
   - `n` remains greater than 0 because it does not change with `j`.
   - `nx` remains as it was determined at the end of the previous iteration since it does not depend on `j`.

### Final State:
- `total` is 10
- `i` is within the range \([1, n]\)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `nx` retains its value from the end of the previous iteration

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration (which does not occur in this case) would be the same as the state at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`total` is 10, `i` is within the range \([1, n]\), `n` must be greater than 0, `nx` retains its value from the end of the previous iteration**
