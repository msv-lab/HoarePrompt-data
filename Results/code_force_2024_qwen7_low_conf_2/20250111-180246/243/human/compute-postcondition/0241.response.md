Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `n`
- `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`
- `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values
- `sa` is an empty list
- `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`
- `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true
- `nx` is an empty string

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `j` using `range(1, n + 1)`.

### Analysis:
1. **Variable `j`:**
   - The loop will start with `j = 1` and continue until `j = n`.
   - Since the initial value of `j` is `n`, the loop will not start immediately because the condition `1 <= j < n + 1` is not satisfied initially.

2. **Variables `i`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, `nx`:**
   - These variables' initial values do not directly affect the loop's execution based on the given range condition.

### Required Adjustments:
To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that the loop condition is met initially.

- **Adjust `j` to start the loop:** 
  - The loop will start when `j` transitions from `n` to `1`. Thus, we need to set `j` to `1` to begin the loop.

### Final State:
- `i` remains as 2 (unchanged)
- `j` is adjusted to 1 to start the loop
- `xx` remains as a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`
- `a` and `b` remain as lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values
- `sa` remains as an empty list
- `sb` remains as a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`
- `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true
- `nx` remains as an empty string

### Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is an empty string**
