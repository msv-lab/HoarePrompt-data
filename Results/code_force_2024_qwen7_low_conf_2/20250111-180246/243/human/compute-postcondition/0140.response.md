Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `j` is 2.
   - `i` is within the range `[1, n]`.
   - If `xx[i][1]` is not `?`, then `nx` is increased by `xx[i][1]`.
   - Otherwise, if either `i` or `j` is within the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` is equal to its original value plus the string `'F'`.
   - Otherwise, `nx` is a string ending with 'S'.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n + 1`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `j` is currently 2.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, so `j` will become 3.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be 3.
   - The value of `i` remains within the range `[1, n]` as there is no indication that it changes during this loop iteration.
   - The condition for `nx` will be evaluated based on the new value of `j` (which is 3).

6. **Condition Check for `nx`:**
   - We need to check if `j` (which is now 3) falls within the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.
     - If `j` (3) is within the first `n // 4 - 1` elements, `nx` will be modified.
     - If `j` (3) is not within the first `n // 4 - 1` elements, `nx` will retain its current value.

7. **Final States:**
   - `n` remains a positive integer.
   - `j` is now 3.
   - `i` remains within the range `[1, n]`.
   - The value of `nx` will depend on the condition involving `j` and `sa`.

Given these steps, the final state before the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 3, `i` is within the range [1, n], and the value of `nx` will depend on whether `j` (3) is within the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.**
