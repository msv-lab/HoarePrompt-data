Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following:
   - `i` is 2
   - `j` is 1
   - `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`
   - `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values
   - `sa` is an empty list (`[]`)
   - `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`
   - `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true
   - `nx` is either `'S'`, `'F'`, or `['']` depending on the condition in the if statement.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `j < n + 1`.

3. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is 2 (unchanged)
   - `j` is 1 (we need to determine the new value for `j` after the loop execution)

4. **Determining the New Value of `j`**:
   - Since `j` starts at 1 and the loop runs until `j < n + 1`, after the first iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` will be `2`.

5. **Adjusting Other States**:
   - `i` remains unchanged at 2.
   - `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, and `nx` remain as they were at the end of the previous iteration unless there is a change in the loop body. Since the loop body is omitted, we assume no changes occur unless specified by the conditions inside the loop.

6. **Conditions Inside the Loop**:
   - The loop updates `nx` based on the condition: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, then `nx` remains `['']`. Otherwise, `nx` is either `'S'` or `'F'` based on the position of `i` or `j` within `sb`.

Given these points, we can conclude that at the start of the next iteration:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is now 2
- `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`, and `nx` remain unchanged as there is no information indicating a change in their values during the loop execution.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `nx` is either `'S'`, `'F'`, or `['']` depending on the condition in the if statement.**
