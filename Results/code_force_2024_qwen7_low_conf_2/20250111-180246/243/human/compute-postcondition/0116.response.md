`sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 2, to the list `sa`. Since `i` is 2, the list `sa` will now contain the value 2. The states of the other variables (`n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sb`, and `t`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa` is `[2]`, `sb`, and `t` remain unchanged.**
