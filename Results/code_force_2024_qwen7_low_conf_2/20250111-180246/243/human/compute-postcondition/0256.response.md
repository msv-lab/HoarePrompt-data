Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`. Depending on the value of `xx[2][1]` and the condition in the if statement, `nx` is either `'S' + val`, `'F' + val`, or `[''] + val`. If the else condition is met, `nx` is either `'SS'`, `'FS'`, or `['S']` if the condition is true, or `'SF'`, `'FF'`, or `['F']` if the condition is false.**
