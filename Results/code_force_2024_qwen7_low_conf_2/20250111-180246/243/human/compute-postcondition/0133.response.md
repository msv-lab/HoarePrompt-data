Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is updated based on the following conditions: 
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` is set to `nx` + `xx[i][j - 1]`.
- If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', then `nx` is either 'F' or 'S', depending on whether `i` or `j` is within the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. Specifically, `nx` is 'F' if `i` is within `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is within `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
