Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Initial Conditions:**
   - The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as: `n` is a positive integer, `j` is in the range [1, n + 1).
   - The loop increments `j` from 1 to `n`.

2. **Understand the Loop Body:**
   - For each value of `j` in the range [1, n + 1), the following operations are performed:
     - If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is incremented by 1.
     - If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[i]` and `b[j]` are each increased by 1.
     - Otherwise, the values of `a[j]`, `b[i]`, and `b[j]` remain unchanged.

3. **Determine the Next Value of `j`:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the next value of `j` would be `j + 1`.
   - Given that `j` is currently in the range [1, n + 1), the next value of `j` must be within this range.

4. **Check the Range Condition:**
   - If `j` is currently `n`, then the next value of `j` would be `n + 1`, which is outside the range [1, n + 1).
   - Therefore, if `j` is `n`, the loop will terminate after this iteration.
   - If `j` is less than `n`, the loop will continue, and the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

5. **Adjust the State:**
   - If `j` is currently `n`, the loop cannot execute again because `j` is no longer in the range [1, n + 1).
   - If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again, and the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.

Given the above analysis, let's summarize the state for both scenarios:

- **If `j` is `n`:**
  - The loop cannot execute again, so the state does not change.
  - State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is in the range [1, n + 1) (or specifically `j = n`).**

- **If `j` is less than `n`:**
  - The next value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
  - State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is in the range [1, n + 1) (or specifically `j = j + 1`).**

Since the question asks for the state when the loop can execute one more time, we consider the scenario where `j` is less than `n`:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is in the range [1, n + 1) (or specifically `j = j + 1`).**
