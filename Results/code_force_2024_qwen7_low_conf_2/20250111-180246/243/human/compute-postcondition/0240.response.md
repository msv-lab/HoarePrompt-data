The code `nx = ''` assigns an empty string to the variable `nx`. This does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is an empty string.**
