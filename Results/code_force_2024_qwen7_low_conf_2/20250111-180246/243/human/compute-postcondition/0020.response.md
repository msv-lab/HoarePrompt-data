The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value at index `j` in the list `b` by 1. Given that `j` is 2, the value at index 2 of the list `b` is incremented by 1. However, the initial state does not provide the initial value of `b`. Since the initial value of `b` is not specified, we can only say that the value at index 2 of `b` has been incremented by 1. The values of `n` and `j` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, the value at index 2 of list `b` is incremented by 1**
