`nx` is updated by appending the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to itself. The condition that determines the value of `nx` before this operation is either `xx[i][j]` is not '?', in which case `nx` is `xx[i][j]`, or `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'. After the operation, the value of `nx` will be the concatenation of its previous value and `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **`nx` is `nx` concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`; if `xx[i][j]` is not '?', then `nx` is `xx[i][j]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
