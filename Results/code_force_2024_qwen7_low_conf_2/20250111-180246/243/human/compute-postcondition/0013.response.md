`b[j]` is incremented by 1. Given the initial conditions, `x[j - 1]` is 'S', and `b[i]` is incremented by 1. The code does not affect `n`, and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` still holds true with `x[j - 1]` being 'S'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` holds true (with `x[j - 1]` being 'S'), and `b[i]` is incremented by 1; `b[j]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` holds true (with `x[j - 1]` being 'S'), and `b[i]` is incremented by 1; `b[j]` is incremented by 1.**
