The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string stored in `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` can be either `val`, `'S'`, or `'F'`. Since we need to consider all possibilities, we will handle each case separately.

1. If `nx` is `val`: The value of `nx` becomes `val + 'F'`, which means `nx` now contains `val + 'F'`.
2. If `nx` is `'S'`: The value of `nx` becomes `'S' + 'F'`, which means `nx` now contains `'SF'`.
3. If `nx` is `'F'`: The value of `nx` becomes `'F' + 'F'`, which means `nx` now contains `'FF'`.

In all cases, the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 2, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is either `val + 'F'`, `'SF'`, or `'FF'`.**
