`nx` is updated by adding the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the current value of `nx`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, `xx[i][j - 1]` refers to `xx[2][1]`. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `xx[2][1]`, so let's denote it as `val`. Therefore, `nx` will be updated to `nx + val`.

The initial value of `nx` is either `'S'`, `'F'`, or `['']` depending on the condition in the if statement. We need to consider each case:

1. If `nx` is `'S'`:
   - `nx` becomes `'S' + val`.
   
2. If `nx` is `'F'`:
   - `nx` becomes `'F' + val`.
   
3. If `nx` is `['']`:
   - `nx` becomes `[''] + val`.

Since `val` is not specified, we'll keep it as is.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 2, `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `nx` is either `'S' + val`, `'F' + val`, or `[''] + val` depending on the initial value of `nx`.
