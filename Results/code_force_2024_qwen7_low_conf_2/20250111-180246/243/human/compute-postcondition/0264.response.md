The code `print(nx)` prints the value of the variable `nx`. However, since there are no operations performed on `nx` before printing it, the value of `nx` remains the same as it was before this line of code. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the value of `nx` is printed.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is printed.**
