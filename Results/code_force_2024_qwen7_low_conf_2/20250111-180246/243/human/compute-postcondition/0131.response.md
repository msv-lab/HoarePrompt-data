The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the end of the string `nx`. Since `nx` was not defined in the initial state, it is implicitly initialized to be an empty string before this operation. The values of `n`, `j`, `i`, `xx`, and `sa` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is 'S', `n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `i` is within the range [1, n], and `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?', and (`i` not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1] and `j` not in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`).**
