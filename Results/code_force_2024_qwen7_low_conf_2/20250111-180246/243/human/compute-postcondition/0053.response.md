`a[j]` is assigned the value of `a[j] + 1`. Since `j` is 1, `a[1]` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `a` is not provided, so we only know that `a[1]` was initially set to some value and now it is increased by 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, `x[0]` equals either 'F' or 'S' or remains unchanged, and `a[1]` is incremented by 1.**
