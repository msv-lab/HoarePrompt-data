The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character `'F'` to the string stored in `nx`. Based on the initial state, `nx` was `'S'` before this operation. Therefore, after executing `nx += 'F'`, `nx` will be `'SF'`.

Let's update the state:

- `j` is 2.
- `n` is a positive integer (unchanged).
- `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`.
- `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values.
- `sa` is an empty list (unchanged).
- `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n` (unchanged).
- `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true.
- `nx` is now `'SF'`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is `'SF'`.**
