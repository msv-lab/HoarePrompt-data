`nx` is assigned the value of itself plus the string 'S'. Since the exact value of `nx` from the previous iteration is not specified, we can denote it as `nx_prev`. Therefore, after the code execution, `nx` will be `nx_prev + 'S'`.

The states of the other variables (`total` and `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is within the range \([1, n]\), `n` must be greater than 0, `nx` is `nx_prev + 'S'`**
