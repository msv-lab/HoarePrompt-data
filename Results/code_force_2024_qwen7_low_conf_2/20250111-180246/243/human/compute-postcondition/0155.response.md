The code snippet `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Given the initial state, `nx` is an empty string. After appending 'F', `nx` becomes 'F'.

The other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, `xx`, `sa`) remain unaffected by this operation.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is 'F', `n` must be greater than 0, and (xx[i][j - 1] == '?'), and either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`**
