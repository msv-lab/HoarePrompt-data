The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i`, which is 4, to the list `sa`. The value of `i` is 4, and `sa` initially contains `[3]`. After appending 4 to `sa`, the list `sa` becomes `[3, 4]`.

The values of the other variables (`n`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sb`) remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 4, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']` and for `k` from `1` to `n`, `xx[k]` is the `k`-th input string, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `sa` is `[3, 4]`, and `sb` is `[3]` if `b[3] > 0` and `a[3] == 0`, and otherwise, `sb` retains its initial state.**
