Postcondition: ***`nx` is a string. If `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F'. Otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'. Additionally, if `xx[i][j]` is not '?', `nx` is originally `xx[i][j]`; otherwise, it follows the conditions specified in the if part.***
