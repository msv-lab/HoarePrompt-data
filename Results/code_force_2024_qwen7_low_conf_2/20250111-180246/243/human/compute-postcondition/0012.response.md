`b[i]` is incremented by 1. The value of `x[j - 1]` remains 'S' and the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` still holds true. The value of `n` remains a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` holds true, and the current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'S'; `b[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, the condition `x[j - 1] != 'F'` holds true, and the current value of `x[j - 1]` is 'S'; `b[i]` is incremented by 1**
