Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is within the range [1, n], `n` must be greater than 0, `nx` is determined as follows: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', then `nx` equals the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`. Otherwise, `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in the range `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.***
