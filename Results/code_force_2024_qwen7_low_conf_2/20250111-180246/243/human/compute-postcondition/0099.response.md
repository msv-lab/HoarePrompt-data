The code `sa.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 3) to the list `sa`. Since `sa` was initially an empty list, appending `i` changes its state. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']` and for `k` from `1` to `n`, `xx[k]` is the `k`-th input string, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `sa` is now `[3]` (the list with one element 3) and `sb` remains an empty list.**
