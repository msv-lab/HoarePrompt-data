Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is within the range \([1, n]\), `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2. If `xx[i][1]` is not '?', `nx` is updated by adding `xx[i][1]` to its current value. Otherwise, `nx` is either the original value of `nx` plus 'S' or 'F', depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of list `sa`.***
