The code snippet `xx.append(x)` appends the value of `x` to the list `xx`. Since `xx` was initially defined as `xx[0] = ['']` and `xx[1] = x`, appending `x` to `xx` means `xx` will now be `xx[0] = [''], xx[1] = x, xx[2] = x`.

Other variables such as `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n + 1`, `xx[0]` is `['']`, `xx[1]` is `x`, `xx[2]` is `x`, `a` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element `a[k]` is incremented by the number of occurrences of 'F' at position `k` in `x` (for `k` from `1` to `n + 1`), `b` is a list of length `n + 2` where each element `b[k]` is incremented by the number of occurrences of 'S' at position `k` in `x` (for `k` from `1` to `n + 1`).**
