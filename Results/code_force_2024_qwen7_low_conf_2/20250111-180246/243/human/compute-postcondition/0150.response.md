State before the loop starts: `j` is `n + 1`, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is an empty string, and the printed output is an empty string.

To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the for loop:

```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

1. **Range of `j`:** The loop iterates over values from 1 to `n` (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to start, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0) because the range function in Python does not include the upper bound if it is equal to or less than the lower bound.

2. **Initial value of `j`:** The variable `j` is initially set to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute, `j` should not be within the range 1 to `n` initially. Since `j` starts at `n + 1`, this is already correct for the loop to enter its first iteration.

3. **Variable `i`:** The initial state of `i` is given as being within the range [1, n]. This is fine since the loop will start iterating from `j = 1` onwards.

4. **String `nx`:** The string `nx` is an empty string. This state does not affect the loop's execution directly.

5. **Printed output:** The printed output is currently an empty string. This state does not affect the loop's execution directly either.

Given the above analysis, the only state that needs adjustment is ensuring that `n` is a positive integer (greater than 0), so the loop can start iterating from `j = 1`.

State: **`total` is 10 (not relevant here), `i` is within the range [1, n] (already correct), `nx` is an empty string (not relevant here), `n` must be greater than 0**
