The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character `'S'` to the string stored in `nx`. Given that in the previous state, `nx` was `'S'`, appending `'S'` to it results in `nx` becoming `'SS'`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Here are the updated values:
- `j` is 2.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`.
- `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values.
- `sa` is an empty list.
- `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`.
- `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true.
- `nx` is now `'SS'`.

Output State: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is `'SS'`.**
