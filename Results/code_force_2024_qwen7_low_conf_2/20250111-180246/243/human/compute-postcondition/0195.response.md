`nx` is a string constructed based on the rules given, `j` is incremented by 1 (`j + 1`), and `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]` are the values to be checked for constructing the next segment of `nx`. The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character 'S' to the string `nx`.

Therefore, the output state is: `nx` is now the original string plus 'S', `j` is `j + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`nx` is the original string plus 'S', `j` is `j + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]` remain unchanged.**
