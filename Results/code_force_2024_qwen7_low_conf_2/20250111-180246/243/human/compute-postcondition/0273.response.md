Postcondition: **`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is an empty string, `xx[i][j - 1]` is `'?'`, and neither `i` nor `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`**
