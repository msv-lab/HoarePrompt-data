`nx` is assigned the value of `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`. Given the initial state, `i` is 3, `j` is 1, and `xx[i][j - 1]` is not equal to `'?'`. Therefore, `nx` will be updated by appending `xx[3][0]` to its current value (which is an empty string). Since `xx[3][0]` is not specified, let's denote it as a specific value `val`. Thus, `nx` becomes `val`.

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is `val`.**
