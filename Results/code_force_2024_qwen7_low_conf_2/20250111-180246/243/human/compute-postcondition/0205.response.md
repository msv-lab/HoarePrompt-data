Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1`, `sa` and `sb` are lists with `sb` containing `[1]`, and `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true. If `a[i]` is 0 and `b[i]` is 0, then `a[i]` remains 0 and `b[i]` remains 0. Otherwise, the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged.***
