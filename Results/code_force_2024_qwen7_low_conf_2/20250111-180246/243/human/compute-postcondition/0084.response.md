Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1); `j` is 5; `x` is an input string; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2`; `b` is a list of length `n + 2`. If `x[j - 1]` (which is `x[4]`) is 'S', then `b`'s 5th element is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `b`'s 5th element remains unchanged.***
