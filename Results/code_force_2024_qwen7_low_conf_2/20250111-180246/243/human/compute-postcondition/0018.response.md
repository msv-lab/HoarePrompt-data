`a[j]` is updated by adding 1 to its current value. Since `j` is 2, the code is equivalent to `a[2] += 1`. The value of `n` remains a positive integer, but the specific value of `a[2]` is not given, so we only know it has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `a[2]` is incremented by 1**
