The code `print(nx)` prints the value of the variable `nx`, but does not change the value of `nx`. The values of `j`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, except that `nx` is printed.

Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `i` is `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `nx` is constructed based on the given rules, and `nx` is printed.**
