The code snippet `print(nx)` prints the value of the variable `nx`. However, the value of `nx` is not defined or modified in the given code snippet. Therefore, the only impact of this line of code is the print statement itself.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from 1 to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is printed.**
