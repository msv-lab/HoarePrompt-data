Functionality: **The function `func` accepts a matrix of characters representing transitions between scenarios, where each line contains `n` characters and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 24. The characters can be 'F' (funny), 'S' (scary), '?', or '.' (no transition video yet decided). At most 2⌊n/2⌋ characters in the input are 'F' or 'S'. The function processes this input to determine if certain conditions are met and constructs a new matrix of characters based on these conditions.**

- If the number of indices with only 'F' transitions (`sa`) is greater than or equal to the number of indices with only 'S' transitions (`sb`), the function constructs a new matrix where:
  - For positions not already decided ('?'), it assigns 'F' if the index is in the first quarter of `sa`, otherwise 'F'.
  - For other positions, it assigns 'S' if the index is in the first quarter of `sa`, otherwise 'F'.

- If the number of indices with only 'S' transitions (`sb`) is greater than the number of indices with only 'F' transitions (`sa`), the function constructs a new matrix where:
  - For positions not already decided ('?'), it assigns 'S' if the index is in the first quarter of `sb`, otherwise 'F'.
  - For other positions, it assigns 'F' if the index is in the first quarter of `sb`, otherwise 'F'.

- The function then prints the new matrix of characters.

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- The function assumes that the input always satisfies the constraint that at most 2⌊n/2⌋ characters are 'F' or 'S'. If this constraint is violated, the behavior of the function is undefined.
- The function does not handle the case where both `sa` and `sb` are empty, though this scenario is covered implicitly in the second part of the if-else block.
