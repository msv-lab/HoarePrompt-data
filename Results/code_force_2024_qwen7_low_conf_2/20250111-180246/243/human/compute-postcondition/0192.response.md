To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions given in the problem and how they affect the variable `nx`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initialization**: The initial state is not explicitly given, but we know that `nx` is a string that is constructed based on the values of `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs from `j = 1` to `j = n`.

3. **Key Conditions for `nx`**:
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?':
     - `nx` is concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j]` is not '?':
     - `nx` is set to `xx[i][j]`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is '?':
     - `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'F' if `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'.
   - If `xx[i][j]` is not '?', `nx` is originally `xx[i][j]`.

4. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Let's assume at the end of the previous iteration (when `j` was the current value minus 1), `nx` was constructed based on the above rules.

5. **Next Iteration (`j` incremented by 1)**:
   - We need to check the conditions for the new value of `j`.

### State Adjustments:

Given that `j` is incremented by 1, we need to adjust the state for the new value of `j` in the loop.

#### Key Points:
- The condition for `j` being incremented does not change the fact that `nx` is constructed based on the values of `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]`.
- The only difference is that `j` is now `j + 1`.

#### New State:
- Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` is `j + 1`.
- The conditions for constructing `nx` remain the same but apply to `xx[i][j]` and `xx[i][j + 1]`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should reflect the updated value of `j`.

### Final Answer:

State: **`nx` is a string constructed based on the rules given, `j` is incremented by 1 to `j + 1`, and all other conditions for `nx` remain the same.**

To be more precise, we can write:

State: **`nx` is a string constructed based on the rules given, `j` is `j + 1`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` and `xx[i][j]` are the values to be checked for constructing the next segment of `nx`.**

This ensures that the loop can proceed to the next iteration with the correct conditions for updating `nx`.
