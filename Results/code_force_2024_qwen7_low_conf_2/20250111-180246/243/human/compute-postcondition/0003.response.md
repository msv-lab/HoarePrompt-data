`xx` is assigned the value `['']`. The value of `n` remains the integer input provided by the user, and the lists `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is the integer input provided by the user; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0; `xx` is `['']`.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided by the user; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0; `xx` is `['']`.**
