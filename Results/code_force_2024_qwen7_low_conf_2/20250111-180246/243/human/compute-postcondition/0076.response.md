`b[j]` is incremented by 1. Given that `j` is 4, the value of `b[4]` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `b[4]` is unknown, but after incrementing, it will be `b[4] + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1); `j` is 4; `x` is an input string; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2`; `b` is a list of length `n + 2` with `b[4]` incremented by 1.**
