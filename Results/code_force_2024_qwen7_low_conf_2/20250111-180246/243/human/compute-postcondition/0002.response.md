The code initializes a new list `b` with `n + 1` elements, all set to 0. This operation does not affect the value of `n` or the contents of the list `a`. Therefore, the list `a` remains unchanged, and the newly created list `b` is initialized with the specified length.

Output State: **`n` is the integer input provided by the user; `a` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0; `b` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements equal to 0**
