Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 3, and `i` is within the range [1, n]. If `xx[i][2]` is not '?', then `nx` is updated by adding `xx[i][2]` to its current value. Otherwise, `nx` retains its previous value. If `i` or `j` (both 3) is within the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` retains its previous value. Otherwise, `nx` is updated to include 'S' appended to its previous value.***
