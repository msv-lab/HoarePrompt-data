The code `sb.append(i)` appends the value of `i` (which is 4) to the list `sb`. Since `i` is 4, `sb` will now be `[3, 4, 4]`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 4, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']` and for `k` from `1` to `n`, `xx[k]` is the `k`-th input string, `a` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `a[k]` is the total count of 'F' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `b` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element `b[k]` is the total count of 'S' at position `k-1` in any of the input strings, `sa` is `[3, 4]`, and `sb` is `[3, 4, 4]`.**
