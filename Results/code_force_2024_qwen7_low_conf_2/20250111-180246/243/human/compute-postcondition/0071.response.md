Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1); `j` is a value from 1 to `n + 1`; `x` is an input string; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2`; `b` is a list of length `n + 2`. If `x[j - 1]` is 'F', then `a[j]` is increased by 1. If `x[j - 1]` is 'S', then `b[j]` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.***
