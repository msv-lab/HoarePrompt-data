Postcondition: **`i` is 2, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is either `'S'`, `'F'`, or `['']` depending on the condition in the if statement. If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `'?'`, `nx` remains `['']`. Otherwise, `nx` is either `'S'` or `'F'` based on the position of `i` or `j` within `sb`.**
