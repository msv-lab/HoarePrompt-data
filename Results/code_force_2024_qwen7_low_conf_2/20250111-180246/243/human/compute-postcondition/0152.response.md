The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` appends the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` to the string `nx`. Given the initial state where `nx` is an empty string, `total` is 10, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is an empty string, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?', the value of `nx` changes.

Since `nx` was initially an empty string and now it is concatenated with the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`, the new value of `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is the value of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `n` must be greater than 0, and the current value of `xx[i][j - 1]` is not '?'**
