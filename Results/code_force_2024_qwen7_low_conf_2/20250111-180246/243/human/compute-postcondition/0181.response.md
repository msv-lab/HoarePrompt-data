The code `nx += 'F'` appends the character 'F' to the string `nx`. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, appending 'F' to it changes its value to 'F'. The other variables (`n`, `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, and `j`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`nx` is 'F', `n` is greater than 0, `xx[i][j - 1]` is equal to '?', `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`**
