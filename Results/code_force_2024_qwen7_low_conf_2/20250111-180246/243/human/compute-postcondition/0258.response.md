`nx` is assigned the value of `nx + xx[i][j - 1]`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, `xx[i][j - 1]` translates to `xx[2][2]`. Since `xx[0]` is `['']`, there are no elements for `xx[2]`. Therefore, the value of `xx[2][2]` is `''`.

Thus, `nx` is updated to its current value plus `''`, which means `nx` remains unchanged because adding an empty string to anything does not change the value.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `j` is 3, `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `nx` is unchanged**
