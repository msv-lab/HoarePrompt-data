Postcondition: **`j` is 2, `n` is a positive integer, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true. If `i` is in the first quarter of `sb`, `nx` is `'SS'`; otherwise, `nx` is `'SF'`.**
