`nx` is assigned the value of itself plus the string `'S'`. Since the initial state does not specify what `nx` is, we can only say that `nx` is now a string that ends with the letter `'S'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is a string ending with 'S'**
