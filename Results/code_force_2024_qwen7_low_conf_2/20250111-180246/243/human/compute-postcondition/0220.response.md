`nx` is assigned the value of `nx` concatenated with 'S'. Since `nx` was initially an empty string, after this operation, `nx` will become 'S'. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`j` is 1, `n` is a positive integer, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` where the values of `a[i]` and `b[i]` remain unchanged, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list that must contain all indices from `1` to `n` after the loop, and `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true after the loop, and `nx` is 'S', and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, and either `i` is in the first quarter of `sb` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`.**
