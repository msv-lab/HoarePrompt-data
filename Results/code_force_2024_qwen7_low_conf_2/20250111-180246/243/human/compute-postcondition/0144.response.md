Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 3, `i` is within the range [1, n]. The value of `nx` will be updated as follows: 
- If either `i` or `j` (both now 3) is within the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`, then `nx` retains its previous value.
- Otherwise, `nx` is updated to include 'S' appended to its previous value.***
