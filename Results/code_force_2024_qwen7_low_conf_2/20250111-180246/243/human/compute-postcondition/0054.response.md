The code snippet `b[i] += 1` attempts to increment the value at index `i` in the list `b` by 1. However, the variable `b` is not defined in the initial state, and there are no other definitions or assignments for `b` given. Therefore, the code will raise a NameError because `b` is not defined.

Since the code results in an error and does not successfully execute, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 1, and `x[0]` equals either 'F' or 'S'**
