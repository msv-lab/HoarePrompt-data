Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `j` is 1, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is either `'S'` or `'F'`, depending on whether `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`. If `i` or `j` is in `sb[:n // 4 - 1]`, then `nx` is `'S'`. Otherwise, `nx` is `'F'`, and `xx[i][j - 1]` remains `'?'`.***
