`nx` is initially either `'S'`, `'F'`, or `['']`. The code `nx += 'S'` appends the character `'S'` to `nx`. This means that if `nx` was `'S'` before, it will become `'SS'`. If `nx` was `'F'`, it will become `'FS'`. And if `nx` was `['']`, it will become `['S']`.

Therefore, the updated value of `nx` depends on its original value. Since the original value of `nx` could be one of the three possibilities, we need to consider each case.

- If `nx` was `'S'`, it now becomes `'SS'`.
- If `nx` was `'F'`, it now becomes `'FS'`.
- If `nx` was `['']`, it now becomes `['S']`.

The states of the other variables (`i`, `j`, `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, `sb`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`i` is 2; `j` is 2; `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`; `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values; `sa` is an empty list; `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`; `nx` is either `'SS'`, `'FS'`, or `['S']` depending on its original value.**
