According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `j` is `n + 1`
- `i` is `n`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `nx` is constructed based on the given rules and printed

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 and should still be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` was `n` in the previous iteration, it will become `n + 1` in the next iteration.

However, since the condition for the loop is `i <= n`, when `i` becomes `n + 1`, the loop will terminate. Therefore, the loop will not execute again because the condition `i <= n` will no longer be true.

Given this analysis, we don't need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one more time, as it won't. Instead, we should note that the loop has already completed its iterations.

State: **No changes needed; the loop has completed its iterations.**
