The code `nx += 'S'` attempts to add the string `'S'` to the variable `nx`. However, the initial state does not define what `nx` is. Since `nx` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine its current value or type. Therefore, after executing this line of code, `nx` will be assigned the string `'S'` appended to whatever was the original value of `nx`. The other variables (`total`, `i`, `n`, and `j`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is within the range \([1, n]\), `n` must be greater than 0, `j` is 2, `nx` is the original value of `nx` plus 'S'**
