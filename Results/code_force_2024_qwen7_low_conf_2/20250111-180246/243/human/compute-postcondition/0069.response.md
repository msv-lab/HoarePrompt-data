The code `b[j] += 1` increments the value of `b[j]` by 1. Given that `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`, the value of `b[j]` will be increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1)
- `j` starts at 1 and goes up to `n + 1`
- `x` is an input string
- `xx[0]` is `['']`
- `xx[1]` is `x`
- `xx[2]` is `x`
- `a` is a list of length `n + 2`
- `b` is a list of length `n + 2`
- `x[j - 1]` is not equal to 'F' and is 'S'
- `b[i]` is increased by 1

Since `b[j]` is the specific element in the list `b` that is being incremented, the updated value of `b[j]` will be the original value plus 1. However, since the exact initial value of `b[j]` is not provided, we only know that it has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1); `j` is between 1 and `n + 1`; `x` is an input string; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2`; `b` is a list of length `n + 2`; `b[j]` is increased by 1; `x[j - 1]` is 'S'.**
