Let's analyze the given information and the for loop step by step:

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `j` is `n`
- `n` is a positive integer
- `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`
- `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values
- `sa` is an empty list
- `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`
- `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true
- `nx` is a string consisting of 'S' and 'F' based on the condition that if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then 'S' is appended, otherwise 'F' is appended. `nx` is printed.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes up to `i = n`.
2. **Initial Value of `i`**: Since the loop is about to start, `i` is set to `1` at the beginning of the current iteration.
3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to continue, `i` must be less than `n + 1`.

Given that `i` is currently `1` (the first iteration), the loop will proceed as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. Since `i` starts at `1`, the next value `i` will take is `2`.

### States to Adjust for the Next Iteration:
- `i` will now be `2`.
- `j` remains `n` because it was not modified in the loop body.
- The lengths and contents of `xx`, `a`, `b`, `sa`, and `sb` remain unchanged.
- `nx` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is now `2`) and `j` (which is still `n`).

### Updated State:
- `i` is `2`
- `j` is `n`
- `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`
- `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values
- `sa` is an empty list
- `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`
- `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true
- `nx` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is `2`) and `j` (which is still `n`)

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` will be updated based on the new value of `i` (which is `2`) and `j` (which is still `n`).**
