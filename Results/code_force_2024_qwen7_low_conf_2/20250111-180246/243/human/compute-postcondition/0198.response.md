Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final state of `nx` after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State
- `nx` is an empty string.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `xx` is a 2D list (a list of lists).
- `sa` is a list of integers.

### Loop Code
```python
for j in range(1, n + 1):
    if xx[i][j - 1] != '?':
        nx += xx[i][j - 1]
    elif i in sa[:n // 4 - 1] or j in sa[:n // 4 - 1]:
        nx += 'F'
    else:
        nx += 'S'
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Execution and Final State of `nx`:**
   - The loop iterates from `j = 1` to `j = n`.
   - For each iteration, `nx` is updated based on the value of `xx[i][j - 1]` and the condition involving `sa`.

2. **Final Value of `nx`:**
   - After the loop completes, `nx` will be a string that has been built up through the loop.
   - The final value of `nx` will be determined by the concatenation of characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` or the character `'F'` or `'S'` based on the conditions inside the loop.

3. **Conditions Inside the Loop:**
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` is directly appended with `xx[i][j - 1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, `nx` is updated based on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`:
     - If either `i` or `j` is in the first quarter (`sa[:n // 4 - 1]`), `nx` is appended with `'F'`.
     - Otherwise, `nx` is appended with `'S'`.

### Output State After All Iterations

- `nx` will be a string that is constructed by appending characters from `xx[i][j - 1]` when it is not `?`.
- When `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, `nx` will be updated with `'F'` or `'S'` depending on whether `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa`.

### Final Output State

Given that the loop will execute exactly `n` times, the final value of `nx` will be determined by the rules described above.

**Output State:**
- `nx` is a string where each character is either `xx[i][j - 1]` (if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`), `'F'` (if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sa` and `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`), or `'S'` (otherwise).

Thus, the final output state is:

**Output State: **`nx` is a string where each character is determined by the rules: if `xx[i][j - 1]` is not `?`, `nx` is concatenated with `xx[i][j - 1]`; if `xx[i][j - 1]` is `?`, `nx` is 'F' if either `i` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]` or `j` is in `sa[:n // 4 - 1]`; otherwise, `nx` is 'S'.**
