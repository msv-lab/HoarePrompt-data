`nx` is assigned the value of itself plus the string `'F'`. The initial value of `nx` is not specified, but since it retains its value from the end of the previous iteration, we assume it was an empty string before this operation. After adding `'F'`, `nx` becomes `'F'`.

The states of the other variables (`total` and `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is within the range \([1, n]\), `n` must be greater than 0, `nx` is `'F'`.**
