`x` is assigned the value of `input()`, which reads a string from the input. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `i` is `n + 1`; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` where all elements are integers initialized to 0; `x` is an input string.**
