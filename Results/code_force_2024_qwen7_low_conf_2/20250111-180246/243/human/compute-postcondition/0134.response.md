To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and follow the steps:

1. **Initial States**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `j` is 1.
   - `i` is within the range `[1, n]`.
   - `nx` is updated based on specific conditions involving `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, and `j`.

2. **Loop Condition**: 
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n` inclusive.

3. **State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `j` is 1 (end of the previous iteration).
   - `i` is within the range `[1, n]`.
   - `nx` has been updated according to the given conditions.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `j` will be 2 at the start of the next iteration.

5. **Adjusting Other States**:
   - `i` remains within the range `[1, n]` as it was not affected by the loop iteration.
   - `nx` will be updated again based on the new value of `j`.

Given these points, we can summarize the states needed for the next iteration:

- `n` remains a positive integer.
- `j` is now 2.
- `i` is still within the range `[1, n]`.
- `nx` will be updated based on the new value of `j`.

Thus, the states to be adjusted are:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is 2, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` is updated based on the conditions provided.**

This ensures that the loop can execute one more time with the updated state of `j`.
