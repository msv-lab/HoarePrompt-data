`a[j]` is assigned the value of `a[j] + 1`. The value of `j` is in the range [1, n + 1), which means it is a positive integer less than `n + 1`. The value at index `i` of list `a` has been incremented by 1, and now the value at index `j` of list `a` is also incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `j` is in the range [1, n + 1); the value at index `i` of list `a` has been incremented by 1; the value at index `j` of list `a` has been incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `j` is in the range [1, n + 1); the value at index `i` of list `a` has been incremented by 1; the value at index `j` of list `a` has been incremented by 1.**
