The code `nx += xx[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `nx` by adding `xx[i][j - 1]` to its current value. However, the values of `xx[i][j - 1]`, `i`, and `j` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact updated value of `nx`. But we know that `nx` has been incremented by `xx[i][j - 1]`.

The initial conditions are:
- `total` is 10
- `i` is within the range \([1, n]\)
- `n` must be greater than 0
- `nx` retains its value from the end of the previous iteration

Since we don't have the exact values of `i`, `j`, and `xx[i][j - 1]`, we can only say that `nx` has been updated by adding `xx[i][j - 1]` to its previous value.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is within the range \([1, n]\), `n` must be greater than 0, `nx` is updated by adding `xx[i][j - 1]` to its previous value**
