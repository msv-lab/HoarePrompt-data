The code `print(nx)` simply prints the value of `nx`. Since no further assignment or modification to `nx` is made, the value of `nx` remains unchanged after executing this line of code. Therefore, the output state will include the value of `nx` as it was before the print statement.

Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `i` is within the range [1, n], `nx` contains the concatenated string formed by processing `xx[i][j-1]` according to the specified rules, and `nx` is printed.**
