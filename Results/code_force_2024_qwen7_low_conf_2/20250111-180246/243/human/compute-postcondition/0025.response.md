`a[j]` is incremented by 1. The value of `j` is 3, so `a[3]` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains unchanged since it was not directly involved in the operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `j` is 3; `a[3]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `j` is 3; `a[3]` is incremented by 1**
