Postcondition: ***`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` and `sb` are lists of indices based on the conditions given, and `nx` is a string constructed as follows: 
- If `len(sa) >= len(sb)`, `nx` is constructed by processing each character in `xx[i][j-1]` for all `i` and `j` according to the specified rules, and `nx` is printed for each iteration. `sa` remains unchanged and `t` is the length of `sa`.
- If `len(sa) < len(sb)`, `nx` is a string consisting of 'S' and 'F' based on the condition that if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then 'S' is appended, otherwise 'F' is appended. `nx` is printed.***

This postcondition captures the overall state of the program after the execution of the if-else block, considering both possible paths of execution.
