The code `a[i] += 1` increments the value of `a[i]` by 1. However, the value of `i` is not specified in the given code snippet. Since the value of `i` is not mentioned, we cannot determine the exact value that `a[i]` will be incremented by. Therefore, the only specific change is to `a[i]`.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1)
- `j` is 5
- `x` is an input string
- `xx[0]` is `['']`
- `xx[1]` is `x`
- `xx[2]` is `x`
- `a` is a list of length `n + 2`
- `b` is a list of length `n + 2`

The condition to increment elements in `a` or `b` depends on the value of `x[j - 1]` (which is `x[4]`). Since this condition is not evaluated in the given code snippet, the states of `a` and `b` remain unchanged except for the specific increment of `a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (greater than or equal to 1); `j` is 5; `x` is an input string; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `xx[2]` is `x`; `a` is a list of length `n + 2`; `b` is a list of length `n + 2`; `a[i]` is incremented by 1.**
