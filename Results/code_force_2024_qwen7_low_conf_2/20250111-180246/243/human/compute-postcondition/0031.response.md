The code appends the list `x` to the list `xx`. Given the initial state:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `i` is `n + 1`
- `xx` is `['']`
- `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` where all elements are integers initialized to 0.

After executing the line `xx.append(x)`, the list `xx` will contain two elements: the original empty string and the list `x`.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `xx[0]` is `['']`
- `xx[1]` is `x`

The values of `n`, `i`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `i` is `n + 1`; `xx[0]` is `['']`; `xx[1]` is `x`; `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` where all elements are integers initialized to 0.**
