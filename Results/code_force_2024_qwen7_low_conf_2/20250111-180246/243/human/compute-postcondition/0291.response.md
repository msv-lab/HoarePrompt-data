Output State: **`i` is `n + 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is a string consisting of 'S' and 'F' based on the condition that if `i` or `j` is in the first quarter of `sb`, then 'S' is appended, otherwise 'F' is appended. `nx` is printed.**

### Explanation:

1. **Loop Execution**: The outer loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. Each iteration of the inner loop runs from `1` to `n + 1`. Since the outer loop runs `n` times (as the initial state sets `i` to `n + 1`), and the inner loop runs `n + 1` times, the loops together run exactly `n * (n + 1)` times.

2. **Variable `i`**: After the loop completes, `i` will be `n + 1`.

3. **Variable `j`**: Since the inner loop runs `n + 1` times each time the outer loop runs, `j` will also be `n + 1` at the end of the last iteration.

4. **List `xx`**: `xx` remains a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`. The values within `xx` are not modified by the loop.

5. **Lists `a` and `b`**: These lists remain unchanged throughout the loop.

6. **List `sa`**: This list remains empty because no elements are added to it in the loop.

7. **List `sb`**: This list contains all indices from `1` to `n` as long as the loop executes for all iterations. If the loop does not execute fully, `sb` would be empty, but since the problem specifies that the loop executes for all iterations, `sb` remains `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

8. **Condition `(len(sa) < len(sb))`**: This condition holds true because `sa` is always empty, and `sb` contains `n` elements.

9. **String `nx`**: `nx` is constructed based on the condition inside the inner loop. Since both `i` and `j` go through all values from `1` to `n + 1`, `nx` will contain a combination of 'S' and 'F' based on whether `i` or `j` falls within the first quarter of `sb`.

Given the above points, after the loop completes, the values of the variables will be as described in the output state.
