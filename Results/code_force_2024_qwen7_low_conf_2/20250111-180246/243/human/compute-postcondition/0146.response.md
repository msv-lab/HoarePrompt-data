To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop and its effects on the variables `nx`, `i`, and `j`.

### Loop Analysis

The loop iterates over `j` from 1 to `n`. For each iteration, it checks the value of `xx[i][j-1]`:
- If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', it appends `xx[i][j-1]` to `nx`.
- If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', it appends either 'F' or 'S' to `nx` based on certain conditions involving `i` and `j` relative to `sa`.

### Key Observations

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `i` is within the range `[1, n]`.
   - `nx` starts as an empty string.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each `j` from 1 to `n`, the loop processes `xx[i][j-1]`.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is not '?', it directly appends to `nx`.
   - If `xx[i][j-1]` is '?', it appends 'F' or 'S' based on whether `i` or `j` is within the first `n // 4 - 1` elements of `sa`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, `j` will be `n + 1` (since the loop exits after `j` reaches `n`).
   - `i` will still be within the range `[1, n]`.
   - `nx` will contain the concatenated string built from `xx[i][j-1]` values processed during the loop, adhering to the specified rules.

### Determining the Final Values

Since the loop runs completely for all `j` from 1 to `n`, the final state will reflect the concatenation of all relevant characters from `xx[i][j-1]` based on the rules provided.

### Output State

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the following will be true:
- `j` will be `n + 1` because the loop exits when `j` reaches `n`.
- `i` will still be within the range `[1, n]`.
- `nx` will contain the concatenated string formed by appending `xx[i][j-1]` (if not '?') or 'F' or 'S' (based on the condition involving `i` and `j` relative to `sa`).

### Final Output State

Given the above analysis, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:

Output State: **`j` is `n + 1`, `i` is within the range [1, n], and `nx` contains the concatenated string formed by processing `xx[i][j-1]` according to the specified rules.**
