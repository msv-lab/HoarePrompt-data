`nx` is assigned the value `''`. This means `nx` is now an empty string. The values of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `j` is `n + 1`, `xx` is a list of length `n + 1` where `xx[0]` is `['']`, `a` and `b` are lists of length `n + 1` with unchanged values, `sa` is an empty list, `sb` is a list containing all indices from `1` to `n`, `(len(sa) < len(sb))` still holds true, and `nx` is an empty string.**
