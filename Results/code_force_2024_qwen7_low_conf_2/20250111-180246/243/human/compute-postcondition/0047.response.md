The code snippet `b[i] += 1` increments the value of `b[i]` by 1, but the initial state does not specify the value of `i` or the array `b`. Since the precondition mentions `j` is in the range `[1, n + 1)` and `j = j + 1`, it implies that `j` is now `n + 1`. However, this change does not affect the array `b` or the variable `i`. Therefore, the only change is to the array `b` at index `i`.

Given that the initial state includes `n` being a positive integer and `j` being in the range `[1, n + 1)` which now means `j = n + 1`, and since `i` is not specified but the operation modifies `b[i]`, we can conclude that `b[i]` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `j` is `n + 1`, `b[i]` is incremented by 1**
