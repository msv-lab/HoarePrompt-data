The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and a string `s` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`. It first counts the occurrences of each character ('N', 'S', 'E', 'W') in the string `s`. If the counts of 'N' and 'S' are not equal or the counts of 'E' and 'W' are not equal, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string consisting of 'H' and 'R' based on the values of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' in `s`, ensuring that the counts of 'N' and 'S' are balanced and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are balanced. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either 'NO' or a string composed of 'H' and 'R' depending on the balance of the counts of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W'.
