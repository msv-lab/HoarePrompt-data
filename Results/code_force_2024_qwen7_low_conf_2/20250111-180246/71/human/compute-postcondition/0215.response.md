The code snippet provided is `r += 1`. This means that the value of `r` is incremented by 1. From the summary of the final state before this line of code was executed, we know that `r` was previously 1. Therefore, the new value of `r` will be `1 + 1 = 2`.

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
