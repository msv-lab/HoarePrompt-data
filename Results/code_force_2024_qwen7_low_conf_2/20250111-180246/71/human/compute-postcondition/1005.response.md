The value of `r` is incremented by 1, so `r += 1` changes the value of `r`. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, `r` is increased by 1.**
