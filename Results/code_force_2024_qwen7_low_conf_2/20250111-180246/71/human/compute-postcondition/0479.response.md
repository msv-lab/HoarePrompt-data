Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `0`, `h` is either `0` or `1` depending on the condition of `ee % 2 == 1`, the current value of `ee` is even, `(nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and 0 % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0)`, `pp` is either `['H']` or an empty list `[]`, `rr` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.*
