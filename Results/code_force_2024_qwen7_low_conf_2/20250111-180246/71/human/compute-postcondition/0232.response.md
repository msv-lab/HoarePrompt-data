The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'H'`, the list `pp` will contain the element `'H'`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, 1], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is ['H']**
