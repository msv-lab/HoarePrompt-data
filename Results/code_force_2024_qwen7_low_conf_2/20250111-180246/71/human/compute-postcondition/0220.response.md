`ee` is decremented by 1. Initially, `ee` is 0, so after the decrement, `ee` becomes -1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is either 1 or 2, `h` is either 1 or 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is -1, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, and `pp` is either ['R'] or ['H'] depending on the value of `ee`.**
