Postcondition: ***`rr[2]`, `hh[2]`, `r`, `h`, `pp` are as follows:
- If `rr[2] > 0`, then `rr[2]` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains a list containing at least one element, which is `'R'`.
- If `hh[2]` is true, then `hh[2]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.
- If neither condition holds, then `hh[2]` is false, `r < h`, and `rr` is updated to `[a, b, c, d + 2]`, and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
- If all previous conditions fail, then `hh[3]` is incremented by 1, and all other variables (`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`) are incremented by 1, and the initial values of `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are restored.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program after executing the if-else block based on the provided conditions.
