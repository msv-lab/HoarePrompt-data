In the given code snippet, `rr[3]` is incremented by 1. The value of `rr[3]` will be updated, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Let's assume the initial state of `rr` is as follows (since the exact initial state is not provided, we will use a placeholder):
- `rr = [a, b, c, d]`

After executing the line `rr[3] += 1`, the value of `d` (which is `rr[3]`) will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the updated state of `rr` is:
- `rr = [a, b, c, d + 1]`

Output State: **`rr` is `[a, b, c, d + 1]`**
