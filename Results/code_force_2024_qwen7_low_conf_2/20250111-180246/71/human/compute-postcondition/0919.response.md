Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N'. If `hh[1]` is 0, then `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing at least one element including 'H'. Otherwise, if `r < h` holds true, then `pp` is a list containing its original elements plus `'R'`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `r < h` still holds. Otherwise, the first element of `l` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the value `'H'`.***
