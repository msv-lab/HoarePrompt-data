The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `count_north` equals `count_south` + 1 (if `s[i]` is 'S') or `count_north - 1` (if `s[i]` is 'N'), `count_south` is `count_north - 1` (if `s[i]` is 'N'), `count_east` equals `count_west`, `result` is a list containing either 'H' or 'R', `i` is 1, and the current value of `s[i]` is either 'N' or 'S'.**
