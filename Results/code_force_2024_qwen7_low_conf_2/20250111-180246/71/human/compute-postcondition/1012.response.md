`r` is incremented by 1, changing its value from whatever it was previously to `r + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` is a list where the value at index 1 is `-1`, `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers respectively, and `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` is a list where the value at index 1 is `-1`, `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers respectively, and `r` is `r + 1`.**
