`ee` is decremented by 1. The value of `ee` could be either odd or even, which affects the values of `h` and `r`, as well as `pp`. Since the original value of `ee` was odd or even, subtracting 1 will change its parity (if it was odd, it becomes even, and vice versa). Therefore, `h` and `r` will switch their values, and `pp` will also switch from `['H']` to `'R'` or vice versa.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', `h` is increased by 1 depending on the new parity of `ee`, `r` is increased by 1 depending on the new parity of `ee`, `ee` is decreased by 1, `pp` contains either 'R' or ['H'] based on the new parity of `ee`, and the condition `(ee)` retains its truth value.**
