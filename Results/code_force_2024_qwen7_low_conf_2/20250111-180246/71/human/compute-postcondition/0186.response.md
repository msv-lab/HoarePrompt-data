Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', and `i` is not 'N', 'W', or 'E'. The condition `(ss)` is false. If the first element of `rr` is 0, then `pp` contains the value `'R'`. Otherwise, if `(hh[0])` is true, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is ['H']. If `r` is less than `h + 1`, then `rr[1]` is True and `pp` is ['R']. Otherwise, `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains as ['H']**
