`ss` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `ss` is `False`, which is equivalent to `0`. Subtracting 1 from `0` results in `-1`, which is still `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is either 1 or 2, `h` is either 1 or 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
