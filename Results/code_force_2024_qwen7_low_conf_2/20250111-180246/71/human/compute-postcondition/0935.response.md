`rr[0]` is decremented by 1. Since `rr[0]` was initially `True`, which in Python is equivalent to `1`, after decrementing, `rr[0]` will become `0`. The states of the other variables (`l`, `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'N' and is not 'S', `rr[0]` is 0**
