`pp` is a list that gets appended with the value `'R'`. The initial state of `l`, `i`, `ww % 2 == 1`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, `r`, `hh` remains unchanged. After appending `'R'` to `pp`, the value of `pp` becomes `[i, 'R']` since `i` is the next element in the list `l`. The other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is `[i, 'R']`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` is a list with its fourth element decreased by 1, `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`, `hh` and `ee` and `nn` and `rr` and `hh` remain unchanged.**
