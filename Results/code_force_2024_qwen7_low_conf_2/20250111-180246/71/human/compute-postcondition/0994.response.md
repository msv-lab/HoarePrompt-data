The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The list `pp` did not exist before, so it is initialized with the string `'H'`. The other variables and their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, and `h` is increased by 1.**
