Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `ww` is False, and `rr[3]` remains False. If `hh[3]` is 1, then `pp` contains the value `'H'`. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `h`, `rr[2]` is one more than its original value, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element 'R'. Otherwise, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].**
