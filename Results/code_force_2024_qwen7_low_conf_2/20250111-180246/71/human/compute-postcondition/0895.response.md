`h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `h` is not specified. The values of `l`, `i`, and `nn` remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `nn` is false, and `h` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `nn` is false, `h` is increased by 1**
