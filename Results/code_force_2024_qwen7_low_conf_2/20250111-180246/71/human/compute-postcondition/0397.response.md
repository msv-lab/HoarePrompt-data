`w` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `w` was 0, so now `w` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 0, `s` is 0, `w` is 1, `e` is 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ww` is 0, `ee` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, and the character `i` is 'W'.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `s` is 0, `w` is 1, `e` is 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ww` is 0, `ee` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, and the character `i` is 'W'**
