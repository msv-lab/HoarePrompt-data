The code snippet appends the string 'R' to the list `result`. Since `result` was a list containing either 'H', 'R', or a combination of these based on the value of `s[2]`, appending 'R' to it will update the list.

Given the initial conditions:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \)
- \( s \) is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length \( n \)
- \( count_north \) and \( count_south \) satisfy the condition where:
  - `count_north` equals `count_south + 1` (if `s[2]` is 'S')
  - `count_north` equals `count_south - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N')
- `count_south` is `count_north - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N') or `count_north`
- `count_east` and `count_west` satisfy the condition where:
  - `count_east` equals `count_west`
- `result` is a list containing either 'H', 'R', or a combination of these based on the value of `s[2]`
- `i` is 3

After executing the line `result.append('R')`, the list `result` will have the value of its previous elements plus 'R'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \); `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`; `count_north` and `count_south` satisfy the condition where `count_north` equals `count_south + 1` (if `s[2]` is 'S') or `count_south - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N'); `count_south` is `count_north - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N') or `count_north`; `count_east` and `count_west` satisfy the condition where `count_east` equals `count_west`; `result` is a list containing either 'H', 'R', or a combination of these based on the value of `s[2]` with 'R' appended; `i` is 3**
