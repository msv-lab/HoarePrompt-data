The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string 'R' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be an empty list before this operation. After appending 'R', `pp` becomes `['R']`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is ['R']**
