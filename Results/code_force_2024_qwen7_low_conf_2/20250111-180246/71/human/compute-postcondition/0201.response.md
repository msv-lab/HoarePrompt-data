The code snippet `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it must be a new list created by this operation. The initial state does not provide any information about `pp`, so after appending `'R'`, `pp` becomes `[ 'R' ]`.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is [ 'R' ]**
