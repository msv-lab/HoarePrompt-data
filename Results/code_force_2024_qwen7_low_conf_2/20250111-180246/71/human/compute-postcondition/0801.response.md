Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is 2 if `i` is 'N', and 1 if `i` is not 'N'. If `i` is 'S', `s` is 3; otherwise, `s` is 2. `w` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'W'; otherwise, `e` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'E'. `w` is 2 if `i` is 'W', and 1 otherwise, `e` is 2 if `i` is 'E', and 0 otherwise if `i` is not 'W' and not 'E', and `i` is the next element in the list `l`.***
