Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively. If `ss` is true, then `pp` is a list containing either one additional element `'R'` or the initial state plus `'H'`, and `h` is `h + 1` if the else part executed. Otherwise, if `rr[0]` is true, then `r` is increased by 1, `hh` is a list where its first element is decremented by 1 and `hh[0]` is true, and `hh` and `rr` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively. If `rr[0]` is false, then `pp` is a list containing its previous elements plus `'H'` if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise `pp` remains unchanged. Additionally, `hh` is a list where its first element is decreased by 1 if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise the first element of `hh` is increased by 1. If `hh[0]` is true, `h` is incremented by 1 based on `ww % 2 == 1`. If `hh[0]` is false, if `r < h`, then `pp` has an additional element `'R'` and `rr[1]` is increased by 1, otherwise `hh[1]` is increased by 1 and `h` is set to `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`.***
