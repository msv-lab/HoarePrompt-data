`nn` is decremented by 1. The initial conditions are that `nn` is odd (since it was odd and now it is decremented by 1, it will become even), `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E'. Since `nn` is now even, the conditions change to `nn` being even, `h` being 1, and `pp` being ['H']. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E'; `nn` is even; `h` is 1; `pp` is ['H']**
