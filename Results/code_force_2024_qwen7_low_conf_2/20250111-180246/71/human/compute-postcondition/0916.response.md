The value of `h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `h` is not specified. The other variables (`l` and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list with its first element incremented by 1, `i` is 'N', and `h` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list with its first element incremented by 1, `i` is 'N', and `h` is increased by 1**
