Postcondition: ***`hh[0]` is decremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains `'H'` if `hh[0]` is true. Otherwise, the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed. If `r < h`, then `rr[1]` is incremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains as a list containing the element 'R'. Otherwise, `hh[1]` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` becomes `['H']`.***
