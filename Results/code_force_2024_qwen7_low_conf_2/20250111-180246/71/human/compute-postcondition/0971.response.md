`h` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `h`, we only know that `h` was initially in a state where `ww % 2 == 1` determined its value, and now it is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `hh` is a list with the value at index 3 decremented by 1, and `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively; `h` is increased by 1.**
