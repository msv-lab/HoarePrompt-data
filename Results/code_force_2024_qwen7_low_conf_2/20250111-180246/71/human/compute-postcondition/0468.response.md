Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` because `w <= e`, `ee` is either `0` or `e - w` because `w <= e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `1`, `h` is `0`, `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and ww % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0` is true, `rr` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `pp` is an empty list `[]`, and `i` is 'W'. If `rr[3]` is `0`, then `r` is `1`, `h` is `0`, and the lists `rr` and `hh` remain unchanged, `pp` remains as `['R']`, and `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and ww % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0` is true. If `rr[3]` is not `0`, then `r` is `0` or `1`, `h` is `0` or `1`, `rr` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]` if `r < h` or `[0, 0, 0, 0]` otherwise, `hh` is `[0, 0, 1, 0]` if `r < h` or `[0, 0, 0, 1]` otherwise, `pp` is `['R']` if `r < h` or `['H']` otherwise, and `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and ww % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0` is false.***
