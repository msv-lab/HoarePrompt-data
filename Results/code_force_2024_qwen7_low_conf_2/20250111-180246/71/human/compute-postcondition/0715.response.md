`pp` is appended with the value 'R', which means `pp` now contains the value 'R'. The condition for the loop to continue executing at least one more time remains unchanged, and `r` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `r` is incremented by 1, `pp` contains 'R'**
