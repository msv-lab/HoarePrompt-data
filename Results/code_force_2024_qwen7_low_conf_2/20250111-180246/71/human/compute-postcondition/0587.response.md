`h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `hh[3]` being `hh[3] - 1` indicates that the value of `hh[3]` was already decremented before this code snippet. The variable `h` gets its new value, but the value of `hh[3]` remains unchanged from its previous decrement operation.

Output State: **`hh[3]` is `hh[3] - 1`; `h` is `h + 1`**
