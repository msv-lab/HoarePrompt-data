The code `pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the updated state of `pp` is that it contains the additional element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is incremented by 1, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list containing the elements of its original state plus `'R'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.**
