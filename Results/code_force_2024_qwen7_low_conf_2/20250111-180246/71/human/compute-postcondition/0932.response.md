`ss` is decremented by 1. Since the initial value of `ss` was an odd number, the condition for incrementing `r` and modifying `pp` is met. After decrementing, `ss` becomes even, which means the condition for setting `h` to 1 and setting `pp` to ['H'] is now met instead. However, since the decrement happens first, `r` will still be increased by 1 and `pp` will still be a list containing all its original elements plus the new element 'R'. 

Therefore, the updated states are:
- `r` is increased by 1.
- `pp` is a list containing all its original elements plus the new element 'R'.
- `ss` becomes even, leading to the condition where `h` is set to 1 and `pp` is set to ['H'].

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'S', `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing all its original elements plus the new element 'R', `h` is 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `ss` is even.**
