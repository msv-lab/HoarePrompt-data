Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-2`, `count_north`, `count_west`, and `count_south` are updated based on the previous character processed. If the character `char` is 'S', then `count_south` is incremented by 1. If the character `char` is 'E', then `count_east` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count_west` is increased by 1.***
