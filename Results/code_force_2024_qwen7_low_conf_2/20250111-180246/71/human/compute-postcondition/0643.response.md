The code `r += 1` increments the value of the variable `r` by 1. Since the initial value of `r` is part of the preconditions, we need to update this value.

From the initial state, we know that `r` is one of the variables involved, but its specific value is not explicitly stated. However, the code directly modifies `r`, so we can denote the new value of `r` as `r + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged according to the given code snippet.

Output State: **`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r` is `r + 1`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp`**
