Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Given Information:
- `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\).
- `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`.
- `count_north` is 0.
- `count_south` is 0.
- `count_east` is 0.
- `count_west` is 0.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for char in s:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute if and only if `s` is a non-empty string (i.e., `len(s) > 0`).

2. **Initial States:**
   - `n` is already given as an integer between 1 and \(2 \cdot 10^5\).
   - `s` is a string of length `n` containing characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'.
   - `count_north`, `count_south`, `count_east`, and `count_west` are all initialized to 0.

3. **Adjustments Needed:**
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `s`, `s` must be a non-empty string for the loop to execute. This means `n` must be greater than 0 (since `len(s) = n`).

### Final State Adjustment:
- We need to ensure that `s` is a non-empty string, which translates to ensuring that `n` is greater than 0.

### Final Answer:
State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` is 0, `count_south` is 0, `count_east` is 0, `count_west` is 0**
