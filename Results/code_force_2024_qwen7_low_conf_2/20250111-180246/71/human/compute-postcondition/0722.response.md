`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The other variables `l`, `rr[1]`, and `r` are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `rr[1]` is `rr[1] - 1`; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list with the additional element `'R'` appended**
