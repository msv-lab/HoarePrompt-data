`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. Since `i` is the next element in the list `l`, the value of `i` does not change. The initial state of `r`, `ww % 2 == 1`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` contains the string `'H'` appended to its previous elements, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively; `h` is incremented by 1.
