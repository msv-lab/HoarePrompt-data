The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The value of `pp` is not specified in the initial state, so we assume it is an empty list initially. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `nn`, `rr`, `r`, and `h`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', (not `nn`), (not `rr[1]`), `r` is one more than its original value but still less than `h`, `rr[0]` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing `'R'`**
