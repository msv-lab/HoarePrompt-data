`h` is incremented by 1, which means the value of `h` increases by 1. All other variables remain unchanged from their previous states.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`, `hh[0]` is reduced by 1, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`, `h` is increased by 1.**
