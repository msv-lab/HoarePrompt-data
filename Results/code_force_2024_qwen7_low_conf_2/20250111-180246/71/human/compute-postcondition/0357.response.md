`ss` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `ss` is `False`. Subtracting 1 from `False` in a boolean context results in `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 1 or 2, `rr` is one of [0, False, 1, False], [1, False, 1, False], or [-1, False, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is `True`, `pp` is one of ['R', 'R'], ['H', 'R'], ['R', 'H', 'R'], ['R', 'H'], or ['H', 'H'] based on the values of `r` and `h`, and `i` is 'E'.
