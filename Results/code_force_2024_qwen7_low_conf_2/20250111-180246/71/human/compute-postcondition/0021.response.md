`count_east` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` is updated based on the new character, `count_south` is updated based on the new character, `count_east` is incremented if the new character is 'E', `count_west` is incremented if the new character is neither 'S' nor 'E'. The value of `count_east` is increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` is updated based on the new character, `count_south` is updated based on the new character, `count_east` is incremented by 1 if the new character is 'E', `count_west` is incremented if the new character is neither 'S' nor 'E'.**
