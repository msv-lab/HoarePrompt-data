You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: The overall state of the program after the if-else block executes depends on the current character `i`:

- If `i == 'W'`:
  - `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` remain unchanged unless the following conditions are met:
    - If `ww` is true and `ww % 2 == 1`, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
    - If `ww` is true and `ww % 2 == 0`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['H']`.
    - If `ww` is false, then:
      - `rr[3]` is decremented by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R' if `rr[3]` was initially true.
      - If `rr[3]` is false, then `hh[3]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list with an additional element `'H'` if `hh[3]` is true.
      - If `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains 'R'.
      - If `r >= h`, then `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, and `h` is increased by 1.

- If `i == 'E'` and `ee` is even:
  - `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` remain as specified in the initial state, and:
    - If `rr[2] > 0`, then `rr[2]` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains a list containing at least one element, which is `'R'`.
    - If `hh[2]` is true, then `hh[2]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.
    - If neither condition holds, then `hh[2]` is false, `r < h`, and `rr` is updated to `[a, b, c, d + 2]`, and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
    - If all previous conditions fail, then `hh[3]` is incremented by 1, and all other variables (`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`) are incremented by 1, and the initial values of `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are restored.

- If `i == 'E'` and `ee` is not even:
  - The overall state of the program remains consistent with the preconditions unless:
    - If the next character `i` is 'N' and `nn` is non-empty (`['H']`), then `r` and `pp` remain unchanged, and `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `hh`, `rr`, `hh` remain as specified in the initial state.
    - If the next character `i` is 'N' and `nn` is empty, then `rr[1]` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and if `hh[1]` is `True`, then `hh[1]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` becomes a list containing `'H'`.
    - If the next character `i` is 'N' and `hh[1]` is `False`, then either `rr[0]` is `initial_value + 1` or `hh[0]` is `val + 1`, `r` is `initial_value + 2` or `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` becomes a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'`.
    - If the next character `i` is 'S' and `ss` is `True`, then `ss` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1. The value of `pp` becomes `['h + 1', 'rr', 'hh', 'pp', 'H']`.
    - If the next character `i` is 'S' and `ss` is `False`, then the values of `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` remain the same as the preconditions.
```
for i in l:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
