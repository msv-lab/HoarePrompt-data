Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `pp` is a list containing its previous elements plus `'H'` if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise `pp` remains unchanged. `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `h`, and `pp` when `i == 'W'`. `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers with its first element decreased by 1 if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise the first element of `hh` is increased by 1. `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively. If `hh[0]` is true, `h` is incremented by 1 based on `ww % 2 == 1`. If `hh[0]` is false, if `r < h`, then `pp` has an additional element `'R'` and `rr[1]` is increased by 1, otherwise `hh[1]` is increased by 1 and `h` is set to `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`.***
