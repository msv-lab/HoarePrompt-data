`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The value of `l`, `i`, `rr[0]`, `rr[1]`, and `r` are unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'N' and is not 'S', the first element of `rr` is False, `rr[1]` is the initial value of `rr[1]` + 1, and the value of `r` is less than `h` + 1; `pp` is a list with an additional element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'N' and is not 'S', the first element of `rr` is False, `rr[1]` is the initial value of `rr[1]` + 1, and the value of `r` is less than `h` + 1; `pp` is a list with an additional element `'R'`**
