Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'. If the current character in `s` is 'N', then `count_north` is 2. Otherwise, `count_north` remains 0. If the current character is 'S', then `count_south` is set to 2. If the current character is 'E', then `count_east` is incremented by 1. If the current character is neither 'S' nor 'E', then `count_west` is incremented by 1. Both `count_north` and `count_south` cannot be set simultaneously, and `count_east` and `count_west` cannot be incremented simultaneously.***
