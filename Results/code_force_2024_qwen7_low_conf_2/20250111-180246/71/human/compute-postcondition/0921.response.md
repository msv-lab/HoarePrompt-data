Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N'. If `nn` was initially true and odd, then `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'R', `h` remains unchanged, and `nn` is one less than its initial value. If `nn` was initially false, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'H', and `nn` is one less than its initial value. If `rr[1]` is 0, then `r` is `r_val + 1`, `pp` is a list containing elements equal to ['R'], and `h` remains unchanged. If `hh[1]` is 0, then `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing at least one element including 'H'. If `r < h` holds true, then `pp` is a list containing its original elements plus 'R', `r` is incremented by 1, and `r < h` still holds. Otherwise, the first element of `l` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the value 'H'.***
