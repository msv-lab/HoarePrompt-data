`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The initial state shows that `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is neither 'N' nor 'S', the first element of `hh` is 1, and the first element of `rr` is False. The value of `pp` is not specified in the initial state, so it is assumed to be an empty list initially. After appending `'H'` to `pp`, `pp` becomes a list containing `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'N' and is not 'S', the first element of `hh` is 1, the first element of `rr` is False, `pp` is ['H']**
