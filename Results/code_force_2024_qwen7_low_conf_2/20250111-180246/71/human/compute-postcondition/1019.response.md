`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is either 1 or 2 depending on the initial value of `ww % 2 == 1`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` is a list containing boolean values and integers where the first element is increased by 1, and `hh` is a list containing boolean values; `pp` now contains the string `'R'`.
