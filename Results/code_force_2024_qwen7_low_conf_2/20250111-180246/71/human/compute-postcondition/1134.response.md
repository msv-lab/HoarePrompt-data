`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The other variables are not directly affected by this operation. However, the conditions involving `r` and the adjustments to `pp`, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` based on `i` remain unchanged since no direct assignment or calculation involving these variables is performed.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is incremented by 1, `pp` contains one additional element `'R'`, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`, and `rr[1]` is incremented by 1.**
