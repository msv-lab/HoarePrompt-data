Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is a string. If `i` equals 'W', `l` remains unchanged, and `r`, `pp`, and `h` are updated according to the initial state of `ww % 2 == 1` and `rr[3]`:
- If `ww` is initially true, `r` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial state of `ww % 2 == 1`, `pp` is `['H']` if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was true and `['R']` if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was false, and `h` is 1 if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was true and unchanged if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was false.
- If `ww` is initially false, `r` is 0, `pp` is `['R']` if `rr[3]` is true and `['H']` if `rr[3]` is false. If `rr[3]` is false, then `hh[3]` is 1.
- Depending on the value of `r` compared to `h`, `rr[2]` or `hh[2]` is incremented, and `pp` is updated accordingly.
If `i` is 'E' and `ee` is true, `h` is increased by 1 if the new parity of `ee` is odd, `r` is increased by 1 if the new parity of `ee` is even, `ee` is decreased by 1, `pp` is either 'R' or ['H'] based on the new parity of `ee`, and the condition `(ee)` retains its truth value.
If `i` is 'E' and `ee` is false, `r` is increased by 1 if `rr[2]` is False, `pp` is ['R'] in this case. If `hh[2]` is True, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`.
If `i` is 'N' and `nn` was initially true and odd, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'R', `h` remains unchanged, and `nn` is one less than its initial value.
If `i` is 'N' and `nn` was initially false, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'H', and `nn` is one less than its initial value.
If `i` is 'N' and `rr[1]` is 0, then `r` is `r_val + 1`, `pp` is a list containing 'R', and `h` remains unchanged.
If `i` is 'N' and `hh[1]` is 0, then `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains 'H'.
If `r < h` holds true and the first element of `rr` is not True, `pp` includes the additional element 'R'.
Otherwise, the first element of `l` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the value 'H'.
If `i` is any string other than 'N', `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing either:
- All its original elements plus the new element 'R' (if `ss` is even).
- The element 'R' (if the first element of `rr` is True).
- The element 'H' (if the first element of `hh` is 1).
Additionally, if `r < h` and the first element of `rr` is not True, `pp` includes the additional element 'R'. If `r >= h` and the first element of `hh` is not 1, `h` is incremented by 1.***

This postcondition covers all possible cases for the string `i` within the if-else block and the resulting states of the variables `r`, `pp`, and `h` after the execution of the block.
