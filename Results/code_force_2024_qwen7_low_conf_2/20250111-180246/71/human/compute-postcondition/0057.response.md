`count_west` is decremented by 1. Given that `count_west` was initially equal to `count_east`, and both `count_north` and `count_south` are equal to each other, the initial conditions remain unchanged except for `count_west`. The value of `n` and the contents of the string `s` are also unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `count_north` equals `count_south` and `count_east` equals `count_west`, `count_west` is decreased by 1, `result` is a list containing 'H', `i` is 1, `s[1]` is either 'N' or 'S'**
