You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for understanding the program state at the start of the for loop. You will be provided with the program state after the previous iteration, which you need to modify. You will also see the for loop statement. Please do not make any assumptions. You must adhere to the text format: State: **state**.
I am giving you 2 examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.



Example 1:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 10, `i` is 3, `n` must be  greater than 3.
```
for i in range(n):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. At the for the i is increased by 1 so i is 4 and for the loop to execute again n must be greater than 4.
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is 4, `n` must be  greater than 4**

Example 2:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1 
```
for index, student in enumerate(students_list):
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?


Example Answer:
According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the student_list.  If the list has at least 3 students the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, students_list has at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list, index is 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time the list must have at least 3 students and the index is 2 and student is the trird student in the list.
State: **`total` is 0, students_list is a list of students that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list, index is 3**


Your Task:
State at the end of the previous iteration: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`, and `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are boolean variables and lists respectively. If `i == 'W'`:
- If `ww` is initially odd, `r` is `r-1`, `pp` contains the elements of the original `pp` plus `'H'`. If `ww` is initially even, `r` is `r+1`, `pp` contains the elements of the original `pp` plus `'R'`. If `ww` is initially odd and `rr[3]` is true, then `pp` is `[i, 'R']` and `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`. If `ww` is initially even and `rr[3]` is false, then `pp` remains unchanged and includes `'R'` if `r < h` and `hh[3]` is false, or updates to include `'H'` and `h` is incremented by 1 if `hh[3]` is true. `ee` and `nn` remain unchanged, `rr` is a list with its fourth element decreased by 1, and `hh` is a list with its third element possibly incremented by 1.
- If `i == 'E'`:
  - If `ee` is true, `pp` contains an additional element `'R'` if `ee % 2 == 1` or `'H'` otherwise, and `r` and `h` are updated based on the new value of `ee % 2`. If `ee` is false, if `rr[2]` is true, `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains an additional element `'R'`, and `hh`, `ee`, and `nn` remain unchanged. If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1. If `r < h`, then `r` is set to the initial value of `ww % 2 == 1` plus 1 and `pp` contains the string `'R'`. If `r >= h`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains the string `'H'`.
- If `i == 'N'`:
  - If `nn % 2 == 1` was True, then `pp` is `['R']`; otherwise, `pp` is `['H']`.
  - If `rr[1]` is true, then `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[1]` is decreased by 1, and the last element of `pp` is `'H'`.
  - If `r < h`, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1. If `r >= h`, the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and `pp` includes the string `'H'`.
- If `i == 'S'`:
  - If `ss` is true, `pp` may contain an additional element `'R'` or `'H'`, and `h` is incremented by 1 if the else part executed.
  - If `rr[0]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `hh` is a list where its first element is decremented by 1 and `hh[0]` is true, and `hh` and `rr` remain lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.
  - If `rr[0]` is false, `pp` may contain an additional element `'H'` if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise `pp` remains unchanged. `hh` is a list where its first element is decreased by 1 if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise the first element of `hh` is increased by 1. If `hh[0]` is true, `h` is incremented by 1 based on `ww % 2 == 1`. If `hh[0]` is false, if `r < h`, then `pp` has an additional element `'R'` and `rr[1]` is increased by 1, otherwise `hh[1]` is increased by 1 and `h` is set to `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`.

for i in l:
    # the loop body is omit
```
Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time?
