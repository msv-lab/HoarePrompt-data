To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the information provided and analyze the loop condition.

Given:
- `t` is the number of iterations of the loop.
- The loop runs for each value of `_` in the range from 0 to `t-1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n`, `s`, `w`, `e` are the counts of 'N', 'S', 'W', and 'E' in the string `l`.
- `nn` and `ss` are the final values derived from the comparison between `n` and `s`.
- `ww` is either `w - e` or `0` depending on the condition `w > e`.
- `ee` is either `0` or `e - w` depending on the same condition `w > e`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `l` is the input string.
- `r` and `h` are the final counts of 'R' and 'H' derived from the loop.
- `rr` and `hh` are updated lists based on the conditions during the loop.
- `pp` is the final list containing the sequence of 'R' and 'H'.
- If both `r` and `h` are True and at least one of `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, or `ee` is odd, the function prints `pp`; otherwise, the function prints 'NO'.

For the loop to execute one more time:
1. The variable `_` should be increased by 1.
2. The condition `t > _` must hold true.

Given that `_` is the loop counter and starts from 0, it needs to be incremented to `1` for the next iteration, and the condition `t > 1` must hold true.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
- `_` is increased to 1, and `t` must be greater than 1.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1**
