`pp` is a list that does not exist in the initial state. The code appends the string `'R'` to `pp`. Since `pp` did not exist initially, it is created and contains only `'R'`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is `r + 1` (less than `h`), and `rr` has its value at index 3 unchanged; `pp` is ['R'].

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is `r + 1` (less than `h`), and `rr` has its value at index 3 unchanged; `pp` is ['R']**
