Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list. If `ww` is initially odd, `r` is `r-1`, `pp` contains the elements of the original `pp` plus `'H'`. If `ww` is initially even, `r` is `r+1`, `pp` contains the elements of the original `pp` plus `'R'`. If `ww` is initially odd and `rr[3]` is true, then `pp` is `[i, 'R']` and `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`. If `ww` is initially even and `rr[3]` is false, then `pp` remains unchanged and includes `'R'` if `r < h` and `hh[3]` is false, or updates to include `'H'` and `h` is incremented by 1 if `hh[3]` is true. `ee` and `nn` remain unchanged, `rr` is a list with its fourth element decreased by 1, and `hh` is a list with its third element possibly incremented by 1.***
