`pp` is appended with the value 'R', which means `pp` now contains the element 'R'. The value of `rr[3]` is updated to `rr[3] - 1`, and the variable `r` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`rr[3]` is `rr[3] - 1`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'R'**
