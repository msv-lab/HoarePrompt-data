`s` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `s` is 2 if `i` is 'S', and 1 otherwise. After the increment, if `i` was 'S', the new value of `s` will be 3, and if `i` was not 'S', the new value of `s` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is 2 if `i` is 'N', and 1 if `i` is not 'N', `s` is 3 if `i` is 'S', and 2 otherwise, `w` is 2 if `i` is 'W', and 1 otherwise, `e` is 2 if `i` is 'E', and 0 otherwise, and `i` is the next element in the list `l`**
