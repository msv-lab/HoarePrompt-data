In the given state, the `hh` list is `[False, False, 0, False]`. The code snippet `hh[3] += 1` increments the value at index 3 of the `hh` list by 1. 

Initially, `hh[3]` is `False`, which is equivalent to `0`. Incrementing `0` by `1` results in `1`. Therefore, `hh[3]` changes to `1`.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, 1], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
