`pp` is a list that has an element appended to it. The element being appended is 'R'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `pp` now includes the element 'R'.

Output State: **`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r` is increased by 1, `h`, `rr[0]` is `v - 1`, `rr[1]`, ..., `rr[-1]` are the same as before; `pp` is `['R']`.**
