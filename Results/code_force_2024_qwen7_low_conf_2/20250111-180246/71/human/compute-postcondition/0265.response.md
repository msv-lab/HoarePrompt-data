The code snippet `rr[0] -= 1` decrements the value of `rr[0]` by 1. Given the initial state, let's update the value of `rr[0]`.

### Initial State:
- `l` is "WEN"
- `ww` is 3
- `r` is 1
- `h` is 1
- `rr` is [0, False, 1, False]
- `hh` is [False, False, 0, False]
- `ee` is 0
- `nn` is 2
- `ss` is False

### Impact of the Code:
- `rr[0] -= 1` decrements the value of `rr[0]` by 1. The initial value of `rr[0]` is 0, so after the decrement, `rr[0]` becomes -1.

### Updated State:
- `l` remains "WEN"
- `ww` remains 3
- `r` remains 1
- `h` remains 1
- `rr` becomes [-1, False, 1, False]
- `hh` remains [False, False, 0, False]
- `ee` remains 0
- `nn` remains 2
- `ss` remains False

### Output State:
**`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [-1, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
