`r` is incremented by 1. The initial state mentions that `r` is less than `h`, so after incrementing `r` by 1, `r` is still less than `h`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', `r` is less than `h`, `rr` is a list where the fourth element is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', `r` is less than `h`, `rr` is a list where the fourth element is incremented by 1**
