Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is modified as follows: if `r < h`, then `pp` is the same list as before with an additional element `'R'`; otherwise, `pp` is a list with an additional element `'H'`. `h` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `rr[2]` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1. `r` is increased by 1 regardless of the condition.***
