Postcondition: ***`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` and `h` take specific values depending on the condition, `rr` and `hh` are lists based on `r` and `h`, `ee` is either 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is a list that could be modified based on initial values and `r`, `h`, and `nn`, and `i` is 'E'. If `nn % 2 == 1`, then `r` is 2 or 3 and `h` is 1 or 2, `pp` is modified accordingly, and `i` remains 'E'. Otherwise, `r` is 1 or 2 and `h` is 2 or 3, `pp` is modified based on its initial value, and `i` remains 'E'.***
