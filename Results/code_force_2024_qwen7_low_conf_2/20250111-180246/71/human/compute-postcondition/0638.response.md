`pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The initial state does not provide the specific value of `hh[0]` or the value of `h`, but it mentions that `hh[0]` is `val + 1` and `h` is increased by 1. The code does not affect these variables, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`hh[0]` is `val + 1`; `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`**
