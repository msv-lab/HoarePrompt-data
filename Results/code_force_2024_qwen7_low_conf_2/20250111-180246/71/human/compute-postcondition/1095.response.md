Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list (second last element). `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r` and `h`. `pp` is a list containing at least the original elements plus `'H'`. `h` is the original value of `h`. If `hh[2]` is true, then `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `pp` is either `[<initial content of pp>, 'R']` or the original list with `'H'` appended, and `h` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.***

This postcondition summarizes both the if and else parts of the block, considering the state changes and conditions specified.
