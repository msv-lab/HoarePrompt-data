Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', and `ww` is False. If `rr[3]` is True, the postcondition remains as described in the if part: `r` is 1, `pp` is `['R']`. If `rr[3]` is False, then `hh[3]` is 1, `pp` contains the value `'H'`. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `h`, `rr[2]` is one more than its original value, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element 'R'. Otherwise, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].***
