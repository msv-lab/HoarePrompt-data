`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. This operation does not affect the values of `l`, `i`, `ww`, `r`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr[1]`, `hh`, and `h`. The value of `rr[1]` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is now a list with an additional element `'R'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr[1]` is increased by 1, and `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers respectively; `r` is increased by 1.**
