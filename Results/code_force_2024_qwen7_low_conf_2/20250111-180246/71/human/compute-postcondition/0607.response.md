The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The initial state does not provide any information about the list `pp`, so before executing the code, `pp` could be an empty list or contain any other elements. After executing the code, `pp` will have one more element, which is `'R'`.

Output State: **`rr[2]` is decremented by 1; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing at least one element, which is `'R'`**
