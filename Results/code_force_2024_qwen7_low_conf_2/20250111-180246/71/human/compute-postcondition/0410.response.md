Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`. If `i` is 'N', then `n` is 2, and `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` remain 0. If `i` is 'S', then `s` is incremented by 1. If `i` is 'W', then `w` is set to 2. If `i` is 'E', then `e` is set to 2. All other variables (`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`) retain their original values or are reset accordingly.***
