`rr[0]` is decremented by 1. Since `rr` is a list and `rr[0]` was initially `True`, which in Python is treated as `1`, decrementing it by 1 results in `0`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W', and `i` is not equal to 'E', and the condition `(ss)` is false, and the first element of `rr` is 0**
