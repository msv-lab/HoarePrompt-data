The code initializes `count_west` to 0. This does not affect the values of `n`, `s`, `count_north`, `count_south`, or `count_east`. Therefore, the only change is in the initialization of `count_west`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^5, `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length n, `count_north` is 0, `count_south` is 0, `count_east` is 0, `count_west` is 0**
