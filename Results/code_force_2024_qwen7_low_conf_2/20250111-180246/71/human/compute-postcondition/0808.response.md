Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in `l`. If `n` is greater than `s`, then `nn` is `n - s` and `ss` is 0. Otherwise, `nn` is 0 and `ss` is `s - n`.***
