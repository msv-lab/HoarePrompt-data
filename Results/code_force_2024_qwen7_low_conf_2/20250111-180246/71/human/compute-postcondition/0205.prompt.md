You have been assigned the role of a program executor, responsible for simulating the execution of Python code. You will be provided with an initial state and a Python code snippet. You need to provide the output state after running the Python code based on the initial state. Please avoid describing how the program runs. When a variable has a specific value, use that specific value directly for calculations. If a return takes place makes sure to always mention that a value or variable has been returned at the output state. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Include all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.


Example1:
Initial State: `str` is a string
```
n = int(input())
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 1:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `str` is a string, `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **`str` is a string, `n` is an input integer**


Example2:
Initial State: variables can hold any values
```
i += 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 2:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `i` is increased by 1.
Output State: **variable `i` is increased by 1**


Example3:
Initial State: `n` is either 3 or 5
```
m = n + 1
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 3:
m is assigned the value n + 1. The value of n can be 3 or 5, so the value of m is 4 or 6. Therefore, the Output State is: n is either 3 or 5; m is either 4 or 6.
Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6**


Example4:
Initial State: `x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.
```
y = -z
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer : 
`y` is assigned the value of minus `z`, and if x is greater than 10 then z=0 else z=1.The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, if x is greater than 10 then z=0 and y =0 , else z=1 and y=-1**


Example 5:
Initial State: `total' is 0, `i` is 1
```
break
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 5: 
`The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is:  `total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`total' is 0, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**

Example 6:
Initial State: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is 0
```
x = total - num
```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.
Example Answer 6: 
`x' becomes total minus num. The value of `total` is positive, and the value of `num` is negative, so the value of `x` is a positive valye greater than total. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value `total` - `num.
Output State: **`total' is positive, `num` is negative, `x` is a positive value equal to `total` - `num'.**

Your Task:
Initial State: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial Conditions**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `l`. The initial conditions given are:
   - `l` is a non-empty string.
   - Depending on the value of `i` (the current character being processed), different operations are performed on `l`, `ww`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, and `hh`.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop processes each character in `l` sequentially. We need to determine the state of all relevant variables after the current character has been processed.

3. **Update Variables Based on Character**:
   - If `i` equals 'W':
     - `l` remains unchanged.
     - If `ww % 2 == 0`, `ww -= 1`.
     - If `ww % 2 == 0`, `r += 1`.
     - If `ww % 2 == 1`, `h += 1`.
   - If `i` does not equal 'W':
     - `l` remains unchanged.
     - If `i` equals 'E' and `ee == 0`, `r = 1`, `pp = ['R']`, `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`.
     - If `rr[2]` is False, `r = 1`, `pp = ['R']`.
     - If `hh[2]` is non-zero, `h += 1`, `pp = ['H']`, `hh[2] -= 1`.
     - If `hh[2]` is zero and `r < h`, `r += 1`, `hh[3]` remains unchanged.
     - If `r >= h`, `hh[3] += 1`, `h += 1`, `pp = ['H']`.
     - If `i` equals 'N' and `nn` is even, `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`, `r` remains unchanged.
     - If `i` equals 'N' and `nn` is odd, `h += 1`, `pp = ['H']`, `r += 1` if `r < h`, otherwise `r` remains unchanged.
     - If `i` equals 'S' and `ss` is true, `ss -= 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `h` remains unchanged, `pp = ['H']`.
     - If `i` equals 'S' and `ss` is false, based on the conditions of `rr` and `hh`, update `r`, `h`, and `pp` accordingly.

4. **Determine Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to continue, we need to ensure that the character `i` from the string `l` is processed and the resulting state of the variables is correct for the next iteration.

Given these steps, let's assume we are processing the first character of `l` and need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

### Example Analysis

Let's assume the initial state before entering the loop is:
- `l` is "WEN", `ww = 4`, `r = 0`, `h = 0`, `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`, `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`, `ee = 0`, `nn = 2`, `ss = True`.

#### Processing the First Character ('W'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'W', `ww -= 1` (so `ww = 3`).
- Since `ww % 2 == 1`, `h += 1` (so `h = 1`).
- `r` remains unchanged (`r = 0`).

The state after processing the first character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 0`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = True`.

For the next iteration, the first character is now 'E'.

### Updated State for Next Iteration

#### Processing the Second Character ('E'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'E' and `ee == 0`, `r = 1`, `pp = ['R']`, `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`.

The state after processing the second character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 1`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = True`.

For the next iteration, the first character is now 'N'.

### Updated State for Next Iteration

#### Processing the Third Character ('N'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'N' and `nn` is even (`nn = 2`), `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`, `r` remains unchanged (`r = 1`).

The state after processing the third character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 1`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = True`.

For the next iteration, the first character is now 'S'.

### Updated State for Next Iteration

#### Processing the Fourth Character ('S'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'S' and `ss` is true (`ss = True`), `ss -= 1` (so `ss = False`), `r` remains unchanged (`r = 1`), `h` remains unchanged (`h = 1`), `pp = ['H']`.

The state after processing the fourth character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 1`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = False`.

For the next iteration, the first character is now 'E'.

### Updated State for Next Iteration

#### Processing the Fifth Character ('E'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'E' and `ee == 0`, `r = 1`, `pp = ['R']`, `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`.

The state after processing the fifth character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 1`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = False`.

For the next iteration, the first character is now 'N'.

### Final State for Next Iteration

#### Processing the Sixth Character ('N'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'N' and `nn` is even (`nn = 2`), `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`, `r` remains unchanged (`r = 1`).

The state after processing the sixth character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 1`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = False`.

### Summary

State at the start of the next iteration: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**.
```
rr[2] += 1

```
Now, please think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result. You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state**.
Be as specific as possible. If a variable has a specific value or is equal to some combination of variables, use that specific value  or expression it is equal to. nclude all the information of the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed. Just update the values of the variables that have been changed by the code.
