The value of `w` is incremented by 1. Since `i` is the next character in `l`, and `l` is a non-empty string with one less character, the value of `i` is known, but the specific increment value for `w` is already set based on the condition when `i` is 'W'. Therefore, the value of `w` will be 3 if `i` was 'W', otherwise it will be 1 (if `i` was anything other than 'W').

The states of the other variables (`l`, `i`, `n`, `s`, and `e`) remain unchanged from the initial state because the code does not affect them.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is 2 if `i` is 'N', `s` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'S', `w` is 3 if `i` is 'W', `e` is 2 if `i` is 'E', and `w` is 1 if `i` is not 'W'.**
