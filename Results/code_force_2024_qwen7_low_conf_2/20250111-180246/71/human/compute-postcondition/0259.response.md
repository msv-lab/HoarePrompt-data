The code snippet `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given the initial state provided:

- `l` is "WEN"
- `ww` is 3
- `r` is 1
- `h` is 1
- `rr` is [0, False, 1, False]
- `hh` is [False, False, 0, False]
- `ee` is 0
- `nn` is 2
- `ss` is False

The value of `r` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `r` is `1 + 1 = 2`.

The state of all other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
