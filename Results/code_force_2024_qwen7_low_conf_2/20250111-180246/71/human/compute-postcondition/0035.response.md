Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5, `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `count_north` is the total number of 'N' in `s`, `count_south` is the total number of 'S' in `s`, `count_east` is the total number of 'E' in `s`, `count_west` is the total number of 'W' in `s`. The condition `count_north` is not equal to `count_south` or `count_east` is not equal to `count_west` holds true.***
