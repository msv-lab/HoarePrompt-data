Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', and `i` is not 'N', 'W', or 'E'. If `ss` is true, then `ss` is decremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, `h` remains unchanged, and `pp` is `['H']`. If `ss` is false, then `pp` is updated based on the following conditions: 
- If the first element of `rr` is 0, then `pp` contains the value `'R'`.
- If `(hh[0])` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` remains as `['H']`.
- If `r` is less than `h + 1`, then `rr[1]` is set to `True` and `pp` becomes `['R']`.
- Otherwise, `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains as `['H']`.***
