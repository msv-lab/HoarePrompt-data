Postcondition: ***`l` is a list with at least one more character, `r` is increased by 1 if `ee % 2 == 1`; otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1. The list `pp` contains either an additional element `'R'` or the element `'H'` depending on the condition. The loop can proceed with the next character in the list `l` if the conditions allow.***
