The code snippet appends the value 'H' to the list `result`. The previous state is as follows:

- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \)
- \( s \) is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length \( n \)
- \( count_north \) and \( count_south \) satisfy the condition where:
  - \( count_north \) equals \( count_south + 1 \) (if \( s[2] \) is 'S')
  - \( count_north \) equals \( count_south - 1 \) (if \( s[2] \) is 'N')
- \( count_south \) is \( count_north - 1 \) (if \( s[2] \) is 'N') or \( count_north \)
- \( count_east \) and \( count_west \) satisfy the condition where:
  - \( count_east \) equals \( count_west \)
- \( result \) is a list containing either 'H', 'R', or a combination of these based on the value of \( s[2] \)
- \( i \) is 3
- \( s[3] \) is either 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W'

After executing the code snippet `result.append('H')`, the value of `result` changes to include 'H'. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is:

**State: `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `count_north` and `count_south` satisfy the condition where `count_north` equals `count_south + 1` (if `s[2]` is 'S') or `count_south - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N'), `count_south` is `count_north - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N') or `count_north`, `count_east` and `count_west` satisfy the condition where `count_east` equals `count_west`, `result` is a list containing 'H' based on the value of `s[2]` followed by 'H', `i` is 3**
