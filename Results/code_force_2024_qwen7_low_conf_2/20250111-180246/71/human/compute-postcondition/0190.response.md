Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, and `i` is not equal to 'W'. If `i` is 'E', and `ee` is 0, then `r` is 1 and `pp` is ['R'], `h` is 1 and `pp` is ['H']. Otherwise, if `rr[2]` is False, `r` is 1 and `pp` is ['R']. If `hh[2]` is non-zero, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. If `hh[2]` is zero and `r < h`, then `r` is incremented by 1, and `hh[3]` remains unchanged. If `r` is not less than `h`, then `hh[3]` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['H']. If `i` is 'N' and `nn` is even, then `h` is 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `r` remains unchanged; if `nn` is odd, then `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `r` is increased by 1 if `r` is less than `h`; if `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, then `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `r` remains unchanged. If `i` is 'S' and `ss` is true, then `ss` is decremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, `h` remains unchanged, and `pp` is ['H']; if `ss` is false, then `pp` is updated based on the following conditions: 
- If the first element of `rr` is 0, then `pp` contains the value `'R'`.
- If `(hh[0])` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` remains as ['H'].
- If `r` is less than `h + 1`, then `rr[1]` is set to `True` and `pp` becomes ['R'].
- Otherwise, `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains as ['H'].***

This postcondition summarizes the state of all variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering all possible cases for the value of `i`.
