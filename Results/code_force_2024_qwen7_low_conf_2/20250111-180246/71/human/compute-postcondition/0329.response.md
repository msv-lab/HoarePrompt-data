Postcondition: ***`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `i` is 'E', `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False. `r` and `h` follow specific conditions based on the value of `ee`. If `ee` is 0, then `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 2 or 3, and `rr` is one of [0, False, 1, False], [1, False, 1, False], or [-1, False, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `pp` is one of ['R', 'H'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H', 'H']. If `ee` is -1, then `r` follows the value from the if part, `h` follows the value from the else part, `rr` is adjusted accordingly based on the value of `hh[2]` and `r` compared to `h`, and `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False]. `pp` is either ['R', 'H'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H', 'R'] if `r` is less than `h`, or ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H'] if `r` is greater than or equal to `h`.***
