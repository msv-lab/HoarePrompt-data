`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `nn` is true and `nn` is odd, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `nn` is true and `nn` is odd, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R']**
