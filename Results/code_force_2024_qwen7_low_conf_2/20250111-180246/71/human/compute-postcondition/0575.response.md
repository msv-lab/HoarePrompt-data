Postcondition: ***`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` are as follows:
- If the current character is 'W', `ww` is either `w - e - 1` or `0` depending on the condition `w > e`, `ee` is either `0` or `e - w` depending on the condition `w > e`. `r` is `1` if `ww % 2 == 1` and `ww` is not `0`, `r` is `0` if `ww % 2 == 0` and `ww` is not `0`. `h` is `0` if `ww % 2 == 1` and `ww` is not `0`, `h` is `1` if `ww % 2 == 0` and `ww` is not `0`. `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and ww % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0` may be true or false, `rr` is either `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, or `[0, 0, 0, 1]` depending on the value of `r` and `h`, `hh` is either `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, or `[0, 0, 0, 1]` depending on the value of `r` and `h`, `pp` is either `['H']` or `['R']` depending on the condition `ww % 2 == 0`.
- If the current character is 'E', `ee` is either `e - 1` and is odd, or `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`. `m` remains unchanged. `r` is `0` if `ee` is even, `1` if `ee` is odd and `r < h`, or `0` if `r >= h`. `h` is `1` if `r < h` and `h` was initially `0`, `2` if `r >= h` and `h` was initially `0`. `rr[2]` is `0` if `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and r % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0`, otherwise `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]` if `r < h` or a list of zeros otherwise. `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]` if `r < h` and `h` was initially `0`, or `[0, 0, 0, 2]` if `r >= h` and `h` was initially `0`. `pp` is `['R']` if `r < h` or `['H']` if `r >= h`.
- If the current character is 'N', `nn` is decremented by 1 and its parity is considered, updating `r`, `h`, `rr`, and `hh` accordingly.
- If the current character is 'S', `r` and `h` are determined based on the parity of `ss`, and `rr` and `hh` are updated accordingly.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of all variables after the execution of the if-else block based on the current character in the string `l`.
