Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', and (not `nn`), and (not `rr[1]`). If `hh[1]` is False, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is ['H']. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `h`, then `r` is one more than its original value but still less than `h`, `rr[0]` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing `'R'`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, then `hh[0]` is increased by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is `['H']`.***
