`h` is incremented by 1. The initial condition states that `h` is greater than or equal to r, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state of `h` is one more than its original value, while the other conditions and values remain the same.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', (not nn), (not rr[1]), and (r >= h + 1); hh[0] is increased by 1, `h` is incremented by 1**
