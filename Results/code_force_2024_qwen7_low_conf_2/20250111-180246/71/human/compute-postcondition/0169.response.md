`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The initial state specifies that `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N', 'W', or 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, and the first element of `rr` is 0; `r` is increased by 1, but there is no explicit value for `r` provided. Therefore, the only change is the addition of `'R'` to `pp`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `i` is not 'N', 'W', or 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, the first element of `rr` is 0, and `pp` contains the value `'R'`**
