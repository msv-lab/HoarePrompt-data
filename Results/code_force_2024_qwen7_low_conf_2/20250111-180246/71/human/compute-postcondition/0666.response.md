Postcondition: ***`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are as follows:
- If the next character `i` is 'N' and `nn` is non-empty (`['H']`), then `r` and `pp` remain unchanged, and `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `hh`, `rr`, `hh` remain as specified in the initial state.
- If the next character `i` is 'N' and `nn` is empty, then `rr[1]` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and if `hh[1]` is `True`, then `hh[1]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` becomes a list containing `'H'`.
- If the next character `i` is 'N' and `hh[1]` is `False`, then either `rr[0]` is `initial_value + 1` or `hh[0]` is `val + 1`, `r` is `initial_value + 2` or `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` becomes a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'`.
- If the next character `i` is 'S' and `ss` is `True`, then `ss` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1. The value of `pp` becomes `['h + 1', 'rr', 'hh', 'pp', 'H']`.
- If the next character `i` is 'S' and `ss` is `False`, then the values of `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` remain the same as the preconditions.***
