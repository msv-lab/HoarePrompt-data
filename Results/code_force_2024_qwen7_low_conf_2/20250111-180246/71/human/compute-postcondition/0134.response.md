`r` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `r` is not specified, but it is implied to be 0 since it is not mentioned otherwise. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', and (not nn), `r` is 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', and (not nn), `r` is 1**
