`m` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `_` remains 1, and the condition that `t` must be greater than 1 is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value**
