Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` and `h` represent different states based on the condition involving the parities of `nn`, `ss`, and `r`, `rr` and `hh` are lists updated based on the parities of `nn` and `ss`, and `pp` is either `['R']` or `['H']` based on the new parity of `nn`. If the current character is 'N', `nn` is decremented by 1 and its parity is considered, updating `r`, `h`, `rr`, and `hh` accordingly. If the current character is 'S', `r` and `h` are determined based on the parity of `ss`, and `rr` and `hh` are updated accordingly.***
