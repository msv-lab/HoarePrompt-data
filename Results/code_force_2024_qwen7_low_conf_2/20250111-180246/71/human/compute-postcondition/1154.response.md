The function `func` accepts the following parameters:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\). For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'. The sum of `n` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Based on the given output cases, the function will handle different scenarios for the string `s`:
- Case_1: The function processes the string `s` and returns a specific result based on the movement directions represented by 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'.
- Case_2: The function returns an error or specific message if the input does not meet the constraints.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept parameters `t`, `n`, and `s`, process the string `s` according to the movement directions, and return a specific result or error message based on the constraints and input validity.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `t`, `n`, and `s`, where `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'. It processes the string `s` and returns a result based on the movement directions represented by the characters in `s`, and handles invalid inputs by returning an error message.**
