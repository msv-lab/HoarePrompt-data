`hh[1]` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `hh[1]` is `True`, which in Python is equivalent to `1`. Therefore, after subtracting 1, `hh[1]` becomes `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'E' and the current value of `i` is 'N', `hh[1]` is 0**
