Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `count_north` and `count_south` satisfy the condition where `count_north` equals `count_south + 1` (if `s[2]` is 'S') or `count_south - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N'), `count_south` is `count_north - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N') or `count_north`, `count_east` and `count_west` satisfy the condition where `count_east` equals `count_west`, `result` is a list containing either 'H', 'R', or a combination of these based on the value of `s[2]`, and `i` is either 4 or 5 depending on whether `s[3]` is 'E' or 'W'.***
