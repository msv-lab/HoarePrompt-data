Postcondition: ***`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `i` is 'E', `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False. `r` and `h` follow specific conditions based on the value of `ee` and `nn`. If `ee` is 0, `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 2 or 3, and `rr` is one of [0, False, 1, False], [1, False, 1, False], or [-1, False, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], and `pp` is one of ['R', 'H'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H', 'H']. If `ee` is -1, `r` and `h` are adjusted based on the values of `hh[2]`, `r`, and `h`, and `rr` and `hh` are updated accordingly, while `pp` is either ['R', 'H'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H', 'R'] if `r` < `h`, or ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H'] if `r` ≥ `h`. If `nn` is 0, `r` is 2 or 3, `h` is 1 or 2, and `pp` is a list based on the initial values and `r`, `h`, and `nn`. If `nn` is 1, `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 2 or 3, and `pp` is a list based on the initial values and `r`, `h`, and `nn`. If `ss` is `True`, `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 1 or 2, and `pp` is one of ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H']. If `ss` is `False`, `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 1 or 2, and `pp` is one of ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H']. Otherwise, `r` and `h` are 1 or 2, and `pp` is one of [1, False, 1, False], [2, False, 1, False], or [0, False, 1, False] if `r` < `h`, or [1, False, 1, False], [2, False, 1, False], or [0, False, 1, False] if `r` ≥ `h`.***
