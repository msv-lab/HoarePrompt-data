`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The value of `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', `rr[2]` is False, and `r` is increased by 1. After appending `'R'` to `pp`, the value of `pp` becomes a list containing the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', `rr[2]` is False, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R']**
