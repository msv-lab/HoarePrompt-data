Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W', and `i` is not equal to 'E', and the condition `(ss)` is false, and `(rr[0])` is false, and `(hh[0])` is false. If `r` is less than `h + 1`, then `rr[1]` is True and `pp` is ['R']. Otherwise, `hh[1]` is increased by 1 and `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['H']***
