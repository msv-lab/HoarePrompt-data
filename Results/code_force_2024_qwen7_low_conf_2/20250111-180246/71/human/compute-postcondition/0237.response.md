The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given the previous state:

- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww` is 3.
- `r` is 1.
- `h` is 1.
- `rr` is [0, False, 1, False].
- `hh` is [False, False, 0, False].
- `ee` is 0.
- `nn` is 2.
- `ss` is False.

After executing `r += 1`, the value of `r` is incremented by 1, making `r` equal to 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**.
