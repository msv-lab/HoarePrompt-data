The code snippet `hh[2] += 1` increments the value at index 2 of the list `hh` by 1. Given the previous state:

- `l` is "WEN"
- `ww` is 3
- `r` is 1
- `h` is 1
- `rr` is [0, False, 1, False]
- `hh` is [False, False, 0, False]
- `ee` is 0
- `nn` is 2
- `ss` is False

The only change is to the value at index 2 of `hh`. Initially, `hh[2]` is 0. After incrementing it by 1, `hh[2]` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 1, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
