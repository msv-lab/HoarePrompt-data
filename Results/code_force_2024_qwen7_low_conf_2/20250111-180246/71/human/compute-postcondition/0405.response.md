`s` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` remains the next character in `l`, and the values of `n`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, and `ee` remain unchanged because no operation was performed on them. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is 1 or 0, `s` is `s` + 1, `w` is 1 or 0, `e` is 1 or 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ww` is 0, and `ee` is 0.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is 1 or 0, `s` is `s` + 1, `w` is 1 or 0, `e` is 1 or 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ww` is 0, and `ee` is 0.**
