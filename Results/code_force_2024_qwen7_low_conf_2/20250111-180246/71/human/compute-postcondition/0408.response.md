Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`. If `i` is 'W', then `w` is 2 and all other variables (`n`, `s`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ee`, `ww`) remain 0. If `i` is not 'W', then `e` is 2 and all other variables (`n`, `s`, `w`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`) remain 0.***
