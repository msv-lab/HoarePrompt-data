`pp` is a list that originally contains either `['R']`, `['H']`, or `['R', 'H']` based on the values of `r` and `h`. After executing `pp.append('H')`, the list `pp` will have an additional element `'H'`. Since the value of `h` determines whether `'R'` or `'H'` is already in the list, appending `'H'` ensures that `'H'` is present in the list. 

Therefore, the updated state of `pp` will be `['R', 'H']`, `['H', 'H']`, or `['R', 'H', 'H']` depending on the original contents of `pp`.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 2 or 3, `rr` is one of [0, False, 1, False], [1, False, 1, False], or [-1, False, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, True, 0, False], [1, True, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is one of ['R', 'H'], ['H', 'H'], or ['R', 'H', 'H'], `hh[1]` is True, `i` is 'E'**
