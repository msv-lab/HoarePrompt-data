Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively. If `r < h`, then `pp` has an additional element `'R'` and `rr[1]` is increased by 1, otherwise `hh[1]` is increased by 1 and `h` is `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`.**
