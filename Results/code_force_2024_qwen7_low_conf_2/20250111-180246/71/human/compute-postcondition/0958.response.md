Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, and `i` is a string. If `i` is 'E', then depending on the condition `ee`:
- If `ee` is true, `h` is increased by 1 if the new parity of `ee` is odd, `r` is increased by 1 if the new parity of `ee` is even, `ee` is decreased by 1, `pp` is either 'R' or ['H'] based on the new parity of `ee`, and the condition `(ee)` retains its truth value.
- If `ee` is false, `r` is increased by 1 if `rr[2]` is False, `pp` is ['R'] in this case. If `hh[2]` is True, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`. If `r` is less than `h`, `rr` is a list where the fourth element is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list with its last element being 'R'. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains 'H'.
If `i` is 'N', then:
- If `nn` was initially true and odd, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'R', `h` remains unchanged, and `nn` is one less than its initial value.
- If `nn` was initially false, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'H', and `nn` is one less than its initial value.
- If `rr[1]` is 0, then `r` is `r_val + 1`, `pp` is a list containing 'R', and `h` remains unchanged.
- If `hh[1]` is 0, then `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing at least one element including 'H'.
- If `r < h` holds true, then `pp` is a list containing its original elements plus 'R', `r` is incremented by 1, and `r < h` still holds.
- Otherwise, the first element of `l` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the value 'H'.
If `i` is any string other than 'N', then `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing either:
- All its original elements plus the new element 'R' (if `ss` is even).
- The element 'R' (if the first element of `rr` is True).
- The element 'H' (if the first element of `hh` is 1).
Additionally, if `r < h` and the first element of `rr` is not True, `pp` includes the additional element 'R'. If `r >= h` and the first element of `hh` is not 1, `h` is incremented by 1.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program variables after executing the if-else block, considering all possible conditions and outcomes.
