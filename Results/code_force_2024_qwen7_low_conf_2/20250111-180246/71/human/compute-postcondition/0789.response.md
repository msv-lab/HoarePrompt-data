`s` is incremented by 1. The value of `s` was initially dependent on the character `i`. Since `i` is the next element in the list `l`, and `s` is 1 if `i` is 'S' and 0 otherwise, the new value of `s` will depend on the value of `i`. If `i` was 'S' before, `s` was 1 and now it is 2. If `i` was not 'S', `s` was 0 and now it is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is 1 if `i` is 'N', and `n` is 0 otherwise, `s` is 2 if `i` is 'S' and 1 otherwise, `w` is 1 if `i` is 'W', and `w` is 0 otherwise, `e` is 1 if `i` is 'E', and `e` is 0 otherwise, and `i` is the next element in the list `l`.**
