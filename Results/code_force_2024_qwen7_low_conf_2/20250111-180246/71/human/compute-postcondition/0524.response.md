`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `pp`, we assume it is initially empty. After appending `'H'`, `pp` will contain `'H'`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged as the code snippet does not affect them.

Output State: **`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `0`, `h` is `1`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, the current character being processed is not 'N', and the if condition `(hh[1])` is false; `pp` contains `'H'`.**
