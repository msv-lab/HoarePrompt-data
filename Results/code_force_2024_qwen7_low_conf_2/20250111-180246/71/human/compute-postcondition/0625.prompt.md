You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing the overall postcondition of Hoare triples for if statements based on the postconditions of the if and the else part. In addition to the Hoare triples, you will also see the postconditions for the if and else parts. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This contains the condition of the if statement and if there is an else part there will also be an else: in the program fragment.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. You need to strictly follow the format and summarize the if statement in a coherent paragraph, rather than discussing it in separate paragraphs.

The if part : the postcondition of the if part

The else part : the postcondition of the else part

Combine the postconditions of the if and else part(if an else exists), taking into account the if condition,  to get the overall postcondition of the if else block

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
Program Fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```
If part: `str` is a string with lenght less than 3, the function returns None
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less then 3, the function return None***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
Program Fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    
else:
    
```

If part: n is an integer of any value and the function returns `n`
Else part: n can have any value except an integer one and the function returns `int(n)`

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***if `n` is integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function return `int(n)`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
Program Fragment:
```
if x < 2:
   
else:
    
```

If part: `x` is an positive integer less than 2, the function returns False
Else part: `x` is an positive integer larger or equal to 2 and the function returns True

Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer, if x is less then 2, the function return False. Otherwise, the function return True***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program Fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    
else:
    
```
if part: the integer n was originally negative and `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
else part: if n is 0 then return m , otherwise the integer `n` is decreased by 13. Integer `m` is increased by 1

Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, y is zero.
Program Fragment:
```
if x > 0:
```
If part: `x` is a positive integer, if `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If x is larger than 0 but lower than 10, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions and Loop Setup**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`.
   - Each element `i` in `l` represents a direction ('N', 'S', 'W', 'E').

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Variables like `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` are defined based on the conditions given.

3. **Loop Body Impact**:
   - Depending on the current character `i` (which is an element from `l`), different conditions and updates apply to the variables `ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp`.

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the next element `i` must be valid and the conditions for updating the variables must hold true.

Given the current state and the nature of the loop, let's consider the possible next iterations:

### Case Analysis Based on Current Character

#### Case 1: Current Character is 'W'
- If the current character is 'W':
  - `ww` changes based on the condition `w > e`.
  - `ee` changes based on the condition `w > e`.
  - `r` and `h` are updated based on the new values of `ww` and `ee`.
  - `rr` and `hh` are updated based on the values of `r` and `h`.
  - `pp` is updated based on the parity of `ww`.

For the loop to continue with 'W':
- `ww` must be either `w - e - 1` or `0` if `w > e`.
- `ee` must be either `0` or `e - w` if `w > e`.
- `r` must be `1` if `ww % 2 == 1` and `ww` is not `0`.
- `h` must be `0` if `ww % 2 == 1` and `ww` is not `0`.

#### Case 2: Current Character is 'E'
- If the current character is 'E':
  - `ee` changes based on the condition `w > e`.
  - `m` remains unchanged.
  - `r` and `h` are updated based on the new value of `ee`.
  - `rr` and `hh` are updated based on the values of `r` and `h`.
  - `pp` is updated based on the value of `r`.

For the loop to continue with 'E':
- `ee` must be odd if `w > e`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `r` must be `0` if `ee` is even.
- `h` must be updated based on the new values of `r` and `h`.

#### Case 3: Current Character is 'N'
- If the current character is 'N':
  - `nn` is decremented by 1.
  - `r` and `h` are updated based on the new value of `nn`.
  - `rr` and `hh` are updated based on the values of `r` and `h`.
  - `pp` is updated based on the parity of `nn`.

For the loop to continue with 'N':
- `nn` must be decremented by 1.
- `r` and `h` must be updated based on the new value of `nn`.

#### Case 4: Current Character is 'S'
- If the current character is 'S':
  - `r` and `h` are updated based on the parity of `ss`.
  - `rr` and `hh` are updated based on the values of `r` and `h`.
  - `pp` is updated based on the value of `r`.

For the loop to continue with 'S':
- `ss` must have its parity considered.
- `r` and `h` must be updated based on the parity of `ss`.
- `rr` and `hh` must be updated based on the new values of `r` and `h`.

### Conclusion

Since the next character `i` is an element of `l`, we need to ensure the conditions for the next character to be valid. Given the complexity, we need to ensure that the next character maintains the integrity of the conditions described.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- The specific values of `ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` depend on the current character `i`.
- The general conditions are that the next character must be a valid direction ('W', 'E', 'N', 'S') and the conditions for updating the variables must hold.

**State**: **`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` are as follows:
- If the next character `i` is 'W', the conditions for `ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are as described above.
- If the next character `i` is 'E', the conditions for `ee`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are as described above.
- If the next character `i` is 'N', the conditions for `nn`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are as described above.
- If the next character `i` is 'S', the conditions for `ss`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are as described above.

Thus, the state remains the same but with the conditions adjusted based on the next character `i`.
Program Fragment:
```
if nn % 2 == 1:
else:

```
if part: `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing the elements before the append operation plus the string `'R'`
else part: `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `hh + 1`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` is ['H']

Your task is to complete the overall postcondition of the whole if else block. Summarise all the cases and give the overall state of the program after the if else executes. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
