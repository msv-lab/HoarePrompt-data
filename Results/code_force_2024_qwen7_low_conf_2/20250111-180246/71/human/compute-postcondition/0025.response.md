Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'. If the new character is 'N', `count_north` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_north` is updated based on the new character, `count_east` is incremented if the new character is 'E', and `count_west` is incremented if the new character is neither 'S' nor 'E'. Additionally, if the new character is 'S', `count_south` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_south` is incremented by 1.***
