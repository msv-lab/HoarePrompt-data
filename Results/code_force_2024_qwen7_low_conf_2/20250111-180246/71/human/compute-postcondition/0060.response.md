Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `count_north` equals `count_south` and `count_east` equals `count_west`, `result` is a list containing either 'R' or 'H', `i` is 2, and `s[i]` is either 'E' or 'W'. If `s[i]` is 'E', `count_east` is decreased by 1 and `result` contains 'R'. If `s[i]` is 'W', `count_west` is decreased by 1 and `result` contains 'H'.***
