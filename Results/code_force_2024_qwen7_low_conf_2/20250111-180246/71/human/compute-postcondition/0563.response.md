The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was initially an empty list `[]`, after appending `'R'`, `pp` will become `['R']`.

The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `1`, `h` is `0`, the current value of `i` is 'S', `rr` is `[0, 1, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `pp` is `['R']`, the condition `(i == 'S')` is true, and the current value of `ss` is `0`.**
