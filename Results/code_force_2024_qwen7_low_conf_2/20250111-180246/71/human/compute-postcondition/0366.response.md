The code snippet `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Based on the initial state, `pp` could be one of the following lists depending on the values of `r` and `h`:

- `['R']` if `r` is 2 and `h` is 1
- `['H']` if `r` is 2 and `h` is 2
- `['R', 'H']` if `r` is 3 and `h` is 1 or 2

Since the code appends `'R'` to `pp`, the new list `pp` will be:

- `['R', 'R']` if `r` is 2 and `h` is 1
- `['H', 'R']` if `r` is 2 and `h` is 2
- `['R', 'H', 'R']` if `r` is 3 and `h` is 1 or 2

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2 or 3, `h` is 1 or 2, `rr` is one of [0, True, 1, False], [1, True, 1, False], or [-1, True, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is one of ['R', 'R'], ['H', 'R'], or ['R', 'H', 'R'], `i` is 'E'.**
