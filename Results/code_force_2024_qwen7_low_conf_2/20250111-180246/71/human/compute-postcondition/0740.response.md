Postcondition: ***`r` is incremented by 1 if `ss % 2 == 1`. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1. `pp` is either `[R]` or contains 'H'. The loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed.***
