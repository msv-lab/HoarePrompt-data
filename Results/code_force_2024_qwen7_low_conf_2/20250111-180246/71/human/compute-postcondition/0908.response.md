`pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'E' and its current value is 'N', and `hh[1]` is 0, and `h` is increased by 1, these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `pp` now includes the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'E' and the current value of `i` is 'N', `hh[1]` is 0; `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing at least one element and now includes 'H'**
