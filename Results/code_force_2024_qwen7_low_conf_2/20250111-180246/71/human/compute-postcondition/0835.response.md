`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a new list being created here. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `pp`, so after appending `'R'`, `pp` becomes `['R']`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'W', `ww` is False, `r` is 1, `pp` is `['R']`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'W', `ww` is False, `r` is 1, `pp` is `['R']`**
