Postcondition: ***`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 1 or 2, `rr` is one of [0, False, 1, False], [1, False, 1, False], or [-1, False, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `i` is 'E', `pp` is `['R', 'H']` if `pp` was `['R']` or `['R', 'H']` when `r < h` is true, `pp` is `['H', 'H']` if `pp` was `['H']` when `r < h` is true, otherwise `pp` remains as `['R']` or `['H']` based on the values of `r` and `h`.***
