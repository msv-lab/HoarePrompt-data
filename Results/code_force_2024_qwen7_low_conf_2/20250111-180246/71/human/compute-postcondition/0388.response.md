The code initializes `n`, `s`, `w`, and `e` to 0. This means that regardless of the initial values of `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, and `l`, these variables will now be set to 0. The initial counts (`nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`) will be recalculated based on the new values of `n`, `s`, `w`, and `e`.

Output State: **`n` is 0, `s` is 0, `w` is 0, `e` is 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ww` is 0, `ee` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is the new input string**
