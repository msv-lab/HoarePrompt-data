`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. This means that `pp` now contains the last element plus the new value `'R'`. The loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `rr[2]` is one more than its previous value, `r` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **The loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `rr[2]` is one more than its previous value, `r` is increased by 1; `pp` contains the last element plus the new value `'R'`.**
