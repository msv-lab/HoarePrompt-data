`ss` is decremented by 1. Depending on the original value of `ss`, `r` or `h` will be updated accordingly, and `pp` will be modified based on the new value of `ss`.

- If `ss` was odd, then `r` was increased by 1 and `pp` was `['R']`. Now, since `ss` is decremented by 1, it becomes even.
- If `ss` was even, then `h` was its original value plus 1 and `pp` was `['H']`. Now, since `ss` is decremented by 1, it becomes odd.

Therefore, the new states are:
- `r` remains unchanged because `ss` is now even.
- `h` remains unchanged because `ss` is now even.
- `pp` changes from `['R']` to `['H']`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N', 'W', or 'E', `ss` is one less than its original value, `r` is the same as before, `h` is the same as before, and `pp` is `['H']`.**
