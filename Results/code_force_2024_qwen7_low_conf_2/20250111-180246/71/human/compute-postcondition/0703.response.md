`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The initial states of the variables `hh[2]` being decreased by 1, `h` being increased by 1, and the loop executing one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the updated states remain the same as the initial states.

Output State: **`hh[2]` is decreased by 1; `h` is increased by 1; the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`.**
