Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Understanding**:
   - `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` are integers.
   - `m` is an input integer (not relevant for this specific task).
   - `l` is a non-empty input string.
   - The variable `i` takes characters from the string `l` in each iteration.

2. **Key Points from the Problem**:
   - If `i` is 'N', then `n` is 1, and all other variables remain 0.
   - If `i` is 'S', then `s` is 2, and all other variables remain 0.
   - If `i` is 'W', then `w` is 1, and all other variables remain 0.
   - If `i` is 'E', then `e` is 1, and all other variables remain 0.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop runs over each character in the string `l`.
   - For the loop to continue, there must be at least one more character in `l`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since the loop iterates over each character in `l`, the next character in `l` should be considered for `i`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is simply that there must be more characters left in the string `l`.

5. **Final State Calculation**:
   - The current state is the last processed character `i` from the string `l`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `l` should be assigned to `i`.
   - All other variables (`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`) will be reset according to the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration would be:

- The string `l` is still non-empty, but now it has one less character.
- The variable `i` is the next character in `l`.
- Depending on the value of `i`, the corresponding variable (`n`, `s`, `w`, or `e`) is set to 1, and all others remain 0.

State: **`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`, and either `n`, `s`, `w`, or `e` is 1 (depending on `i`), while all other variables (`nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`) remain 0**.

If we denote the next character in `l` as `i_next`, the exact state would be:

- `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` are integers.
- `m` is an input integer (not relevant for this specific task).
- `l` is a non-empty input string with one less character.
- `i` is the next character in `l` (`i_next`).
- Depending on `i_next`, the corresponding variable (`n`, `s`, `w`, or `e`) is 1, and all others remain 0.

State: **`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`, and either `n`, `s`, `w`, or `e` is 1 (depending on `i`), while all other variables (`nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`) remain 0**.
