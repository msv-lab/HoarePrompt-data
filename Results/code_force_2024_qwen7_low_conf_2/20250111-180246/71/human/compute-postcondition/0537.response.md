Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` and `h` represent different states based on the condition `(nn % 2 == 1)`, `nn` is updated to one less than its initial value and thus changes its parity, `rr` and `hh` are lists `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or updated based on the parity of `nn`, `pp` is either `['R']` or `['H']` based on the new parity of `nn`, and the current character being processed is 'N'. If `nn` is odd, then `r` and `h` remain unchanged, `nn` is decremented by 1, `rr` remains `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `hh` remains `[0, 0, 0, 0]`. Otherwise, `r` and `h` are both incremented by 1, `nn` is decremented by 1, `rr` is updated to `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, and `hh` is updated to `[1, 0, 0, 0]`.***
