`r` is incremented by 1, and the other variables remain unchanged based on the given conditions. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`, `r` is increased by 1, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.**
