In the given code snippet, the variable `hh[3]` is decremented by 1. This means that the fourth element (index 3) of the list `hh` is reduced by 1.

Let's assume the initial value of `hh[3]` was `x`. After executing the code snippet, the value of `hh[3]` will be `x - 1`.

Since no other variables are affected, the output state is:

Output State: **`hh[3]` is `hh[3] - 1`**
