`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The value of `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', `r` is less than `h`, and `rr` is a list where the fourth element is incremented by 1. The append operation does not affect `l`, `i`, `r`, or `rr`, but it adds `'R'` to `pp`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', `r` is less than `h`, `rr` is a list where the fourth element is incremented by 1, `pp` is a list with its last element being 'R'**
