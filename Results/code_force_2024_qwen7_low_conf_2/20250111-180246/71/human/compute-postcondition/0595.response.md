Postcondition: ***`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` retain their original values except when the following conditions are met:
- If `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains 'R'.
- If `r >= h`, then `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.***

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering the impact of both the if and else parts on the relevant variables.
