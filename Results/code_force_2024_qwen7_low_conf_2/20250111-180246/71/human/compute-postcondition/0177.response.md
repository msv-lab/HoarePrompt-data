`rr[1]` is incremented by 1. The value of `rr[1]` was initially false, so after adding 1, it becomes `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W', and `i` is not equal to 'E', and the condition `(ss)` is false, and `(rr[0])` is false, and `(hh[0])` is false, and `r` is less than `h`, and `rr[1]` is True**
