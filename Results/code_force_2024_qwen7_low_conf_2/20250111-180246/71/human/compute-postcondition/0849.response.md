`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The initial state of `pp` is not specified, so we assume it is an empty list initially. After appending `'H'`, `pp` becomes a list containing `'H'`. The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `ww` is False, `rr[3]` remains False, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, and `hh[2]` is incremented by 1; `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is ['H']**
