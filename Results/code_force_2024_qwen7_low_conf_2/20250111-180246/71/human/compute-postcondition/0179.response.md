The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since no initial value for `pp` was provided, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W', and `i` is not equal to 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, `(rr[0])` is false, `(hh[0])` is false, `r` is less than `h` + 1, and `rr[1]` is True; `pp` is now equal to `['R']`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W', and `i` is not equal to 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, `(rr[0])` is false, `(hh[0])` is false, `r` is less than `h` + 1, and `rr[1]` is True; `pp` is ['R']**
