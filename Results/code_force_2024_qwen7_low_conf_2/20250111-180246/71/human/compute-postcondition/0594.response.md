The code snippet `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The values of `hh[2]` and `h` are incremented by 1 in the initial state. The state of these variables is not affected by the current code snippet.

Output State: **`hh[2]` is incremented by 1; `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing one element 'H'**
