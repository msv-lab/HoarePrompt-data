The code `rr[2] += 1` increments the value at index 2 of the list `rr` by 1. Given the initial state of `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`, the value at index 2 is currently 1. Incrementing this value by 1 results in 2. 

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 2, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
