`pp` is a list that appends the value 'H'. Since no initial values for `pp` were given, we assume `pp` was empty before the code execution. After appending 'H', `pp` will contain the element 'H'. The values of `n`, `m`, `ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6; `h` is incremented by 1; `pp` is ['H'].

Output State: **`n` is either 3 or 5; `m` is either 4 or 6; `h` is incremented by 1; `pp` is ['H']**
