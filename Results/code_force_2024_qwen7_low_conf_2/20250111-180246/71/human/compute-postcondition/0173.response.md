`h` is incremented by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W', and `i` is not equal to 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, `(rr[0])` is false, `(hh[0])` is false, and `h` is increased by 1.
