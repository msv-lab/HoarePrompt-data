Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`. If `ww % 2 == 1`, then `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`, `pp` is a list containing one additional element `'R'`, and `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`. Otherwise, `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`, `pp` is a list containing one more element `'H'`, and `h` is now `ww % 2 + 1`.***
