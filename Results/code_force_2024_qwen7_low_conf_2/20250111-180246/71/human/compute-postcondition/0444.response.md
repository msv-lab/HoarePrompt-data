The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The list `pp` was initially an empty list `[]`. After appending `'H'`, the list `pp` becomes `['H']`.

No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is either `w - e` or `0` depending on the condition `w > e`, `ee` is either `0` or `e - w` depending on the condition `w > e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `0`, `h` is `1`, `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and ww % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0`, `rr` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `pp` is `['H']`, the current value of `i` is 'W', `ww` is not `0`, `ww % 2 == 0`.**
