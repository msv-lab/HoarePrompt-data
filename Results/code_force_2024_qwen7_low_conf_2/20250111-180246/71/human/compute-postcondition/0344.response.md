The code snippet appends 'R' to the list `pp`. Based on the initial state, `pp` can be either `['R']`, `['H']`, or `['R', 'H']`. Regardless of its initial value, appending 'R' will result in `pp` becoming `['R', 'R']`, `['H', 'R']`, or `['R', 'H', 'R']`.

The value of `r` is increased by 1, so `r` is now 3 (from 2) or 4 (from 3).

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 3 or 4, `h` is 1 or 2, `rr` is one of `[1, False, 1, False]`, `[2, False, 1, False]`, or `[0, False, 1, False]`, `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is one of `['R', 'R']`, `['H', 'R']`, or `['R', 'H', 'R']`, and `i` is 'E'.**
