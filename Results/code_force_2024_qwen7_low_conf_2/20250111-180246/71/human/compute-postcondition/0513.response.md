Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` and `h` represent different states based on the condition `(nn % 2 == 1)`, `nn` is either odd or even, `rr` and `hh` are lists `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `pp` is either `['R']` or `['H']`, and the current character being processed is 'N'. If `nn` is odd, `r` is `1`, `h` is `0`, and `pp` is `['R']`. Otherwise, `r` is `0`, `h` is `1`, and `pp` is `['H']`.***
