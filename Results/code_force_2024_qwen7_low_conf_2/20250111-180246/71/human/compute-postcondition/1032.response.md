`ss` is decremented by 1. The value of `l`, `i`, `ww % 2 == 1`, `pp`, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list containing either one additional element `'R'` or the initial state plus `'H'`, `h` is `h + 1` if the else part executed, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, `ss` is decreased by 1.**
