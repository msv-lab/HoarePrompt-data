Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `1` if `r < h` or `0` otherwise, `h` is `1` if `r < h` and `h` was initially `0`, `h` is `2` if `r >= h` and `h` was initially `0`, `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and r % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0` if `rr[2]` is `0`, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]` if `r < h` or a list of zeros otherwise, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]` if `r < h` and `h` was initially `0`, or `[0, 0, 0, 2]` if `r >= h` and `h` was initially `0`, `pp` is `['R']` if `r < h` or `['H']` if `r >= h`, the current character being processed is not 'E'.***
