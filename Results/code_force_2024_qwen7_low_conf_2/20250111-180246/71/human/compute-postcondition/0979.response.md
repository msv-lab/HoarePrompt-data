Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list. If `r < h`, then `pp` remains unchanged and includes `'R'`. Otherwise, `pp` is updated by appending `'H'` and the third element of `hh` is incremented by 1. Both `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers, with `hh` being even.***
