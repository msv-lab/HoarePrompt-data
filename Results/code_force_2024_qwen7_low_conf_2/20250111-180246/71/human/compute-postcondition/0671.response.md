`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `r` is increased by 1. Therefore, the value of `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` contains the value `'R'`**
