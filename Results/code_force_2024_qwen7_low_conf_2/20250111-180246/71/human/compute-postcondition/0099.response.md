The code `rr[2] -= 1` decrements the value at index 2 of the list `rr` by 1. Given the initial state where `rr[2]` is `true`, this operation changes its value to `false` because in Python, the boolean value `true` is represented as `True`, which is equivalent to the integer `1`. Subtracting `1` from `True` results in `False`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, and the current value of `i` is 'E', `rr[2]` is false**
