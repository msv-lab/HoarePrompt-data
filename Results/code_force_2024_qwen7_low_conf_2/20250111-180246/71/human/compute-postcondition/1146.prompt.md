You have been assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for analyzing the program's state after the for loop. The initial state of the code has already been provided. Additionally, you can see how the state changes after the loop executes a few times. The initial state includes the values and relationships of the variables before the program execution. The output state should include the values and relationships of the variables after all the iterations of the for loop have executed. Similar to the initial state, avoid explaining how the program operates; focus solely on the variable values and their interrelations. 
In the information given, the output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 
You must adhere to the text format: Output State: **output state.**
I am giving you two examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Example 1: 

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer, `factorial` is 1.
Code of the loop:
```
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    factorial *= i
```
Output state after the loop executes 1 times:  `factorial` is `1`, 'i' is 1 , n must be at least 1.
Output state after the loop executes 2 times: `factorial` is 2, 'i' is 2 , n must be at least 2.
Output state after the loop executes 3 times: `factorial` is 6 , 'i' is 3 , n must be at least 3.

Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 1:
If n is greater than 0 the loop will execute at least once and factorial will contain the factorial of n and i will be n. If n is 0  then the loop wont execute and factorial will remain 1 which is indeed the factorial for 0.
Therefore, the output state of the loop is that `factorial` is the factorial of `n`
Output State: **``n` is a non negative  integer, `factorial` is the factorial of 'n'**

Example 2: 

Initial State:  `total` is 0,'students_num' is 0, students is a list of students.
Code of the loop:
```
for student in students:
    total += student
    students_num += 1
```
Output State after the loop executes 1 times:  `total` is equal to the first student, 'students_num' is 1, students is a list that must have at least one student, student is the first student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student, 'students_num' is 2, students is a list that must have at least 2 students, student is the second student in the list.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `total` is equal to the first student plus the second student plus the third student, 'students_num' is 3, students is a list that must have at least 3 students, student is the third student in the list.


Now, please think step by step. Using the results from the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example as hints but  mostly from the loop code, determine the loop's output state.

Example Answer 2:
The loop calculates the sum of a list students and stores it in total and the number of students in students_num. The loop will be executed at least once if students is a list with at least one student. If the list is empty the loop does not execute and total and students_num are 0.
Output State: **total is equal to the sum of all students, students_num is the number of students, students is a list of students.**

Your Task:

Initial State: `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in `l`, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ww` is 0, `ee` is 0, `r` is 0, `h` is 0, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is an empty list `[]`.
Code of the loop:
```

The output state after the loop executes some number of times include what needed to be true for the loop to execute at least that number of times. 
Output State after the loop executes 1 times: *`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is a string. If `i` equals 'W', `l` remains unchanged, and `r`, `pp`, and `h` are updated according to the initial state of `ww % 2 == 1` and `rr[3]`:
- If `ww` is initially true, `r` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial state of `ww % 2 == 1`, `pp` is `['H']` if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was true and `['R']` if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was false, and `h` is 1 if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was true and unchanged if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was false.
- If `ww` is initially false, `r` is 0, `pp` is `['R']` if `rr[3]` is true and `['H']` if `rr[3]` is false. If `rr[3]` is false, then `hh[3]` is 1.
- Depending on the value of `r` compared to `h`, `rr[2]` or `hh[2]` is incremented, and `pp` is updated accordingly.
If `i` is 'E' and `ee` is true, `h` is increased by 1 if the new parity of `ee` is odd, `r` is increased by 1 if the new parity of `ee` is even, `ee` is decreased by 1, `pp` is either 'R' or ['H'] based on the new parity of `ee`, and the condition `(ee)` retains its truth value.
If `i` is 'E' and `ee` is false, `r` is increased by 1 if `rr[2]` is False, `pp` is ['R'] in this case. If `hh[2]` is True, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`.
If `i` is 'N' and `nn` was initially true and odd, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'R', `h` remains unchanged, and `nn` is one less than its initial value.
If `i` is 'N' and `nn` was initially false, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing 'H', and `nn` is one less than its initial value.
If `i` is 'N' and `rr[1]` is 0, then `r` is `r_val + 1`, `pp` is a list containing 'R', and `h` remains unchanged.
If `i` is 'N' and `hh[1]` is 0, then `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains 'H'.
If `r < h` holds true and the first element of `rr` is not True, `pp` includes the additional element 'R'.
Otherwise, the first element of `l` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the value 'H'.
If `i` is any string other than 'N', `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing either:
- All its original elements plus the new element 'R' (if `ss` is even).
- The element 'R' (if the first element of `rr` is True).
- The element 'H' (if the first element of `hh` is 1).
Additionally, if `r < h` and the first element of `rr` is not True, `pp` includes the additional element 'R'. If `r >= h` and the first element of `hh` is not 1, `h` is incremented by 1.
Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`, and `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are boolean variables and lists respectively. If `i == 'W'`:
- If `ww` is initially odd, `r` is `r-1`, `pp` contains the elements of the original `pp` plus `'H'`. If `ww` is initially even, `r` is `r+1`, `pp` contains the elements of the original `pp` plus `'R'`. If `ww` is initially odd and `rr[3]` is true, then `pp` is `[i, 'R']` and `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`. If `ww` is initially even and `rr[3]` is false, then `pp` remains unchanged and includes `'R'` if `r < h` and `hh[3]` is false, or updates to include `'H'` and `h` is incremented by 1 if `hh[3]` is true. `ee` and `nn` remain unchanged, `rr` is a list with its fourth element decreased by 1, and `hh` is a list with its third element possibly incremented by 1.
- If `i == 'E'`:
  - If `ee` is true, `pp` contains an additional element `'R'` if `ee % 2 == 1` or `'H'` otherwise, and `r` and `h` are updated based on the new value of `ee % 2`. If `ee` is false, if `rr[2]` is true, `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains an additional element `'R'`, and `hh`, `ee`, and `nn` remain unchanged. If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1. If `r < h`, then `r` is set to the initial value of `ww % 2 == 1` plus 1 and `pp` contains the string `'R'`. If `r >= h`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains the string `'H'`.
- If `i == 'N'`:
  - If `nn % 2 == 1` was True, then `pp` is `['R']`; otherwise, `pp` is `['H']`.
  - If `rr[1]` is true, then `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[1]` is decreased by 1, and the last element of `pp` is `'H'`.
  - If `r < h`, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1. If `r >= h`, the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and `pp` includes the string `'H'`.
- If `i == 'S'`:
  - If `ss` is true, `pp` may contain an additional element `'R'` or `'H'`, and `h` is incremented by 1 if the else part executed.
  - If `rr[0]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `hh` is a list where its first element is decremented by 1 and `hh[0]` is true, and `hh` and `rr` remain lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.
  - If `rr[0]` is false, `pp` may contain an additional element `'H'` if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise `pp` remains unchanged. `hh` is a list where its first element is decreased by 1 if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise the first element of `hh` is increased by 1. If `hh[0]` is true, `h` is incremented by 1 based on `ww % 2 == 1`. If `hh[0]` is false, if `r < h`, then `pp` has an additional element `'R'` and `rr[1]` is increased by 1, otherwise `hh[1]` is increased by 1 and `h` is set to `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`.
Output State after the loop executes 3 times: *`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before; `i` is the next element in the list; `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`. If `i == 'W'`, then:
- `ww` is decremented by 1 if `ww` is greater than 0, `r` is set to 1, `pp` is a list containing one additional element `'H'`, and `h` is set to 1; otherwise, `r` is updated based on the following conditions: `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`; `pp` is updated based on the conditions: if `rr[3]` is True, `pp` is appended with `'R'`; if `hh[3]` is True and `r < h`, `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['R']; if `hh[3]` is False and `r < h`, `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['H']; otherwise, `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['H']. `h` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `rr[2]` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1. `r` is increased by 1 regardless of the condition, and `hh[3]` is decreased by 1; `hh` remains unchanged; `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` remain adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.
- If `i == 'E'`, then `pp` contains at least the original elements plus either `'R'` or `'H'`, and `h` is increased by 1.
- If `i == 'N'`, then:
  - If `nn - 1 % 2 == 1`, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus the string `'R'`, and `r` is increased by 1.
  - If `nn - 1 % 2 != 1`, `h` is equal to its previous value plus 1, and `pp` contains an additional element `'H'`.
  - If `nn` becomes 0, depending on `rr[1]`, `pp` may be reduced to `['R']`, `r` may be increased by 1, `h` may be increased by 1, and `hh[1]` may be reduced by 1.
  - Depending on `hh[1]`, `pp` may contain all its previous elements plus `'H'` and `h` may be increased by 1, or `pp` may contain its original elements plus either `'R'` or `'H'`.
  - If `r < h`, `hh[0]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `hh[0]` is increased by 2, `h` is increased by 1, and `r` remains unchanged.
  - `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.
- If `i == 'S'`, then:
  - If `(ss - 1) % 2 == 1`, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list with one additional element `'R'`.
  - If `(ss - 1) % 2 != 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `pp` now includes `'H'`, and `h` is increased by 1.
  - If `rr[0]` is true, `rr[0]` is reduced by 1, `pp` is `['R']`, and `r` is equal to `rr[0] - 1`.
  - If `hh[0]` is true, `hh[0]` is reduced by 1, `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`, and `h` is increased by 1.
  - If `r < h`, `r` is incremented by 1, `pp` contains one additional element `'R'`, and `rr[1]` is incremented by 1.
  - If `r >= h`, `pp` is the original list plus `'H'`, `hh[1]` is increased by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1.
- If `i != 'S'`, no changes occur.


Now, please think step by step. Use the results from the output states for the first few iterations of the loop provided in the example to help you , but mostly focus on the loop code to determine the loop's output state after ALL THE ITERATIONS OF THE LOOP HAVE FINISHED. Try to understand what  will be the values of the variables after it executes. In the case the loop doesnot execute, what will be the values of the variables.
If the state of some variables is dependant on earlier or the oginal value of some variable, make sure to seprate the original value from the current value.
Use the fomrat Output State: **the output state you calculate**
