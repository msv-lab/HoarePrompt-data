Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E'. If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `h`, then `rr` is a list where the fourth element is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list with its last element being 'R'. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains 'H'.***
