The code `count_west += 1` increments the value of `count_west` by 1. Given that `count_west` was initially 0, it now becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', `count_north` is 0, `count_south` is 0, `count_west` is 1, `count_east` is 0, the character `char` is not 'S', and `char` is not 'E'**
