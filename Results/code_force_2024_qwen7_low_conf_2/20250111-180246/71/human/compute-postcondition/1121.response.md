`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. This operation does not affect the length of the list `l`, the value of `i`, or the boolean values of `ww % 2 == 1`, `r`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh`. The only change is that `pp` now contains one more element, `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh`, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list with one additional element `'R'`**
