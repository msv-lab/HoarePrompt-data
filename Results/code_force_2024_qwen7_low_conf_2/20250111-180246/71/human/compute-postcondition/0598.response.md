Postcondition: ***`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` remain unchanged unless the following conditions are met:
- If `ww` is true and `ww % 2 == 1`, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
- If `ww` is true and `ww % 2 == 0`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['H']`.
- If `ww` is false, then:
  - `rr[3]` is decremented by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R' if `rr[3]` was initially true.
  - If `rr[3]` is false, then `hh[3]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list with an additional element `'H'` if `hh[3]` is true.
  - If `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains 'R'.
  - If `r >= h`, then `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, and `h` is increased by 1.***

This ensures that the overall state of the program variables is correctly described after the if-else block executes, adhering to the specified conditions.
