`pp` is a list to which the string `'R'` is appended. The initial state of `l`, `i`, `rr[1]`, and `r` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is 0, `r` is `r_val + 1`, and `pp` is a list with an additional element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is 0, `r` is `r_val + 1`, `pp` is a list containing elements equal to ['R']**
