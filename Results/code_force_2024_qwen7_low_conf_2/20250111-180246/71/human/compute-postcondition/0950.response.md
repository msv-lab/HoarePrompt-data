`h` is incremented by 1. The value of `h` was initially greater than or equal to `r`, so it remains greater than or equal to `r`. The second element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and the values of `l`, `i`, `rr`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is some other string, `rr` is [False], `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, and the second element of `hh` is incremented by 1.**
