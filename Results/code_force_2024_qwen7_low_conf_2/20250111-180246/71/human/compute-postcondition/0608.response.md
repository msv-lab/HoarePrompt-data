The code snippet `hh[2] -= 1` decrements the value at index 2 of the list `hh` by 1. Since no specific values for `hh` were provided initially, we'll denote the value at index 2 as `hh[2]`. After executing the code, the value at index 2 of `hh` will be reduced by 1.

Output State: **`hh[2]` is `hh[2] - 1`**
