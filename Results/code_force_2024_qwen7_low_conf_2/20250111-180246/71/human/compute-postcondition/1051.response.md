Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are boolean variables and lists respectively. If `i == 'E'`:
- If `ee` is true, `pp` contains an additional element `'R'` if `ee % 2 == 1` or `'H'` otherwise, and `r` and `h` are updated based on the new value of `ee % 2`. If `ee` is false, if `rr[2]` is true, `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains an additional element `'R'`, and `hh`, `ee`, and `nn` remain unchanged. If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1. If `r < h`, then `r` is set to the initial value of `ww % 2 == 1` plus 1 and `pp` contains the string `'R'`. If `r >= h`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains the string `'H'`.
- If `i == 'N'`:
  - If `nn % 2 == 1` was True, then `pp` is `['R']`; otherwise, `pp` is `['H']`.
  - If `rr[1]` is true, then `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[1]` is decreased by 1, and the last element of `pp` is `'H'`.
  - If `r < h`, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1. If `r >= h`, the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and `pp` includes the string `'H'`.
- If `i == 'S'`:
  - If `ss` is true, `pp` may contain an additional element `'R'` or `'H'`, and `h` is incremented by 1 if the else part executed.
  - If `rr[0]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `hh` is a list where its first element is decremented by 1 and `hh[0]` is true, and `hh` and `rr` remain lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.
  - If `rr[0]` is false, `pp` may contain an additional element `'H'` if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise `pp` remains unchanged. `hh` is a list where its first element is decreased by 1 if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise the first element of `hh` is increased by 1. If `hh[0]` is true, `h` is incremented by 1 based on `ww % 2 == 1`. If `hh[0]` is false, if `r < h`, then `pp` has an additional element `'R'` and `rr[1]` is increased by 1, otherwise `hh[1]` is increased by 1 and `h` is set to `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`.***

This postcondition summarizes the possible states of the program after executing the if-else block, considering all the conditions specified in the if and else parts.
