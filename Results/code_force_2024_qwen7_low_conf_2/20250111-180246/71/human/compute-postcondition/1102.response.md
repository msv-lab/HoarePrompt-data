Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`. If `nn % 2 == 1`, then `pp` contains all its previous elements plus the string `'R'`, and `r` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `h` is equal to its previous value plus 1, and `pp` contains an additional element `'H'`.***
