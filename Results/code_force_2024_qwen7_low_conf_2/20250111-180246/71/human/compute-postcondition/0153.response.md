Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E'. If `nn` is even, then `h` is 1 and `pp` is ['H']. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is ['H'], or if `r` is less than `h`, then `r` is increased by 1, `rr[0]` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['R']. If `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, then `hh[0]` is increased by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, covering both the if and else parts and their respective outcomes.
