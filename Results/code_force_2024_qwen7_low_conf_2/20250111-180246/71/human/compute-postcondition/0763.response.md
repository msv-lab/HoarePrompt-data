Postcondition: **`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` are such that:
- `n`, `s`, `w`, `e` are the counts of 'N', 'S', 'W', and 'E' in the string `l`.
- `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` are the final values derived from the operations during the loop.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `l` is the input string.
- `r`, `h` are the final counts of 'R' and 'H' derived from the loop.
- `rr` and `hh` are updated lists based on the conditions during the loop.
- `pp` is the final list containing the sequence of 'R' and 'H'.
- The condition `(r and h)` is true.**
