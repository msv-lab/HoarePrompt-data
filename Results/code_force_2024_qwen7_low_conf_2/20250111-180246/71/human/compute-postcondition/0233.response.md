Postcondition: ***`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is either 1 or 2, `h` is either 1 or 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, 1] or [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, 0] or [False, False, 0, 1], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, and `pp` is either ['R'] or ['H'].***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes based on the if and else parts of the if statement. It specifies the state of all relevant variables after the execution of the if-else block, considering both branches of the conditional statement.
