In the given code snippet, the line `hh[1] += 1` increments the second element (index 1) of the list `hh` by 1. 

Let's assume the initial state of the variable `hh` is `[h1, h2, ..., hn]`. After executing `hh[1] += 1`, the second element of `hh` (which was originally `h2`) is now `h2 + 1`.

Output State: **`hh` is `[h1, h2 + 1, ..., hn]`**
