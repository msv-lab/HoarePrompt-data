`h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` is not specified, so we only know that it was previously a value that allowed the condition `(ss) is true and ss % 2 == 0` to be met. The other variables (`l`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W', and `i` is not equal to 'E', and the condition `(ss)` is true, and `ss % 2 == 0`, `h` is incremented by 1**
