`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. The value of `h` is incremented by 1, which means `h` is now `h + 1`. The condition for the loop to continue executing one more time remains the same, meaning there must be at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` must allow the loop to proceed.

Output State: **`l` has at least one more character and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `h` is incremented by 1, so `h` is now `h + 1`; `pp` contains the element `'H'`**
