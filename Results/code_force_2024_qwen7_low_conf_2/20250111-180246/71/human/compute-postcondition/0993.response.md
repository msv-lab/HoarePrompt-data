`h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `h` is determined by the condition `ww % 2 == 1`. Since this condition does not change after the increment, the output state will reflect that `h` has increased by 1 while all other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, and `h` is increased by 1.**
