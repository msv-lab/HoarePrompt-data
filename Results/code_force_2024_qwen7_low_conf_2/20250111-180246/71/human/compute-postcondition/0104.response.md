The code decrements the value of `hh[2]` by 1. Since the precondition states that `(hh[2])` is true (meaning `hh[2]` is a non-zero value), after decrementing by 1, `hh[2]` will still be a non-zero value. The states of the other variables (`l` and `i`) are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh[2]` is a non-zero value decreased by 1**
