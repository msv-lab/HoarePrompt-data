The code `print('NO')` does not affect any of the variables. It only prints the string 'NO' to the console. The values of the variables `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, and `l` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is either `w - e` or `0` depending on the condition `w > e`, `ee` is either `0` or `e - w` depending on the condition `w > e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, and 'NO' is printed to the console. At least one of `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, or `ee` is odd.**
