Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list, and `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`. If `i == 'S'`, then:
- If `(ss - 1) % 2 == 1`, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list with one additional element `'R'`.
- If `(ss - 1) % 2 != 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `pp` now includes `'H'`, and `h` is increased by 1.
- If `rr[0]` is true, `rr[0]` is reduced by 1, `pp` is `['R']`, and `r` is equal to `rr[0] - 1`.
- If `hh[0]` is true, `hh[0]` is reduced by 1, `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`, and `h` is increased by 1.
- If `r < h`, `r` is incremented by 1, `pp` contains one additional element `'R'`, and `rr[1]` is incremented by 1.
- If `r >= h`, `pp` is the original list plus `'H'`, `hh[1]` is increased by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1.
If `i != 'S'`, no changes occur.***
