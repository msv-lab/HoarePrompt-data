According to the code, the loop `for i in l:` will iterate over each element in the list `l`. For the loop to execute, the list `l` must contain at least one element.

Here are the steps to determine the necessary adjustments:

1. **Initial States**: The initial states are given as follows:
   - `_` is 1
   - `t` must be greater than 1
   - `m` is an integer input value
   - `l` is the input from the user
   - `n` is 0
   - `s` is 0
   - `w` is 0
   - `e` is 0

2. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if the list `l` contains at least one element. 

3. **Adjusting States**: Since the loop depends on the list `l`, we need to ensure that `l` has at least one element for the loop to execute. We do not need to adjust the values of `_`, `t`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `w`, or `e` because these variables are not directly related to the condition for the loop's execution.

Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to ensure that `l` is a non-empty list.

State: **`_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` must be a non-empty list, `n` is 0, `s` is 0, `w` is 0, `e` is 0**
