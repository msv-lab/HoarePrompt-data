The code `hh[3] += 1` attempts to increment the value at index 3 of the list `hh` by 1. However, there is no definition of the list `hh` in the provided initial state, and the value of `i` is specified to be 'E'. Since `hh` is not defined, this operation would raise an error in a real execution environment. For the sake of this exercise, we will assume that `hh` is a list and that the operation is performed as intended.

Given that the initial state does not specify the contents of `hh`, and since the operation only modifies `hh`, we can say that `hh` is now modified such that the element at index 3 is incremented by 1. The other variables (`l` and `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh` is a list where the element at index 3 is incremented by 1**
