The code `pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since no other variables are directly affected by this line of code, the only change is to the list `pp`.

- The initial state of `pp` is unknown, but after appending `'R'`, it now contains the element `'R'`.
- The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list containing the element `'R'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` is a list where the value at index 1 is `-1`, `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers respectively, and `r` is `r + 1`.**
