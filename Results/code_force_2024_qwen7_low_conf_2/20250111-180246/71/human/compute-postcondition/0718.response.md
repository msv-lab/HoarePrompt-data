Postcondition: **`l` is a list, `i` is the index of the current character in `l`, `nn` is an integer, `r` and `pp` are variables, and `h` is an integer. If `nn % 2 == 1`, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains 'R'. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['H']`. The loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed.**
