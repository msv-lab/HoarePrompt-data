The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains as follows:

- `l` is a non-empty list
- `i` is the next element in the list
- `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`
- `ee` is a boolean variable
- `nn` is a boolean variable
- `rr[2]` is `x + 1` where `x` was the initial value of `rr[2]`
- `r` is the previous value of `r` + 1
- `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers
- `pp` is now a list that includes the additional element `'R'`

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list including `'R'`, and `h` is a list containing boolean values and integers.**
