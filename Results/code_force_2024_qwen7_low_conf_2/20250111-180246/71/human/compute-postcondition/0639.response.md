Postcondition: ***`rr[0]` is `initial_value + 1` or `hh[0]` is `val + 1`; `r` is `initial_value + 2` or `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'`***

Explanation:
- The if condition checks whether `r < h`. If this condition is true, then `rr[0]` becomes `initial_value + 1`, `r` becomes `initial_value + 2`, and `pp` is a list containing `'R'`.
- If the if condition is false, then `hh[0]` becomes `val + 1`, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing `'H'`.

In either case, the postcondition summarizes the resulting states of `rr[0]`, `r`, `hh[0]`, `h`, and `pp` based on the outcome of the if condition.
