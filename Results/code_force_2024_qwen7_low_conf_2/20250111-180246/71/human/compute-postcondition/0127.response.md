`h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` is not specified, but it is implied to be 0 since it is not mentioned otherwise. The states of the other variables (`l`, `i`, and the condition `nn`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, and `h` is 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, and `h` is 1**
