The variable `h` is incremented by 1, but since no initial value for `h` is provided, we can denote its new value as `h+1`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, and the condition `(ww % 2 == 1)`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `(ww % 2 == 1)` is false, `h` is incremented by 1**
