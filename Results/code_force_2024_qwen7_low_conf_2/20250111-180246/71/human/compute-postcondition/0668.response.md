Postcondition: **The overall state of the program after the if-else block executes depends on the current character `i`:

- If `i == 'W'`:
  - `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` remain unchanged unless the following conditions are met:
    - If `ww` is true and `ww % 2 == 1`, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
    - If `ww` is true and `ww % 2 == 0`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['H']`.
    - If `ww` is false, then:
      - `rr[3]` is decremented by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R' if `rr[3]` was initially true.
      - If `rr[3]` is false, then `hh[3]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list with an additional element `'H'` if `hh[3]` is true.
      - If `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains 'R'.
      - If `r >= h`, then `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, and `h` is increased by 1.

- If `i == 'E'` and `ee` is even:
  - `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` remain as specified in the initial state, and:
    - If `rr[2] > 0`, then `rr[2]` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains a list containing at least one element, which is `'R'`.
    - If `hh[2]` is true, then `hh[2]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.
    - If neither condition holds, then `hh[2]` is false, `r < h`, and `rr` is updated to `[a, b, c, d + 2]`, and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
    - If all previous conditions fail, then `hh[3]` is incremented by 1, and all other variables (`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`) are incremented by 1, and the initial values of `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are restored.

- If `i == 'E'` and `ee` is not even:
  - The overall state of the program remains consistent with the preconditions unless:
    - If the next character `i` is 'N' and `nn` is non-empty (`['H']`), then `r` and `pp` remain unchanged, and `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `hh`, `rr`, `hh` remain as specified in the initial state.
    - If the next character `i` is 'N' and `nn` is empty, then `rr[1]` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and if `hh[1]` is `True`, then `hh[1]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` becomes a list containing `'H'`.
    - If the next character `i` is 'N' and `hh[1]` is `False`, then either `rr[0]` is `initial_value + 1` or `hh[0]` is `val + 1`, `r` is `initial_value + 2` or `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` becomes a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'`.
    - If the next character `i` is 'S' and `ss` is `True`, then `ss` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1. The value of `pp` becomes `['h + 1', 'rr', 'hh', 'pp', 'H']`.
    - If the next character `i` is 'S' and `ss` is `False`, then the values of `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` remain the same as the preconditions.**
