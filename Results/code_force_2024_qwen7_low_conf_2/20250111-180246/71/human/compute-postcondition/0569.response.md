Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` and `h` are `0` or `1` based on the condition in the if-else block, `i` is 'S', `rr` and `hh` are lists based on the value of `r` and `h`, `pp` is a list `['R']` or `['H']` based on the value of `r` and `h`, and `ss` is `0`. If `hh[0]` is true, `h` is set to `1`, `rr` is set to `[ -1, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is set to `['H']`. Otherwise, `h` remains `0`, `rr` remains `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` remains `['R']`.***
