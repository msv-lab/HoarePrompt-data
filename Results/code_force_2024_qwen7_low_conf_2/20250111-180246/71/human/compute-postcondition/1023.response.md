Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `pp` is a list of strings, `hh` is a list of boolean values, and `rr` is a list of boolean values and integers. If `r < h`, then the first element of `rr` is increased by 1. Otherwise, the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and `pp` includes the string `'H'`.**
