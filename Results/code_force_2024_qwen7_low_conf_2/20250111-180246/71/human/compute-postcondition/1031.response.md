Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list containing either one additional element `'R'` or the initial state plus `'H'`, `h` is `h + 1` if the else part executed, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.**
