In the provided state, `rr` is a list `[0, False, 1, False]`. The code snippet `rr[3] -= 1` will subtract 1 from the fourth element of the list `rr`.

Let's update the value of `rr[3]`:

- Initially, `rr[3]` is `False`.
- Subtracting 1 from `False` results in `False - 1`, which in Python is considered as `not 1` and then `not (False - 1)`, leading to `False` since `False - 1` is still `False` and `not False` is `False`.

Therefore, the updated value of `rr[3]` remains `False`.

The rest of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, `rr[3]` is False**.
