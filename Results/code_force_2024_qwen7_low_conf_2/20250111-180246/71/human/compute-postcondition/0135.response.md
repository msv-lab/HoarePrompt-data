The code appends the string 'R' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is a list. The initial value of `pp` is not given, so we assume it is an empty list before the code is executed. After appending 'R' to it, the list `pp` becomes `['R']`.

Other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', and (not nn), `r` is 1, `pp` is ['R']**
