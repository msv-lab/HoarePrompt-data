Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is 1 if `i` is 'N', and `n` is 0 otherwise, `s` is either 2 if `i` is 'S' or 1 otherwise, `w` is 1 or 2 depending on whether `i` is 'W' or not, `e` is 2 if `i` is 'E', and `e` is 0 otherwise, and `i` is the next element in the list `l` after processing the if-else block.***
