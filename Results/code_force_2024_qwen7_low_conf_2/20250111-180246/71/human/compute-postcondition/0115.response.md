The code snippet appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. However, the initial state does not define the value of `pp`. Since `pp` is not defined in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before the code is executed.

After executing the line `pp.append('H')`, the list `pp` will contain the single element `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh` is a list where the element at index 3 is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
