`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `ss` is an odd number, and the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'S', the condition `(ss)` is true, and the current value of `ss` is an odd number; `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'S', the condition `(ss)` is true, and the current value of `ss` is an odd number; `r` is increased by 1**
