Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E'. If `rr[2]` is False, then `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['R']. Otherwise, if `hh[2]` is True, then `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`. If `r` is less than `h`, then `rr` is a list where the fourth element is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list with its last element being 'R'. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains 'H'.**
