In the given state, `hh` is `[False, False, 0, False]`. The code snippet is `hh[1] += 1`.

- `hh[1]` refers to the second element of the list `hh`, which is `False`.
- The operation `+= 1` is performed on `False`, but since `False` is a boolean value, adding 1 to it results in `True`.

Therefore, the second element of the list `hh` is updated to `True`.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
