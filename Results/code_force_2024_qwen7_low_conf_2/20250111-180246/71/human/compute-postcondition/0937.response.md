`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The value of `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'N' and is not 'S', and `r` is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'N' and is not 'S', `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the value `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'N' and is not 'S', `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R']**
