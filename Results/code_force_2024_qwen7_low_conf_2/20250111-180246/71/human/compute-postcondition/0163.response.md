Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', 'W', or 'E'. The condition `(ss)` is true. If `(ss % 2 == 1)`, then `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list with its last element being 'R'. If `(ss % 2 == 0)`, then `h` is its original value plus 1, and `pp` is `['H']`.***
