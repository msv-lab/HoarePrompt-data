`ww` is decremented by 1. The value of `ww % 2 == 1` before the operation determines the state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`. If `ww % 2 == 1` was true before decrementing, it becomes false, and if it was false, it becomes true. Therefore, if `ww % 2 == 1` was true before decrementing, `r` becomes 0, `pp` becomes `['H']`, and `h` becomes 1. If `ww % 2 == 1` was false before decrementing, `r` remains 1, `pp` remains `['R']`, and `h` remains unchanged.

Since the initial condition is not explicitly given for `ww % 2 == 1`, we consider both cases:

- If `ww % 2 == 1` was true initially: `r` becomes 0, `pp` becomes `['H']`, and `h` becomes 1.
- If `ww % 2 == 1` was false initially: `r` remains 1, `pp` remains `['R']`, and `h` remains unchanged.

However, since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `ww % 2 == 1`, we can only say that it changes its state from true to false or from false to true. 

Given this, the updated states are:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `ww` is decremented by 1, `r` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial state of `ww % 2 == 1`, `pp` is `['H']` if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was true and `['R']` if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was false, and `h` is 1 if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was true and unchanged if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was false.**
