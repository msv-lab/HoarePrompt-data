Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively. If `nn % 2 == 1`, then `pp` is `['R']`; otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing the value `'H'`.***
