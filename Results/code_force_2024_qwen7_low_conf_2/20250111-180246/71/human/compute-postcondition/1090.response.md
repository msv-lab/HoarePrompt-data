`pp.append('R')` adds the string 'R' to the list `pp`. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `pp` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`rr[3]` is increased by 1, `l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `r` is 2, `pp` is `[<initial content of pp>, 'R']`, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.**
