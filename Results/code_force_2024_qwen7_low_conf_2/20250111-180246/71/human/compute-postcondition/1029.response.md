`h` is incremented by 1. Since the initial state of `h` depends on `ww % 2 == 1`, this condition determines whether `h` was initially 0 or 1. However, after the code executes, `h` will be the original value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, `h` is the initial value of `h` plus 1.**
