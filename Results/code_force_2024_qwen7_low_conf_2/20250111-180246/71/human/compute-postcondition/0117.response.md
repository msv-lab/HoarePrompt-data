Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E'. If `hh[2]` is a non-zero value, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `r < h`, then `r` is `r + 1`, `hh` remains unchanged at index 3, and `pp` is ['R']. If `r` is not less than `h`, then `hh` at index 3 is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].**
