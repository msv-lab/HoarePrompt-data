The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The initial values of the variables are as follows: `l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `rr[0]` is reduced by 1, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the current state of `r`, `pp` is updated by appending `'R'`, and `r` is equal to `rr[0]`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `rr[0]` is reduced by 1, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the current state of `r`, `pp` is `['R']`, and `r` is equal to `rr[0] - 1`**
