The code appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is not mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is an empty list before this operation. The value of `i` remains unchanged as the code does not affect it. All other conditions and values of the variables remain as they were.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', and (not nn), and (not rr[1]), and `hh[1]` is False; `h` is incremented by 1; `pp` is ['H']**
