Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in `l`. After executing the if-else block, `nn` is always 0, `ss` is always 0, `ww` is `w - e` if `w > e`, otherwise `ww` is 0, and `ee` is `e - w` if `w <= e`, otherwise `ee` is 0.***
