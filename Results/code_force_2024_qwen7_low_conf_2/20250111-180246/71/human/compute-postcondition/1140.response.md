Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list, and `ww % 2 == 1` determines the state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`. 

If `rr[0]` is true, then `rr[0]` is reduced by 1, `pp` is `['R']`, and `r` is equal to `rr[0] - 1`.

Otherwise, if `hh[0]` is true, then `hh[0]` is reduced by 1, `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`, and `h` is increased by 1.

If `r < h`, then `r` is incremented by 1, `pp` contains one additional element `'R'`, and `rr[1]` is incremented by 1.

If `r >= h`, then `pp` is the original list plus `'H'`, `hh[1]` is increased by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1.***
