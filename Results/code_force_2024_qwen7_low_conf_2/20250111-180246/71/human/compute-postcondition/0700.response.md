`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The value of `rr[2]` is reduced by 1, and `r` is increased by 1. The condition for the loop to execute again depends on the remaining characters in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`rr[2]` is reduced by 1, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` contains the additional element `'R'`**
