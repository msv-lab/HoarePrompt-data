`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The initial state does not specify what `pp` is, but since it is not mentioned that `pp` exists initially, we can assume `pp` is an empty list before this operation. After appending `'H'` to the list, `pp` will contain the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', the condition `nn` is false, and `h` is 1; `pp` is ['H']**
