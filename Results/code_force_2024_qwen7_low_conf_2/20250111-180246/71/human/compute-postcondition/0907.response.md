The value of `h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `h` is not specified in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'E' and the current value of `i` is 'N', `hh[1]` is 0; `h` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'E' and the current value of `i` is 'N', `hh[1]` is 0; `h` is increased by 1**
