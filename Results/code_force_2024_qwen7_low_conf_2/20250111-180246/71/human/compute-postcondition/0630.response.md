The code snippet `hh[1] -= 1` decrements the second element of the list `hh` by 1. Since no specific values were given for `hh` in the initial state, we will assume that `hh` is a list and the second element (index 1) is being modified.

Let's denote the initial value of `hh[1]` as `v`. After executing the code, `hh[1]` will be `v - 1`.

Output State: **`hh[1]` is `hh[1] - 1`**
