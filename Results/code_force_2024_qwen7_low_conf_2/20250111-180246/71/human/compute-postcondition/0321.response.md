`r` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `r` is 1 or 2, so incrementing by 1 means `r` becomes 2 or 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2 or 3, `h` is 1 or 2, `rr` is one of `[0, False, 1, True]`, `[1, False, 1, True]`, or `[-1, False, 1, True]`, `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is one of ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H'] based on the values of `r` and `h`, and `i` is 'E'**
