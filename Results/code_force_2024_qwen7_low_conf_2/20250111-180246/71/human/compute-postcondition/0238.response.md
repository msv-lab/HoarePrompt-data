The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined in the given state, it implies that `pp` is being created as an empty list before the append operation. After appending `'R'`, the list `pp` will contain the element `'R'`.

The other variables (`l`, `ww`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `ee`, `nn`, `ss`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is ['R']**
