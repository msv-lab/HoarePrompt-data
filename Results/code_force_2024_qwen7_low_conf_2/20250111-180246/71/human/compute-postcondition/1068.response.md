The code snippet appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. This operation does not affect the values of `l`, `i`, `ww`, `r`, `pp`, `h`, and `rr`. The only changes are in the lists `pp` and `rr`.

- `l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before).
- `i` is the next element in the list.
- `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`.
- `rr` is the same list as before but `rr[2]` is increased by 1; `r` is increased by 1.
- `pp` now contains an additional element `'R'` at its end.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is the same list as before with an additional element `'R'`, `h` is determined by `ww % 2 == 1`, `rr` is the same list as before but `rr[2]` is increased by 1; `r` is increased by 1.**
