`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `ww` is False, `hh[3]` is 1, `rr[3]` is False, and `pp` contains the value `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `ww` is False, `hh[3]` is 1, `rr[3]` is False, `pp` contains the value `'H'`**
