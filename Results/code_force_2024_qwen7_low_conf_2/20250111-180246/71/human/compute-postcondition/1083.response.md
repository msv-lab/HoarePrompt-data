`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `l` is reduced by one element, meaning `l` now has one less element than before. The value of `i` remains as the next element in the list. The initial state of `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`. The values of `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`. The value of `rr[2]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list with one less element than before, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is increased by 1, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`, and `rr[2]` is a value 1 less than its previous value.**
