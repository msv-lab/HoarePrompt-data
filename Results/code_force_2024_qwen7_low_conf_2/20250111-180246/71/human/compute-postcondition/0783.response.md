The code `e += 1` increments the value of `e` by 1. Since `e` was initially 0, after executing this line, `e` becomes 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is 0, `s` is 0, `w` is 0, `e` is 1, `i` is not 'W'**
