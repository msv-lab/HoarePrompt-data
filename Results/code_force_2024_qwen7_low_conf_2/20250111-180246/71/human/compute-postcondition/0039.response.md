The variable `i` is initialized to 0, which means `i` is assigned the value 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5, `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `count_north` is the total number of 'N' in `s`, `count_south` is the total number of 'S' in `s`, `count_east` is the total number of 'E' in `s`, `count_west` is the total number of 'W' in `s`, `count_north` equals `count_south` and `count_east` equals `count_west`; `result` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
