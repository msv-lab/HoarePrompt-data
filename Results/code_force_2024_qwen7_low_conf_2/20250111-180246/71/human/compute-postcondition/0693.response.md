The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The variables `l` and `r` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the only change is to the list `pp`.

Output State: **the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `r` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list with an additional element `'R'` appended to it**
