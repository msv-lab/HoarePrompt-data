Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is either `[<initial content of pp>, 'R']` or the original list with `'H'` appended, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`, and `r` is 2 or `h` is increased by 1 depending on the condition `r < h`.**
