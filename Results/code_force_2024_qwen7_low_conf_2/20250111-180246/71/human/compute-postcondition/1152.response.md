Postcondition: ***`l` is an empty list, `_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in `l`. If the condition `(nn % 2 == 1 or ss % 2 == 1 or ww % 2 == 1 or (ee % 2 == 1))` is true, 'NO' is printed, and `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, and `ee` are 0. Otherwise, `l` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in `l` before the loop started, `r` is the total number of 'W' and 'E' in `l` with parity conditions applied, `pp` is a list of the final sequence of 'R' and 'H' based on the operations performed, `h` is the total number of 'E' and 'N' in `l` with parity conditions applied, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, `ss` are 0, and if `r` and `h` are both non-zero, `pp` is printed as a single string. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
