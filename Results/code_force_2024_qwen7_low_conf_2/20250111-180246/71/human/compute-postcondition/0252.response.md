In the initial state, the variables are as follows:
- `l` is "WEN"
- `ww` is 3
- `r` is 1
- `h` is 1
- `rr` is [0, False, 1, False]
- `hh` is [False, False, 0, False]
- `ee` is 0
- `nn` is 2
- `ss` is False

The code snippet is:
```python
hh[0] += 1
```

This line increments the first element of the list `hh` by 1. Since `hh` was initially `[False, False, 0, False]`, the first element `hh[0]` is `False`. Incrementing `False` by 1 in Python results in `1`.

After executing this line of code, the updated state of the variables is:
- `l` is "WEN"
- `ww` is 3
- `r` is 1
- `h` is 1
- `rr` is [0, False, 1, False]
- `hh` is [1, False, 0, False]
- `ee` is 0
- `nn` is 2
- `ss` is False

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [1, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
