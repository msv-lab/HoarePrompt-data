Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and r % 2 == 0 and (ee % 2 == 0)`, `rr` is `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[1, 0, 0, 0]`, `pp` is `['H']`, and the current character being processed is 'N'. If `rr[1]` is true, then `r` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.***
