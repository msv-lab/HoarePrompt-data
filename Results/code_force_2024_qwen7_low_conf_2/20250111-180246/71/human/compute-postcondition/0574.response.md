Postcondition: ***`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` are as follows:
- If the current character is 'E', `ee` is either `e - 1` and is odd, or `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`. `m` remains unchanged. `r` is `0` if `ee` is even, `1` if `ee` is odd and `r < h`, or `0` if `r >= h`. `h` is `1` if `r < h` and `h` was initially `0`, `2` if `r >= h` and `h` was initially `0`. `rr[2]` is `0` if `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and r % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0`, otherwise `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]` if `r < h` or a list of zeros otherwise. `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 1]` if `r < h` and `h` was initially `0`, or `[0, 0, 0, 2]` if `r >= h` and `h` was initially `0`. `pp` is `['R']` if `r < h` or `['H']` if `r >= h`.
- If the current character is not 'E', `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`. `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`. `m` remains unchanged. `r` and `h` represent different states based on the condition involving the parities of `nn` and `ss`. `rr` and `hh` are lists updated based on the parities of `nn` and `ss`. `pp` is either `['R']` or `['H']` based on the new parity of `nn`. If the current character is 'N', `nn` is decremented by 1 and its parity is considered, updating `r`, `h`, `rr`, and `hh` accordingly. If the current character is 'S', `r` and `h` are determined based on the parity of `ss`, and `rr` and `hh` are updated accordingly.***
