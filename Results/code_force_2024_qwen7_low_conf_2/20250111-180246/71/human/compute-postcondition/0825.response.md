`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it is considered an empty list before this operation. After appending `'R'`, `pp` becomes `['R']`. The other variables `l`, `i`, `ww`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `(ww)` is true, and `r` is 1; `pp` is ['R']**
