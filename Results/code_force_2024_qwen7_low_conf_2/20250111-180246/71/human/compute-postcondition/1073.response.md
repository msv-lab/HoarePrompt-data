Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list. `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is modified based on the following conditions: if `hh[3]` is True and `r < h`, then `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['R']; if `hh[3]` is False and `r < h`, then `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['H']; otherwise, `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['H']. `h` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `rr[2]` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1. `r` is increased by 1 regardless of the condition, and `hh[3]` is decreased by 1.***
