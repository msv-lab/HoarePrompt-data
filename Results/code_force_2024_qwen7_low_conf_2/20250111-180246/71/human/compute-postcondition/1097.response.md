Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list. `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list containing at least the original elements plus either `'R'` or `'H'`, and `h` is increased by 1. If `rr[2]` is true, `r` is increased by 1 and `rr[2]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged, and `pp` is either `[<original content of pp>, 'R']` or the original list with `'H'` appended.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes from both the if and else parts of the if-else block, summarizing the final state of the variables `l`, `i`, `r`, `pp`, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` after the execution of the if-else block.
