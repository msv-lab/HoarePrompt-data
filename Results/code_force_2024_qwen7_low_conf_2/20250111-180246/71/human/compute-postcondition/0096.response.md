`ee` is decremented by 1. Since `ee` was initially set to `True`, which is treated as `1` in arithmetic operations, `ee` will now be `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `ee` is 0, `r` is 1 and `pp` is ['R'], `h` is 1 and `pp` is ['H'].

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `ee` is 0, `r` is 1 and `pp` is ['R'], `h` is 1 and `pp` is ['H']**
