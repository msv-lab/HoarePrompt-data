The code snippet `pp.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Initially, `pp` is not mentioned in the state, so we assume it is an empty list before this operation. After appending 'H', `pp` becomes `['H']`.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [-1, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is ['H']**
