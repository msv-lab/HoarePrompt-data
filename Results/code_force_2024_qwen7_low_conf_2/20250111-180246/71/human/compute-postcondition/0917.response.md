`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The first element of the list `l` is incremented by 1, `i` is 'N', and `h` is increased by 1. After executing the code, the list `l` remains a non-empty list with its first element incremented by 1, `i` remains 'N', and `h` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list with its first element incremented by 1, `i` is 'N', and `h` is increased by 1; pp contains the value `'H'`**
