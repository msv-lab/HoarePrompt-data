The code `pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it means that `pp` is being created as an empty list before this line of code is executed.

After executing the code, the list `pp` will contain one element, which is `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is ['R']**
