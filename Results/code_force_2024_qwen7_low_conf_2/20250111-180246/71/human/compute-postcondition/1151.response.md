Postcondition: ***`l` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in `l` before the loop started, `r` is the total number of 'W' and 'E' in `l` with parity conditions applied, `pp` is a list of the final sequence of 'R' and 'H' based on the operations performed, `h` is the total number of 'E' and 'N' in `l` with parity conditions applied, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, `ss` are 0, `rr` and `hh` are lists where each element is either 0 or 1. If `r` and `h` are both non-zero, `pp` is printed as a single string. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'.***
