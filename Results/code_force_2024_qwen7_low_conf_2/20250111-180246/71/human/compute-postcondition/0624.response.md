`pp.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `pp`. Since no specific value was given for `pp` in the initial state, we can denote `pp` as a list that now includes 'H'. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `hh + 1`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` is ['H']**
