`count_south` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count_south` is 1, so after the increment, `count_south` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'; `count_north` is 0; `count_south` is 2; `count_east` is 0; `count_west` is 0; the character `char` is 'S'.
