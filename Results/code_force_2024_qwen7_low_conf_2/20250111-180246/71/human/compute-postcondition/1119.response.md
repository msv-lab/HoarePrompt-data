Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee`, `nn - 1`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`. If `nn - 1 % 2 == 1`, then `pp` contains all its previous elements plus the string `'R'`, and `r` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `h` is equal to its previous value plus 1, and `pp` contains an additional element `'H'`. If `nn` becomes 0, `pp` is reduced to `['R']` when `rr[1]` is true, and `r` is increased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `hh[1]` is reduced by 1. Otherwise, depending on the condition `hh[1]`, `pp` either contains all its previous elements plus `'H'` and `h` is increased by 1, or `pp` contains its original elements plus either `'R'` or `'H'`. If `r < h`, then `hh[0]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `hh[0]` is increased by 2, `h` is increased by 1, and `r` remains unchanged. Both `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.***
