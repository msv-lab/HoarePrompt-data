`h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `h` was only described as being increased by 1, not what it was increased from. The values of `l`, `i`, `ww % 2 == 1`, `pp`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.

Output State: **`hh[0]` is increased by 2, `l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` is increased by 1, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.**
