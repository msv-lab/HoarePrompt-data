`pp` is a list that gets appended with the value 'R'. The initial state mentions `r` is `r + 1`, but this does not affect the list `pp`. Therefore, after executing the code, the value of `r` remains unchanged from its initial state, and the list `pp` is updated by adding the element 'R' to it.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`; `pp` is `[ 'R' ]`**
