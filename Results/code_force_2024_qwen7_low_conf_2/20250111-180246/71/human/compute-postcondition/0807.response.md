`nn` is assigned the value `0`, and `ss` is assigned the value `s - n`. The previous values of `s` and `n` are used in the calculation for `ss`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in `l`, `nn` is 0, `ss` is `s - n`, `n` is less than or equal to `s**
