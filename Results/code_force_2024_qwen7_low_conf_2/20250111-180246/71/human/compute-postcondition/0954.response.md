Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is a string other than 'N' and 'S'. If the first element of `rr` is True, then `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` is ['R']. Otherwise, if the first element of `hh` is 1, then `pp` is ['H']. If `r < h`, then `rr[1]` is incremented by 1, `pp` is a list with an additional element `'R'`, and the value of `r` is less than `h` + 1. If `r >= h`, then `h` is incremented by 1, the second element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].**
