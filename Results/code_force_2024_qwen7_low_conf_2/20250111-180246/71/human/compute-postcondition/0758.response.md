Postcondition: ***The list `l` must still have at least one more character to proceed. If `i` equals 'S', then `ss` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1 if `ss` was odd, otherwise `h` is increased by 1; `pp` is either `[R]` or contains 'H'. If `rr[0]` is true, then `rr[0]` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains as a list containing the element 'R'. Otherwise, `hh[0]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains 'H'. If `r < h`, then `rr[1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `hh[1]` is incremented by 1. Since there is no else part, these changes are the final state of the program.***
