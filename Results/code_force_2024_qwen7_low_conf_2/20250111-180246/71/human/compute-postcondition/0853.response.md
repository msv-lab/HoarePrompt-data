Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W'. If `ww` is initially true, `r` is 0 or 1 depending on the initial state of `ww % 2 == 1`, `pp` is `['H']` if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was true and `['R']` if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was false, and `h` is 1 if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was true and unchanged if initially `ww % 2 == 1` was false. If `ww` is initially false, `r` is 0, `pp` is `['R']` if `rr[3]` is true and `['H']` if `rr[3]` is false. If `rr[3]` is false, then `hh[3]` is 1. If `r` is less than `h`, `rr[2]` is one more than its original value, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element 'R'. Otherwise, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is `['H']`.***
