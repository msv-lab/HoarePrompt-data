The code `e += 1` increments the value of `e` by 1. Given that `e` is 2 if `i` is 'E' and 0 otherwise, the new value of `e` will be 1 if `i` is 'E', and 1 if `i` is not 'E'. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is 2 if `i` is 'N', and 1 if `i` is not 'N', `s` is 2 if `i` is 'S', and 1 otherwise, `w` is 2 if `i` is 'W', and 1 otherwise, `e` is 1 if `i` is 'E', and 1 otherwise, and `i` is the next element in the list `l`.**
