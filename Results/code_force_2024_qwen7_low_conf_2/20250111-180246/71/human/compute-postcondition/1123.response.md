`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The value of `i` is the next element in the list `l`, and since `l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` remains unchanged. The value of `ww % 2 == 1` is true, and the values of `r`, `pp`, and `h` satisfy `ww % 2 == 1`. The values of `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`, and `h` is increased by 1. The state of `l` and the other variables remain as per the precondition.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` is true, `r`, `pp` now includes `'H'`, and `h` is increased by 1.**
