`r` is incremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr[1]` is increased by 1, and `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers respectively; `r` is increased by 1.
