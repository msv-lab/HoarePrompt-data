`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the next element in the list `l`, and the initial state of `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`. The values of `ee` and `nn` remain unchanged, and `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is incremented by 1, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is incremented by 1, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.**
