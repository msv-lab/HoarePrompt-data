`pp` is appended with the value 'R'. The value of `r` is incremented by 1, and the value of `rr[3]` is decremented by 1. The condition for the loop continues as long as there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed. 

Output State: **the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `r` is incremented by 1, `rr[3]` is `rr[3] - 1`; `pp` contains the value 'R'**
