In the given code snippet, `hh[0]` is incremented by 1. The value of `hh[0]` is updated, while the values of other variables remain unchanged from the initial state.

Let's denote the initial value of `hh[0]` as `val`. After executing `hh[0] += 1`, the new value of `hh[0]` will be `val + 1`.

Output State: **`hh[0]` is `val + 1`, other variables are as per the initial state**
