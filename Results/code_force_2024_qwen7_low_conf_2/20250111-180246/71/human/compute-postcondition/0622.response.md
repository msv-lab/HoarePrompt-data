`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The value of `r` is increased by 1, but since no initial value was given for `r`, we only know that `r` is increased by 1. The state of the list `pp` is updated with the addition of the string `'R'`.

Output State: **`r` is increased by 1; `pp` is a list containing the elements before the append operation plus the string `'R'`**
