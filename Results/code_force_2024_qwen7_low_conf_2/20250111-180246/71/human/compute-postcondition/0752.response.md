`h` is incremented by 1. The loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed. The precondition that `hh[1]` is increased by 1 is still valid.

Output State: **`hh[1]` is increased by 1, `h` is `h` + 1, the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed.**
