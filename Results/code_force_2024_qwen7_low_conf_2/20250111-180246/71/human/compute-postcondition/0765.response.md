Postcondition: **`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` are such that:
- `n`, `s`, `w`, `e` are the counts of 'N', 'S', 'W', and 'E' in the string `l`.
- `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` are the final values derived from the operations during the loop.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `l` is the input string.
- Either `r` or `h` (or both) is False.**
   
This postcondition includes all the variables from the precondition and explicitly states that the condition `(r and h)` is false, meaning the program entered the else block.
