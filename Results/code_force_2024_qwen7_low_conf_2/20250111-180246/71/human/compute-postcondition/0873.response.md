The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. However, the variable `h` is not mentioned in the initial state, and it is not clear if there was a previous value for `h`. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `h` after the increment. The only thing we know for certain is that `h` has been incremented by 1.

The states of the other variables (`l` and `i`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', `h` is incremented by 1**
