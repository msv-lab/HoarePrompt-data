`w` is incremented by 1, and the value of `i` is the next element in the list `l`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is 1 if `i` is 'N', and `n` is 0 otherwise, `s` is 1 if `i` is 'S', and `s` is 0 otherwise, `w` is 2 (since `w` was 1 and was incremented by 1), `e` is 1 if `i` is 'E', and `e` is 0 otherwise, and `i` is the next element in the list `l`.**
