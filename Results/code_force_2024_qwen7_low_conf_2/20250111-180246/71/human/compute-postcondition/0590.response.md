The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was initially in its original state, after executing this line, `r` will have its original value plus 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rr[2]` is `rr[2] + 1`, `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r` is original value + 1, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` are as they were initially.**
