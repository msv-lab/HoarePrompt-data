`r` is incremented by 1. The original value of `r` is 1, so the new value of `r` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [1, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [1, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
