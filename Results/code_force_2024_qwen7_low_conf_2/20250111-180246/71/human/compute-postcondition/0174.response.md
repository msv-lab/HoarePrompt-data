`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The initial state includes that `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', 'W', or 'E', and the conditions `(ss)`, `(rr[0])`, and `(hh[0])` are false. The value of `h` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `i` is not 'N', 'W', or 'E', `(ss)` is false, `(rr[0])` is false, `(hh[0])` is false, `h` is `h + 1`, and `pp` contains ['H']**
