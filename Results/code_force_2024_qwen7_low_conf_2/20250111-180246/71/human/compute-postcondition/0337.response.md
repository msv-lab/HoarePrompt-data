The value of `r` is incremented by 1. Given the initial condition that `r` is either 1 or 2, adding 1 to `r` will result in `r` being 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1 or 2, `rr` is [0, -1, 1, False], [1, -1, 1, False], or [-1, -1, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is one of ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H'] based on the values of `r` and `h`, `i` is 'E'**
