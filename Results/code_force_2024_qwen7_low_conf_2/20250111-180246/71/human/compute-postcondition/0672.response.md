`h` is incremented by 1. The condition for the loop to proceed is still dependent on the list `l` having at least one more character and the conditions for the current character `i` allowing the loop to proceed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **The loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `h` is incremented by 1.**
