`r` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `r < h` holds true, so this condition remains valid after the increment. The values of `l`, `i`, and `rr[0]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `rr[0]` is the original value of `rr[0]`, `r` is `r + 1`, and `r < h` holds true.**
