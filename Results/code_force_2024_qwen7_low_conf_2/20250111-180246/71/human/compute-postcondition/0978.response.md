The code snippet `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since no specific values are given for the variables `l`, `i`, `ww`, `ee`, `nn`, `hh`, `rr`, and `h`, we only need to focus on the changes made to `pp`.

- `l` remains a non-empty list.
- `i` is the next element in the list `l`.
- `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`.
- `ee` is a boolean variable.
- `nn` is a boolean variable.
- `hh` is a list with its third element incremented by 1.
- `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.
- `h` is even.

After executing the code, the list `pp` now contains one additional element `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is `pp` with `'H'` appended, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `hh` is a list with its third element incremented by 1, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, `h` is even.**
