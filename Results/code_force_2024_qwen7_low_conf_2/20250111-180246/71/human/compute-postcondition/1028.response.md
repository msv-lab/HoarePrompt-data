`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The value of `i` is the next element in the list `l`, which means `i` remains unchanged. `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`, and since `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `r` remains unchanged. `pp` is a list that now contains one additional element `'R'`. The states of the other variables (`ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh`) are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`, `pp` is a list containing one additional element `'R'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.**
