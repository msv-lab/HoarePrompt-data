`r` is incremented by 1. The loop condition remains the same, meaning the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed.

Output State: **`r` is `r + 1`, the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed.**
