`r` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `r` is given by `ww % 2 == 1`. The other variables remain unchanged based on the provided conditions.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before); `i` is the next element in the list; `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `r` is now `ww % 2 + 1`, `pp`, and `h`; `rr` is a list where the value at index 3 is decreased by 1; `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.**
