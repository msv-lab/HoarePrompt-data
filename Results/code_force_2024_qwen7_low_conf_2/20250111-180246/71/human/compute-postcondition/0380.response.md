The given code snippet prints the contents of the list `pp` using `''.join(pp)`. This does not change the values of any variables but instead outputs the concatenated string formed by the elements of `pp`.

The output of the program will be the string formed by joining all elements of `pp` together.

Output State: **`l` is the original non-empty string, `ww` is the absolute difference between the count of 'W' and 'S' in `l`, `ee` is the absolute difference between the count of 'E' and 'N' in `l`, `nn` is the absolute difference between the count of 'N' and 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the absolute difference between the count of 'S' and 'N' in `l`, `r` and `h` are both greater than 0, `r` is the number of 'R' or 'H' appended to `pp`, `h` is the number of 'H' appended to `pp`, `rr` is a list containing four elements where `rr[0]`, `rr[1]`, `rr[2]`, and `rr[3]` represent the number of 'R' and 'H' appended under certain conditions, `hh` is a list containing four elements where `hh[0]`, `hh[1]`, `hh[2]`, and `hh[3]` represent the number of 'R' and 'H' appended under certain conditions, and `pp` contains the sequence of 'R' and 'H' appended during each iteration, and the output of the print statement is the string formed by concatenating all elements in `pp`.**
