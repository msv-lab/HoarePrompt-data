`pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The initial state shows that `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `rr[0]` is the original value of `rr[0]`, and `r` is `r + 1` and `r < h` holds true. These conditions are not directly affected by the code. The only change is that the list `pp` now contains an additional element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `rr[0]` is the original value of `rr[0]`, `r` is `r + 1` and `r < h` holds true, `pp` is a list containing its original elements plus `'R'`**
