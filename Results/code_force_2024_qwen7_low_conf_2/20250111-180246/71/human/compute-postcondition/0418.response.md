Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`. Depending on the value of `i`:
- If `i` is 'N', then `n` is 3, `s` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'S', `w` is 2, `e` is 2.
- If `i` is 'W', then `w` is 3, `e` is 3, `s` is `s + 1` if `i` is 'S'.
- If `i` is 'E', then `w` is 2, `e` is 3, `s` is `s + 1` if `i` is 'S'.
- For any other character `i`, `n` is 2, `w` is 2, `e` is 2, `s` is `s + 1` if `i` is 'S'. All other variables retain their previous values or are reset accordingly.***
