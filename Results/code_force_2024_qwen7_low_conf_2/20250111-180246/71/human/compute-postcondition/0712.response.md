Postcondition: ***`l` is a list with at least one more character. `rr[2]` and `hh[2]` are decremented by 1, and `r` and `h` are incremented by 1. If `rr[2]` is not zero, `rr[3]` is incremented by 1. If `r < h`, then `rr[3]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `hh[3]` is incremented by 1. `pp` either contains the additional element `'R'` or is set to `['H']`. The loop can execute one more time based on the conditions of `rr[2]` and `hh[2]`.***
