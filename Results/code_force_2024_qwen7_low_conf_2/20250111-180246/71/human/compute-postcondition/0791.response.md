The value of `e` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `e` is 1 (since `i` is 'E' and `e` is 1 if `i` is 'E'), so after incrementing, `e` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is 1 if `i` is 'N', and `n` is 0 otherwise, `s` is 1 if `i` is 'S', and `s` is 0 otherwise, `w` is 1 if `i` is 'W', and `w` is 0 otherwise, `e` is now 2, and `i` is the next element in the list `l`.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is 1 if `i` is 'N', and `n` is 0 otherwise, `s` is 1 if `i` is 'S', and `s` is 0 otherwise, `w` is 1 if `i` is 'W', and `w` is 0 otherwise, `e` is 2, and `i` is the next element in the list `l`.**
