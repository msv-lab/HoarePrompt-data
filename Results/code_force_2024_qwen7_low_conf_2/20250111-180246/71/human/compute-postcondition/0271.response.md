In the initial state, we have:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww` is 3.
- `r` is 1.
- `h` is 1.
- `rr` is [0, False, 1, False].
- `hh` is [False, False, 0, False].
- `ee` is 0.
- `nn` is 2.
- `ss` is False.

The code snippet is:
```python
rr[1] += 1
```

Step-by-step analysis:
- `rr[1]` refers to the second element of the list `rr`.
- Initially, `rr[1]` is `False`.
- The code increments `rr[1]` by 1.

Since `False` is treated as `0` in arithmetic operations, incrementing `False` by 1 results in `True`.

Therefore, the updated value of `rr[1]` is `True`.

The output state after executing the code snippet is:
Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, True, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**.
