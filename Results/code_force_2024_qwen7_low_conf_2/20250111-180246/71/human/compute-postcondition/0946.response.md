`r` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `r` was less than `h`, so after incrementing, `r` is still less than `h`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'N' and is not 'S', the first element of `rr` is False, `rr[1]` is the initial value of `rr[1]` + 1, and the value of `r` is less than `h` (now incremented by 1).

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'N' and is not 'S', the first element of `rr` is False, `rr[1]` is the initial value of `rr[1]` + 1, and the value of `r` is less than `h` + 1**
