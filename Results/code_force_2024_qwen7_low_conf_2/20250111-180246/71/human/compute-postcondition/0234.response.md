Postcondition: ***`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 1 or 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, 1] or [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, 0] or [False, False, 0, 1], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, and `pp` is either ['R'] or ['H'] or ['H'].***

Explanation:
- The `if` part handles the case where `hh[2]` is non-zero. In this case, `h` increases by 1, and `hh[2]` decreases by 1. Additionally, `pp` is set to `['H']`.
- The `else` part handles the case where `hh[2]` is zero. Here, `r` can increase by 1 depending on whether `r` is less than `h` or not, and `hh[3]` becomes 1 if `r` is increased. If `r` is not increased, `hh[3]` remains 0. The value of `h` also increases by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.

Combining both parts, the final state of the variables after executing the if-else block can be summarized as above.
