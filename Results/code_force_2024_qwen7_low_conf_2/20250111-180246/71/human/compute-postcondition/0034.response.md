Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2⋅10^5, `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `count_north` is the total number of 'N' in `s`, `count_south` is the total number of 'S' in `s`, `count_east` is the total number of 'E' in `s`, `count_west` is the total number of 'W' in `s`**.

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over each character in the string `s`.
- For each character:
  - If the character is 'N', `count_north` is incremented.
  - If the character is 'S', `count_south` is incremented.
  - If the character is 'E', `count_east` is incremented.
  - If the character is 'W', `count_west` is incremented.
- Since the loop runs for each character in the string `s`, by the end of the loop, all occurrences of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' in the string `s` will have been counted.

Thus, after the loop finishes executing, `count_north` will be the total number of 'N' in `s`, `count_south` will be the total number of 'S' in `s`, `count_east` will be the total number of 'E' in `s`, and `count_west` will be the total number of 'W' in `s`.
