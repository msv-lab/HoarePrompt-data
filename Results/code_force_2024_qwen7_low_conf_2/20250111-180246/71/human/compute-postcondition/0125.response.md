The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initialized before this line of code, it will be created as an empty list and then the string `'R'` will be added to it. None of the other variables (`l`, `i`, `r`, and `nn`) are affected by this code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `r` is the original value of `r` + 1, `nn` is odd, `pp` is ['R']**
