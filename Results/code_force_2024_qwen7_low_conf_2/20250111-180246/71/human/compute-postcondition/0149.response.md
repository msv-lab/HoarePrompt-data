`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. This means that `pp` now contains the element `'H'`. The values of the other variables (`l`, `i`, `hh[0]`, `h`) remain unchanged. The conditions `(not nn)`, `(not rr[1])`, and `(r >= h + 1)` also remain valid.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', (not nn), (not rr[1]), and (r >= h + 1); hh[0] is increased by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
