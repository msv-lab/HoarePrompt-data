Postcondition: **`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is either `w - e` or `0` depending on the condition `w > e`, `ee` is either `0` or `e - w` depending on the condition `w > e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `0`, `h` is `0`, `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and ww % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0`, `rr` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `pp` is an empty list `[]`, the current value of `i` is 'W', `ww` is not `0`, and `ww` is odd**
