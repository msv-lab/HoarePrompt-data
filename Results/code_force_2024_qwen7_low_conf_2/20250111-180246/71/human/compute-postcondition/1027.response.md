`r` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `r` is determined by `ww % 2 == 1`. Since `i` is the next element in the list `l`, the value of `i` does not affect the increment operation. The states of the other variables (`ww`, `pp`, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh`) are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.**
