Postcondition: ***`_` is 1, `t` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list. If `i` is 'N', then `n` is 3, and `s`, `w`, and `e` retain their previous states. If `i` is not 'N', then `n` is 2, `s` is 2 if `i` is 'S', and 1 otherwise, `w` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'W', and `e` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'E'. `w` is 2 if `i` is 'W', and 1 otherwise, `e` is 2 if `i` is 'E', and 0 otherwise if `i` is neither 'W' nor 'E'. `i` is the next element in the list `l`.***
