Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh`. If `ss % 2 == 1`, then `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list with one additional element `'R'`. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged, `pp` now includes `'H'`, and `h` is increased by 1.***
