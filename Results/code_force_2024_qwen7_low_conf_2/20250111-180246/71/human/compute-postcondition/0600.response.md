The code appends the string 'R' to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not provide the exact value or content of `pp`, it is only known that the operation appends 'R' to it. The value of `r` remains unchanged from its previous state, which is one more than its previous value.

Output State: **`r` is one more than its previous value; `pp` is a list with the additional element 'R' appended to it**
