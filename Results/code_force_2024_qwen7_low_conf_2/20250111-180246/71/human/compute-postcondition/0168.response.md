`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `r` was previously unknown but now it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', `i` is not equal to 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W', `i` is not equal to 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, and the first element of `rr` is 0; `r` is increased by 1.
