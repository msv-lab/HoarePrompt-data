`r` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `r` is the previous value plus 1. The value of `i`, `ww % 2 == 1`, `pp`, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr[2]`, and `hh` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr[2]` is `x + 1` where `x` was the initial value of `rr[2]`, `r` is the previous value of `r` + 1, `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers.**
