Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before; `i` is the next element in the list; `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`; if `ww`, then `ww` is decremented by 1, `r` is set to 1, `pp` is a list containing one additional element `'H'`, and `h` is set to 1; otherwise, `r` is updated based on the following conditions: `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`; `pp` is updated based on the conditions: if `rr[3]` is True, `pp` is appended with `'R'`; if `hh[3]` is True and `r < h`, `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['R']; if `hh[3]` is False and `r < h`, `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['H']; otherwise, `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['H']. `h` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `rr[2]` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1. `r` is increased by 1 regardless of the condition, and `hh[3]` is decreased by 1; `hh` remains unchanged; `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` remain adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.**
