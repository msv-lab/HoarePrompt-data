`h` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `h` is 1, so after executing `h += 1`, the value of `h` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, -1], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
