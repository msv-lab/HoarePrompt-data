`pp` is a list to which the string 'R' is appended. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the value of `pp` changes to include 'R', while the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rr[2]` is `rr[2] + 1`, `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r` are original value + 1, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` are as they were initially, `pp` contains 'R'**
