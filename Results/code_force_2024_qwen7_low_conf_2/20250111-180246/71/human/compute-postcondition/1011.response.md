The code `rr[1] -= 1` decrements the value at index 1 of the list `rr` by 1. Since `rr` is a list containing boolean values, decrementing it by 1 will result in `-1` (since boolean values are treated as integers: `True` is `1` and `False` is `0`). The initial value of `rr[1]` is not specified, but it will now be `-1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` is a list where the value at index 1 is `-1`, and `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers respectively.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` is a list where the value at index 1 is `-1`, `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers respectively.**
