Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is either `w - e` or `0` depending on the condition `w > e`, `ee` is either `0` or `e - w` depending on the condition `w > e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `1` if `ww % 2 == 1`, `r` is `0` otherwise, `h` is `0` if `ww % 2 == 1`, `h` is `1` otherwise, `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and ww % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0` remains true, `rr` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `pp` is a list `['R']` if `ww % 2 == 1`, `pp` is `['H']` otherwise, the current value of `i` is 'W', and `ww` is not `0`.***
