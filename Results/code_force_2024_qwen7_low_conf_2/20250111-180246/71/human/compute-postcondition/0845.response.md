The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined in the given state, it must be a new list created by this operation. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `ww` is False, `rr[3]` remains False, `rr[2]` is one more than its original value, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing the element 'R'.**
