`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated state is that `pp` now includes the string `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r` and `pp`, `h` is incremented by 1, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, and `pp` is a list containing the value `'H'`.**
