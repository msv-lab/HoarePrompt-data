`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. This means that `pp` now contains one more element, which is `'H'`. All other variables remain unchanged based on their initial state.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively; `hh[1]` is increased by 1, `h` is `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`, `pp` is a list containing `'H'`.**
