Postcondition: ***`l` is the original non-empty string, `ww` is the absolute difference between the count of 'W' and 'S' in `l`, `ee` is the absolute difference between the count of 'E' and 'N' in `l`, `nn` is the absolute difference between the count of 'N' and 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the absolute difference between the count of 'S' and 'N' in `l`. If both `r` and `h` are greater than 0, then `r` and `h` are decremented by 1 each, and 'R' and 'H' are appended to `pp`. `rr` and `hh` represent the number of 'R' and 'H' appended under certain conditions. If either `r` or `h` is 0, then `r` or `h` remains unchanged, and the sequence of 'R' and 'H' appended to `pp` remains as in `pp`. The output of the print statement is the string formed by concatenating all elements in `pp`.***
