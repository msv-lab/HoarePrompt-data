Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions and Loop Setup**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in the list `l`.
   - Each element `i` in `l` represents a direction ('N', 'S', 'W', 'E').

2. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - Variables like `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` are defined based on the conditions given.

3. **Loop Body Impact**:
   - Depending on the current character `i` (which is an element from `l`), different conditions and updates apply to the variables `ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp`.

4. **Conditions for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute again, the next element `i` must be valid and the conditions for updating the variables must hold true.

Given the current state and the nature of the loop, let's consider the possible next iterations:

### Case Analysis Based on Current Character

#### Case 1: Current Character is 'W'
- If the current character is 'W':
  - `ww` changes based on the condition `w > e`.
  - `ee` changes based on the condition `w > e`.
  - `r` and `h` are updated based on the new values of `ww` and `ee`.
  - `rr` and `hh` are updated based on the values of `r` and `h`.
  - `pp` is updated based on the parity of `ww`.

For the loop to continue with 'W':
- `ww` must be either `w - e - 1` or `0` if `w > e`.
- `ee` must be either `0` or `e - w` if `w > e`.
- `r` must be `1` if `ww % 2 == 1` and `ww` is not `0`.
- `h` must be `0` if `ww % 2 == 1` and `ww` is not `0`.

#### Case 2: Current Character is 'E'
- If the current character is 'E':
  - `ee` changes based on the condition `w > e`.
  - `m` remains unchanged.
  - `r` and `h` are updated based on the new value of `ee`.
  - `rr` and `hh` are updated based on the values of `r` and `h`.
  - `pp` is updated based on the value of `r`.

For the loop to continue with 'E':
- `ee` must be odd if `w > e`.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `r` must be `0` if `ee` is even.
- `h` must be updated based on the new values of `r` and `h`.

#### Case 3: Current Character is 'N'
- If the current character is 'N':
  - `nn` is decremented by 1.
  - `r` and `h` are updated based on the new value of `nn`.
  - `rr` and `hh` are updated based on the values of `r` and `h`.
  - `pp` is updated based on the parity of `nn`.

For the loop to continue with 'N':
- `nn` must be decremented by 1.
- `r` and `h` must be updated based on the new value of `nn`.

#### Case 4: Current Character is 'S'
- If the current character is 'S':
  - `r` and `h` are updated based on the parity of `ss`.
  - `rr` and `hh` are updated based on the values of `r` and `h`.
  - `pp` is updated based on the value of `r`.

For the loop to continue with 'S':
- `ss` must have its parity considered.
- `r` and `h` must be updated based on the parity of `ss`.
- `rr` and `hh` must be updated based on the new values of `r` and `h`.

### Conclusion

Since the next character `i` is an element of `l`, we need to ensure the conditions for the next character to be valid. Given the complexity, we need to ensure that the next character maintains the integrity of the conditions described.

**State at the start of the next iteration**:
- The specific values of `ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` depend on the current character `i`.
- The general conditions are that the next character must be a valid direction ('W', 'E', 'N', 'S') and the conditions for updating the variables must hold.

**State**: **`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` are as follows:
- If the next character `i` is 'W', the conditions for `ww`, `ee`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are as described above.
- If the next character `i` is 'E', the conditions for `ee`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are as described above.
- If the next character `i` is 'N', the conditions for `nn`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are as described above.
- If the next character `i` is 'S', the conditions for `ss`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are as described above.

Thus, the state remains the same but with the conditions adjusted based on the next character `i`.
