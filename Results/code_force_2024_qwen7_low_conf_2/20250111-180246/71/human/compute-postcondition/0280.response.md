Postcondition: ***`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is either 1 or 2, `h` is either 1 or 2, `rr` is one of [0, False, 1, False], [-1, False, 1, False], or [0, True, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False] or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, and `pp` is either ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H'] based on the values of `r` and `h`, with the additional constraint that if `hh[2]` is non-zero, then `hh[3]` is unchanged, and if `hh[2]` is zero, then `hh[3]` is incremented.***
