`ee` is decremented by 1. Since `ee` can be either -1 or 0, decrementing by 1 will make `ee` equal to 0. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `ee` is 0, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `i` is 'E', `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 2 or 3, `rr` is one of [0, False, 1, False], [1, False, 1, False], or [-1, False, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `pp` is one of ['R', 'H'] or ['R', 'H', 'H']**
