`count_east` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` remains greater than 0, and the values of `s`, `count_north`, `count_west`, and `count_south` remain unchanged as no operations are performed on them in this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-2`, `count_east` is increased by 1, `count_north`, `count_west`, and `count_south` remain unchanged**
