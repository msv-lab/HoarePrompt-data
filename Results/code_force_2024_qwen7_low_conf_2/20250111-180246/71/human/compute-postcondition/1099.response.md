`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. This operation does not affect the values of `l`, `i`, `ww`, `r`, `pp`, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh`. The only change is the addition of the string `'R'` to the list `pp`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before); `i` is the next element in the list; `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`; `pp` contains all its previous elements plus the string `'R'`; `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`; `r` is increased by 1.**
