The code snippet `hh[0] -= 1` decrements the first element of the list `hh` by 1. This operation directly affects the value of `hh[0]`.

Given the initial state:
- `hh` is a list, and `hh[0]` is one of its elements.

After executing the code:
- `hh[0]` is decreased by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`hh[0]` is `hh[0] - 1`**
