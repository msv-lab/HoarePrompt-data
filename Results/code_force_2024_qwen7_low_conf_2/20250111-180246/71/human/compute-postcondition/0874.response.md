`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The initial state shows that `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', and `h` is incremented by 1. The code snippet does not affect the values of `l`, `i`, or the expression for `h`, but it adds `'H'` to the list `pp`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`**
