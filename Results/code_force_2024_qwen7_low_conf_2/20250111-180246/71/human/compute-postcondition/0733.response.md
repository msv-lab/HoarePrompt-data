Postcondition: ***`hh[1]` is decremented by 1 if `hh[1]` is greater than 0; otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1. `pp` is set to `['H']` if `hh[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise it is set to `[R]`. `r` is either `rr[0] + 1` if `r < h`, or `h` is incremented by 1 if `r >= h`. `hh[0]` is incremented by 1 if `r >= h`. The loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed.***
