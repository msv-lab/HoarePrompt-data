The code `pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. The initial state does not provide the exact value of `pp`, but since `pp` is a list and it's stated that `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `r` is increased by 1, `(ss)` is true and remains an odd number, these conditions remain unchanged. The only change is that `'R'` is appended to `pp`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'S', `r` is increased by 1, `(ss)` is true and remains an odd number, `pp` is a list with its last element being 'R'.**
