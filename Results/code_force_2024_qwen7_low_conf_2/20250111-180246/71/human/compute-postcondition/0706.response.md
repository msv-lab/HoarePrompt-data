`pp.append('R')` appends the string 'R' to the list `pp`. The previous state of `pp` was an empty list, so now it contains the element 'R'. The values of `rr[3]`, `r`, and the loop conditions are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `pp` is ['R'], `rr[3]` is incremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed.
