Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively. If `i == 'S'` is true, then based on certain conditions, `r`, `pp`, and `h` are updated as follows: 
- If `ss` is true, `pp` may contain an additional element `'R'` or `H`, and `h` is incremented by 1 if the else part executed.
- If `rr[0]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `hh` is a list where its first element is decremented by 1 and `hh[0]` is true, and `hh` and `rr` remain lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.
- If `rr[0]` is false, `pp` may contain an additional element `'H'` if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise `pp` remains unchanged. `hh` is a list where its first element is decreased by 1 if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise the first element of `hh` is increased by 1. If `hh[0]` is true, `h` is incremented by 1 based on `ww % 2 == 1`. If `hh[0]` is false, if `r < h`, then `pp` has an additional element `'R'` and `rr[1]` is increased by 1, otherwise `hh[1]` is increased by 1 and `h` is set to `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`.***
