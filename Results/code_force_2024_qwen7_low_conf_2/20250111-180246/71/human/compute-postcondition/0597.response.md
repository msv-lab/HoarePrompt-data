Postcondition: ***`rr[3]` is decremented by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'R' if `rr[3]` was initially true. If `rr[3]` is false, `hh[3]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list with an additional element `'H'` if `hh[3]` is true. If `r < h`, `rr[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains 'R'. If `r >= h`, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, and `h` is increased by 1. `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` retain their original values unless the above conditions are met.***

This summary captures the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering all the specified conditions and updates.
