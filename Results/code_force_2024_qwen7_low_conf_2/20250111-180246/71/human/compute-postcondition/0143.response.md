`rr[0]` is incremented by 1. The value of `rr[0]` was not specified initially, so we only know it has been increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', and (not nn), and (not rr[1]), `r` is less than `h`; `rr[0]` is increased by 1.
