`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The value of `hh[0]` is updated to `hh[0] - 1` and the value of `h` is updated to `h + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `hh[0]` is `hh[0] - 1`, `h` is `h + 1`, and `pp` contains the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`hh[0]` is `hh[0] - 1`, `h` is `h + 1`, and `pp` contains the element `'H'`**
