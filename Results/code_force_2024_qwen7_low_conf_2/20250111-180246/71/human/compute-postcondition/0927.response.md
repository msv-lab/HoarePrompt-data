`pp` is a list that appends the string `'R'`. The initial state does not provide the exact contents of `l`, `i`, or `r`, but it specifies that `pp` is a non-empty list. The code appends `'R'` to `pp`, which means `pp` will now contain all its original elements plus the new element `'R'`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, `r`, and `ss`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'S', the condition `(ss)` is true and `ss` is an odd number; `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing all its original elements plus the new element 'R'**
