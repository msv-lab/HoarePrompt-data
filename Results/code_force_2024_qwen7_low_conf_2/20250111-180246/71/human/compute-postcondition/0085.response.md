`count_east` is decremented by 1. Since `count_east` was not specified in the initial state and no specific value was given, we cannot determine the exact value of `count_east` after the operation. However, we know that `result` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `result` is a list containing ['R']; `count_east` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`result` is a list containing ['R']; `count_east` is decreased by 1**
