Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N'. If `r < h` holds true, then `pp` is a list containing its original elements plus `'R'`, `r` is incremented by 1, and `r < h` still holds. Otherwise, the first element of `l` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the value `'H'`**
