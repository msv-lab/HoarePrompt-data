The initial state indicates that `hh[0]` is `hh[0] - 1`. The code snippet increments the variable `h` by 1. Since the initial value of `hh[0]` is `hh[0] - 1`, the value of `hh[0]` remains `hh[0] - 1`. The value of `h` is now `1` more than its previous value.

Output State: **`hh[0]` is `hh[0] - 1`, `h` is `h + 1`**
