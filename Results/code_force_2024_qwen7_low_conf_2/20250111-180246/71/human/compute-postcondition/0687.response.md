`pp` is appended with the string `'H'`. This changes the value of `pp` from its previous state. The conditions for the loop to continue executing are still valid since no variables related to these conditions have been altered. The values of `h` and `hh[2]` remain unchanged.

Output State: **the loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed; `h` is increased by 1; `hh[2]` is increased by 1; `pp` is now a list containing the value `'H'` appended to its previous elements.**
