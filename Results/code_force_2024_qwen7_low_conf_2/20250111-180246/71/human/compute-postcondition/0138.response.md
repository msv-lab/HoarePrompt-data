`hh[1]` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `hh[1]` is true, but since boolean values in Python are treated as integers (where True is 1 and False is 0), decrementing True by 1 results in 0, which is equivalent to False. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', and (not nn), and (not rr[1]), and `hh[1]` is False**
