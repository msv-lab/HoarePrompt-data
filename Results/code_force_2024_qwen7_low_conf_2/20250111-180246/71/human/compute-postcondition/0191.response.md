Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string. If `i` equals 'W', `l` remains unchanged, `ww` is decreased by 1 if originally `(ww % 2 == 0)`, `r` is increased by 1 if originally `(ww % 2 == 0)` or `h` is set to 1 if originally `(ww % 2 == 1)`. If `rr[3]` is True, then `r` is 1, `pp` is ['R']. If `hh[3]` is True, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['H']. If `h` is not less than `r`, `hh[2]` is increased by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H']. If `hh[3]` is False and `r` is less than `h`, `rr[2]` remains 1, and `pp` is ['R']. If `i` does not equal 'W', `l` remains unchanged, and depending on the value of `i`:
- If `i` equals 'E' and `ee` is 0, then `r` is 1, `pp` is ['R'], `h` is 1, and `pp` is ['H'].
- If `rr[2]` is False, then `r` is 1, and `pp` is ['R'].
- If `hh[2]` is non-zero, then `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1.
- If `hh[2]` is zero and `r` is less than `h`, then `r` is incremented by 1, and `hh[3]` remains unchanged.
- If `r` is not less than `h`, then `hh[3]` is incremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].
- If `i` equals 'N' and `nn` is even, then `h` is 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `r` remains unchanged; if `nn` is odd, then `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `r` is increased by 1 if `r` is less than `h`; if `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, then `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `r` remains unchanged.
- If `i` equals 'S' and `ss` is true, then `ss` is decremented by 1, `r` remains unchanged, `h` remains unchanged, and `pp` is ['H']; if `ss` is false, then `pp` is updated based on the following conditions:
  - If the first element of `rr` is 0, then `pp` contains the value `'R'`.
  - If `(hh[0])` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` remains as ['H'].
  - If `r` is less than `h + 1`, then `rr[1]` is set to `True` and `pp` becomes ['R'].
  - Otherwise, `hh[1]` is incremented by 1 and `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains as ['H'].***
