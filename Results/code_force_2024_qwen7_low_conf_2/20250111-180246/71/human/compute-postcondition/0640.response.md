Postcondition: ***`hh[1]` is a boolean value, if `hh[1]` is `True`, then `hh[1]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing `'H'`. Otherwise, either `rr[0]` is `initial_value + 1` or `hh[0]` is `val + 1`, `r` is `initial_value + 2` or `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'`.***
