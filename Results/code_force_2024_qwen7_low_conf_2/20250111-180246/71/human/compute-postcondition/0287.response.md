The code snippet `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` is one of `['R']`, `['H']`, or `['R', 'H']` based on the values of `r` and `h`, appending `'R'` to `pp` will not change its content because `'R'` is already present in each possible list. Therefore, the value of `pp` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1 or 2, `rr` is one of [0, False, 1, False], [1, False, 1, False], or [-1, False, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is one of ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H'], and `i` is 'E'**
