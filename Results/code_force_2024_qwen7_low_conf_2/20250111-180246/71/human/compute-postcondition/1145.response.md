Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before; `i` is the next element in the list; `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`. If `i == 'W'`, then:
- `ww` is decremented by 1 if `ww` is greater than 0, `r` is set to 1, `pp` is a list containing one additional element `'H'`, and `h` is set to 1; otherwise, `r` is updated based on the following conditions: `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`; `pp` is updated based on the conditions: if `rr[3]` is True, `pp` is appended with `'R'`; if `hh[3]` is True and `r < h`, `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['R']; if `hh[3]` is False and `r < h`, `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['H']; otherwise, `pp` is the original `pp` plus ['H']. `h` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; `rr[2]` is increased by 1 if `r < h`; otherwise, `hh[2]` is increased by 1. `r` is increased by 1 regardless of the condition, and `hh[3]` is decreased by 1; `hh` remains unchanged; `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` remain adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.
- If `i == 'E'`, then `pp` contains at least the original elements plus either `'R'` or `'H'`, and `h` is increased by 1.
- If `i == 'N'`, then:
  - If `nn - 1 % 2 == 1`, `pp` contains all its previous elements plus the string `'R'`, and `r` is increased by 1.
  - If `nn - 1 % 2 != 1`, `h` is equal to its previous value plus 1, and `pp` contains an additional element `'H'`.
  - If `nn` becomes 0, depending on `rr[1]`, `pp` may be reduced to `['R']`, `r` may be increased by 1, `h` may be increased by 1, and `hh[1]` may be reduced by 1.
  - Depending on `hh[1]`, `pp` may contain all its previous elements plus `'H'` and `h` may be increased by 1, or `pp` may contain its original elements plus either `'R'` or `'H'`.
  - If `r < h`, `hh[0]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `hh[0]` is increased by 2, `h` is increased by 1, and `r` remains unchanged.
  - `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.
- If `i == 'S'`, then:
  - If `(ss - 1) % 2 == 1`, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list with one additional element `'R'`.
  - If `(ss - 1) % 2 != 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `pp` now includes `'H'`, and `h` is increased by 1.
  - If `rr[0]` is true, `rr[0]` is reduced by 1, `pp` is `['R']`, and `r` is equal to `rr[0] - 1`.
  - If `hh[0]` is true, `hh[0]` is reduced by 1, `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`, and `h` is increased by 1.
  - If `r < h`, `r` is incremented by 1, `pp` contains one additional element `'R'`, and `rr[1]` is incremented by 1.
  - If `r >= h`, `pp` is the original list plus `'H'`, `hh[1]` is increased by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1.
- If `i != 'S'`, no changes occur.***
