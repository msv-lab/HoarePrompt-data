Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is either `w - e - 1` or `0` depending on the condition `w > e`, `ee` is either `0` or `e - w` depending on the condition `w > e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `1` if `ww % 2 == 1` and `ww` is not `0`, `r` is `0` if `ww % 2 == 0` and `ww` is not `0`, `h` is `0` if `ww % 2 == 1` and `ww` is not `0`, `h` is `1` if `ww % 2 == 0` and `ww` is not `0`, `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and ww % 2 == 0 and ee % 2 == 0` may be true or false, `rr` is either `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, or `[0, 0, 0, 1]` depending on the value of `r` and `h`, `hh` is either `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `[0, 0, 1, 0]`, or `[0, 0, 0, 1]` depending on the value of `r` and `h`, `pp` is either `['H']` or `['R']` depending on the condition `ww % 2 == 0`, `i` is 'W' in all cases.***
