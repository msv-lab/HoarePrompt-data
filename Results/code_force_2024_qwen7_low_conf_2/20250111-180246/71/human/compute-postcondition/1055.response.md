The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. This operation does not affect the values of `r`, `l`, `i`, `ww % 2 == 1`, `pp`, or `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh`. The only change is that `pp` now contains one more element, which is `'R'`.

Output State: **`r` is `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`, `l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list containing one additional element `'R'`, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.**
