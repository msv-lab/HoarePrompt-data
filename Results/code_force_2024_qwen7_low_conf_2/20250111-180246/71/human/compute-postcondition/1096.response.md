Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list. `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list containing at least the original elements plus either `'R'` or `'H'`, and `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`. If `rr[2]` is true, `r` is increased by 1 and `rr[2]` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, `r` remains unchanged and `pp` is either `[<original content of pp>, 'R']` or the original list with `'H'` appended, and `h` is increased by 1 if `r < h`.**
