Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E'. Depending on the condition `ee`:
- If `ee` is true, `h` is increased by 1 if the new parity of `ee` is odd, `r` is increased by 1 if the new parity of `ee` is even, `ee` is decreased by 1, `pp` is either 'R' or ['H'] based on the new parity of `ee`, and the condition `(ee)` retains its truth value.
- If `ee` is false, `r` is increased by 1 if `rr[2]` is False, `pp` is ['R'] in this case. If `hh[2]` is True, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`. If `r` is less than `h`, `rr` is a list where the fourth element is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list with its last element being 'R'. Otherwise, `h` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains 'H'.***
