The code `w += 1` increments the value of `w` by 1. Given that `w` was initially 1 (based on the initial state where either `n`, `s`, `w`, or `e` is 1 and all others are 0), after executing this line, `w` will become 2. All other variables (`nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `l`, `i`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`, `w` is 2, `n` is 0, `s` is 0, `e` is 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ee` is 0**
