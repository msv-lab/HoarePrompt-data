The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Initially, `n` is 1 (since `n` is 1 if `i` is 'N', and `i` is the next element in the list `l`). After incrementing, `n` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is 2, `s` is 0, `w` is 0, `e` is 0, and `i` is the next element in the list `l`.**
