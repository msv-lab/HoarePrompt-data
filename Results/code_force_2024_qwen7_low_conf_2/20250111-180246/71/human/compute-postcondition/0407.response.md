The value of `e` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `i` is the next character in `l`, and either `n`, `s`, `w`, or `e` is 1, while all other variables (`nn`, `ss`, `ww`) remain 0. Since `e` was initially 1, after incrementing, `e` will now be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`, `e` is 2, `n` is 0, `s` is 0, `w` is 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ww` is 0**
