`pp` is appended with the value 'R', which means `pp` now contains the next element in the list `l`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list `l`, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` contains the next element in the list `l` followed by 'R', `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr[0]` is the original value of `rr[0]` decremented by 1, `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, and `r` is increased by 1.**
