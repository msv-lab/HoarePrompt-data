The code `result.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `result`. The initial state specifies that `result` is an empty list. After appending `'R'`, `result` will contain the element `'R'`.

The other variables (`n`, `s`, `count_north`, `count_south`, `count_east`, `count_west`, `i`, and the current value of `s[i]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `count_north` is the total number of 'N' in `s`, `count_south` is the total number of 'S' in `s`, `count_east` is the total number of 'E' in `s`, `count_west` is the total number of 'W' in `s`, `count_north` equals `count_south` and `count_east` equals `count_west`, `result` contains the element 'R', `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is 'N'**.
