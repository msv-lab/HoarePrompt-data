Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable. If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `hh[3]` is incremented by 1. If `r < h`, then `r` is the initial value of `ww % 2 == 1` plus 1 and `pp` contains the value `'R'`. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is a list containing the string `'H'`.***
