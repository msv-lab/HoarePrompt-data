Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r` and `h`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `pp` is a list. If `ee` is true, then `pp` contains an additional element `'R'` if `ee % 2 == 1` or `'H'` otherwise, and `r` and `h` are updated based on the new value of `ee % 2`. If `ee` is false, then if `rr[2]` is true, `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains an additional element `'R'`, and `hh`, `ee`, and `nn` remain unchanged. If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1. If `r < h`, then `r` is set to the initial value of `ww % 2 == 1` plus 1 and `pp` contains the string `'R'`. If `r >= h`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains the string `'H'`.**
