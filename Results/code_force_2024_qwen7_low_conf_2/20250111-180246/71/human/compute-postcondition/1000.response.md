`pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not previously defined, it is initialized as a new list containing the string `'H'`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers where the value at index 3 is incremented by 1, `h` is `h + 1`, `pp` is a list containing the string `'H'`.
