The code `pp.append('R')` adds the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not defined in the initial state, it is assumed to be a new empty list before this operation. After executing the code, the list `pp` will contain the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`rr` is `[a, b, c, d + 2]`, `pp` is `['R']`**
