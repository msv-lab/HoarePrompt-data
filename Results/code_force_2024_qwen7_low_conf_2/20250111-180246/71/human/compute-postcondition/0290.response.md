Postcondition: ***`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 1 or 2, `rr` is one of [0, False, 1, False], [1, False, 1, False], or [-1, False, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is one of ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H', 'H'], `i` is 'E'. If `ww` is odd (i.e., `ww % 2 == 1`), then `r` is 2 and `h` is 1 or 2, `pp` is one of ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H']. Otherwise, `r` is 1 or 2 and `h` is 2, `pp` is one of ['R', 'H'], ['H', 'H'], or ['R', 'H', 'H'].***
