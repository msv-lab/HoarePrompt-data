Postcondition: ***The loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed. If `ww` is true, then `ww` is decreased by 1. Otherwise, if `rr[3]` is true, then `rr[3]` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains the value 'R'. If `hh[3]` is true, then `hh[3]` is set to its previous value minus 1, `h` is set to its previous value plus 1, and `pp` is updated to a list containing the previous elements plus 'H'. If `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is incremented by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` contains the last element plus the new value `'R'`. If `r >= h`, then `h` is increased by 1, `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is updated to a list containing the value `'H'` appended to its previous elements.***
