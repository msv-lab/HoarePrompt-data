`count_west` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions for `n`, `s`, `count_north`, `count_south`, and `count_east` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0; `s` is a string of length `n-1` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'; `count_north` is updated based on the new character; `count_south` is updated based on the new character; `count_east` is incremented if the new character is 'E'; `count_west` is incremented if the new character is neither 'S' nor 'E'; `count_west` is incremented by 1.
