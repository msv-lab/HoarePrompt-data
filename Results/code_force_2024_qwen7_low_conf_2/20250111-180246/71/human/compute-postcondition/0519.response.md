The code snippet appends the character 'R' to the list `pp`. The initial state of `pp` is an empty list `[]`. After appending 'R', `pp` becomes `['R']`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is an input integer plus 1, `h` is `0`, `nn % 2 == 0 and ss % 2 == 0 and r % 2 == 0 and (ee % 2 == 0)`, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `pp` is `['R']`, the current character being processed is 'N'.**
