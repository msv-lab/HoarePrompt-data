The code appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. This changes the value of `pp`. No other variables are directly affected by this code.

- `l` remains a non-empty list with one element less than before.
- `i` remains the next element in the list.
- `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, which is now `ww % 2 + 1`.
- `pp` is updated by appending `'R'` to it.
- `hh` remains unchanged.
- `rr` remains a list where the value at index 3 is decreased by 1.
- `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` remain adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before); `i` is the next element in the list; `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `r` is now `ww % 2 + 1`; `pp` is `[... , 'R']` (where `...` represents the original elements of `pp`); `hh` remains unchanged; `rr` remains a list where the value at index 3 is decreased by 1; `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` remain adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.**
