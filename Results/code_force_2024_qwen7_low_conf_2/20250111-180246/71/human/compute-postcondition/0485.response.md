`pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was initially an empty list `[]`, after appending `'R'`, `pp` becomes `['R']`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `r + 1`, `h` is `0`, `rr[2]` is `0`, `hh` is `0`, `pp` is `['R']`.

Output State: **`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `r + 1`, `h` is `0`, `rr[2]` is `0`, `hh` is `0`, `pp` is `['R']`.**
