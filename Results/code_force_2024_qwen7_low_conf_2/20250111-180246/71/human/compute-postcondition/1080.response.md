Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`. If `ee % 2 == 1`, then `pp` is `['R']` and `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`. Otherwise, `pp` is `[...,'H']` (where `...` represents the original elements of the list `pp`), and `h` is increased by 1.***
