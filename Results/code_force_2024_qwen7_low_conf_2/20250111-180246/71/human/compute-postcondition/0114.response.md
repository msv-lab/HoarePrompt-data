The value of `h` is incremented by 1, but the initial value of `h` is not specified in the initial state. The other variables (`l`, `i`, and `hh`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh` is a list where the element at index 3 is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1**
