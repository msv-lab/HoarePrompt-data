The code snippet appends 'R' to the list `result`. Since `result` was previously a list containing either 'H', 'R', or a combination of these based on the value of `s[2]`, appending 'R' to this list will add 'R' to the list.

Given the initial conditions:
- \( n \) is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \)
- \( s \) is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length \( n \)
- \( count_north \) and \( count_south \) satisfy the condition where:
  - `count_north` equals `count_south + 1` (if `s[2]` is 'S')
  - `count_north` equals `count_south - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N')
- `count_south` is `count_north - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N') or `count_north`
- `count_east` and `count_west` satisfy the condition where:
  - `count_east` equals `count_west`
- `result` is a list containing either 'H', 'R', or a combination of these based on the value of `s[2]`
- `i` is 3
- `s[3]` is either 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W'

After executing the line `result.append('R')`, the list `result` will contain 'R' added to its previous contents. The values of `n`, `s`, `count_north`, `count_south`, `count_east`, `count_west`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \), `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `count_north` and `count_south` satisfy the condition where `count_north` equals `count_south + 1` (if `s[2]` is 'S') or `count_south - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N'), `count_south` is `count_north - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N') or `count_north`, `count_east` and `count_west` satisfy the condition where `count_east` equals `count_west`, `result` is a list containing the element 'R' appended to its previous contents, `i` is 3**
