The code `pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since the initial state does not define `pp`, we assume it is initialized as an empty list before this line of code. After appending `'H'` to the list, the list `pp` now contains one element, which is `'H'`. The variable `h` remains unchanged with its initial value of 2.

Output State: **`h` is 2; `pp` is ['H']**
