Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`. If `ww % 2 == 1`, then `r` is incremented by 1, `pp` contains the elements of the original `pp` plus `'R'`, and `h` is not affected. Otherwise, `pp` contains the string `'H'` appended to its previous elements, and `h` is incremented by 1.**
