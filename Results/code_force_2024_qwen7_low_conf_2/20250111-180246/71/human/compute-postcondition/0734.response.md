Postcondition: ***`l` is a list with at least one more character, allowing the loop to proceed. If `rr[1]` is true, then `rr[1]` is decremented by 1, `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list with the additional element `'R'` appended. Otherwise, `hh[1]` is decremented by 1 if it is greater than 0, otherwise `h` is incremented by 1. `pp` is set to `['H']` if `hh[1]` is greater than 0, otherwise it is set to `[R]`. `r` is either `rr[0] + 1` if `r < h`, or `h` is incremented by 1 if `r >= h`. `hh[0]` is incremented by 1 if `r >= h`. The loop can execute one more time if there is at least one more character in the list `l` and the conditions for the current character `i` allow the loop to proceed.***
