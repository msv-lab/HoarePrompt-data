`nn` is decremented by 1. The value of `l` remains unchanged, `i` remains the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`. The condition for `pp` and `r` or `h` does not change since the decrement operation does not affect the logic of `nn % 2 == 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee`, `nn - 1`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`. If `nn - 1 % 2 == 1`, then `pp` contains all its previous elements plus the string `'R'`, and `r` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `h` is equal to its previous value plus 1, and `pp` contains an additional element `'H'`.**
