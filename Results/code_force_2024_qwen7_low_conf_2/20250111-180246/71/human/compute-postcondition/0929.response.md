The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. However, there is no initial value given for `h`. Since `h` is not mentioned in the initial state and the code does not provide an initial value for `h`, we assume `h` was initialized to 0 before this code snippet (a common default initialization).

Given the initial state and the code snippet:
- Initial State: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'S', and the condition `(ss % 2 == 1)` is false.

Since the condition `(ss % 2 == 1)` is false, `ss` must be even. However, the value of `ss` itself is not relevant to the updated value of `h`.

The code updates `h` by incrementing it by 1. So, `h` becomes `h + 1`. Since `h` was initially 0, it now becomes 1.

Therefore, the updated state of the variables is:
- `l` is a non-empty list (unchanged)
- `i` is 'S' (unchanged)
- `h` is now 1

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'S', `h` is 1**
