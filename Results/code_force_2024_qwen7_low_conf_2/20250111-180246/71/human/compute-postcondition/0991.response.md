`pp` is appended with the string `'R'`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is the original value of `r` plus 1, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list containing one more element `'R'` than before, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` are as per their initial states, and `hh` and `ee` and `nn` are lists and boolean variables respectively.**
