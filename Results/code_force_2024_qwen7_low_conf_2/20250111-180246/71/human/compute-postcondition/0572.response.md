Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` and `h` are `0` or `1` based on the condition `(ss % 2 == 1)`, `i` is 'S', `rr` and `hh` are lists `[0, 0, 0, 0]` or `[-1, 0, 0, 0]` based on the value of `r`, and `pp` is `['R']` or `['H']` based on the value of `r`. If `ss` is not `0`, `r` is `1` if `(ss % 2 == 1)` is true, otherwise `r` is `0`, `h` is `1` if `(ss % 2 == 1)` is false, otherwise `h` is `0`, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` if `(ss % 2 == 1)` is true, otherwise `rr` is `[-1, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is `['R']` if `(ss % 2 == 1)` is true, otherwise `pp` is `['H']`. If `ss` is `0`, `r` and `h` are `0`, `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, and `pp` is `['R']`.***
