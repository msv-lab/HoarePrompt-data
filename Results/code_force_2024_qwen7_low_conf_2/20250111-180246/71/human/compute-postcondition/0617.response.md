Postcondition: **`rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are updated based on the conditions of the if and else parts. If `r < h`, then `rr` becomes `[a, b, c, d + 2]` and `pp` becomes `['R']`. Otherwise, `hh[3]` is incremented by 1, and all other variables (`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`) are incremented by 1. The initial values of `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are restored.**
