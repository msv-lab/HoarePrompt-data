`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` and the contents of the list `l` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'N' and is not 'S', `r` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is not equal to 'N' and is not 'S', `r` is increased by 1**
