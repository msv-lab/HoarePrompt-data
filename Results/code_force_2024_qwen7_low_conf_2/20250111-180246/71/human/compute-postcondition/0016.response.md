Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'. If `char` is 'S', then `count_south` is set to 2. If `char` is 'E', then `count_east` is incremented by 1. If `char` is neither 'S' nor 'E', then `count_west` is incremented by 1. `count_north` remains unchanged.***
