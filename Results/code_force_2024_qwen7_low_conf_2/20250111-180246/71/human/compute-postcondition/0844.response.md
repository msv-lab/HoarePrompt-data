The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since the initial state mentions that the current value of `r` is less than `h`, and no specific value for `r` is given, the only thing that changes is the value of `r`. All other variables remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `ww` is False, `rr[3]` remains False, `rr[2]` is one more than its original value, and `r` is increased by 1.**
