Postcondition: **`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are as follows:
- If the next character `i` is 'S' and `ss` is true, then `ss` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1. The value of `pp` becomes `['h + 1', 'rr', 'hh', 'pp', 'H']`.
- If the next character `i` is 'S' and `ss` is false, then the values of `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` remain the same as the preconditions.**
