Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', and (not `nn`). If `rr[1]` is True, then `r` is 1 and `pp` is ['R']. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is ['H'], or if `r` is less than `h`, then `r` is increased by 1, `rr[0]` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['R']. If `r` is greater than or equal to `h + 1`, then `hh[0]` is increased by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].***
