The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since the initial state of `r` is determined by `ww % 2 == 1`, the value of `r` changes accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` is a list with its fourth element decreased by 1, `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`, `hh` and `ee` and `nn` and `rr` and `hh` remain unchanged.**
