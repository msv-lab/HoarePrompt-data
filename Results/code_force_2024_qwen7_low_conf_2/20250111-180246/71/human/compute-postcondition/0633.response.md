In the initial state, `rr[0]` is a variable that holds a specific value. The code snippet `rr[0] += 1` increments the value of `rr[0]` by 1.

Let's denote the initial value of `rr[0]` as `initial_value`. After executing the code, the value of `rr[0]` will be `initial_value + 1`.

Output State: **`rr[0]` is `initial_value + 1`, and all other variables remain unchanged.**
