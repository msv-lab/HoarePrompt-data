`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `r` was originally less than `h`, so now it is `r + 1`, which is still less than `h`. The value at index 3 of `rr` remains unchanged, and the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is `r + 1` (less than `h`), and the value at index 3 of `rr` is unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `r` is `r + 1` (less than `h`), and the value at index 3 of `rr` is unchanged**
