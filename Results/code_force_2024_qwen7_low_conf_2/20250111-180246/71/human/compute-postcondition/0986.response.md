`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The initial value of `i` is the next element in the list `l`, and the value of `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`. The values of `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `pp` contains the value `'H'` added to its previous elements, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, `h` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `pp` contains the value `'H'` added to its previous elements, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, `h` is incremented by 1.**
