Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step.

### Given Program State:
- `_` is 1
- `t` must be greater than 1
- `m` is an integer input value
- `l` is a non-empty list
- `n` is 1 if `i` is 'N', and `n` is 0 otherwise
- `s` is 1 if `i` is 'S', and `s` is 0 otherwise
- `w` is 1 if `i` is 'W', and `w` is 0 otherwise
- `e` is 1 if `i` is 'E', and `e` is 0 otherwise

### For Loop:
```python
for i in l:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `l`.
- At the end of the previous iteration, we need to determine the state before the next iteration starts.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:

1. **List `l`:**
   - Since `l` is a non-empty list, it will continue to be a non-empty list until all elements are exhausted.
   - After the previous iteration, `l` still contains elements because it is a non-empty list.

2. **Variable `i`:**
   - In the previous iteration, `i` was set to the current element from the list `l`.
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be set to the next element in the list `l`.

3. **Other Variables (`_`, `t`, `m`, `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`):**
   - These variables are not modified within the loop based on the given information.
   - Therefore, they retain their values from the previous iteration.

### Conclusion:
For the loop to execute one more time, `l` should still be a non-empty list, and `i` should be set to the next element in the list.

### Final State:
State: **`_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` is a non-empty list, `n` is 1 if `i` is 'N', and `n` is 0 otherwise, `s` is 1 if `i` is 'S', and `s` is 0 otherwise, `w` is 1 if `i` is 'W', and `w` is 0 otherwise, `e` is 1 if `i` is 'E', and `e` is 0 otherwise, and `i` is the next element in the list `l`**.
