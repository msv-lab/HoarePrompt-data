`n` is incremented by 1. The original value of `n` is 0, so after executing `n += 1`, the new value of `n` is 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is 1, `s` is 0, `w` is 0, `e` is 0, `nn` is 0, `ss` is 0, `ww` is 0, `ee` is 0, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, the current value of `i` is 'N'**
