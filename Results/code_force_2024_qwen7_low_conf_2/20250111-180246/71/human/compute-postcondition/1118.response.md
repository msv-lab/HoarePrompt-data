Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`. If `rr[1]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['R'], and `rr[1]` is reduced by 1. Otherwise, depending on the condition `hh[1]`, `pp` either contains all its previous elements plus `'H'` and `h` is increased by 1, or `pp` contains its original elements plus either `'R'` or `'H'`. If `r < h`, then `hh[0]` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `hh[0]` is increased by 2, `h` is increased by 1, and `r` remains unchanged. Both `ee`, `nn`, and `rr` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.***
