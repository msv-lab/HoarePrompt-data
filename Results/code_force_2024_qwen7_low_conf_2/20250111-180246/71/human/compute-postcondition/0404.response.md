The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `n` is either `1` (if `i` is `'n'`), `1` (if `i` is `'s'`), `1` (if `i` is `'w'`), or `1` (if `i` is `'e'`). Since `n` was initially 1, it will now be 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is 2, `s`, `w`, and `e` are 1, and `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` remain 0.**
