Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`. If `r < h`, then `r` is incremented by 1, `pp` contains one additional element `'R'`, and `rr[1]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `pp` is the original list plus `'H'`, `hh[1]` is increased by 1, and `h` is incremented by 1.***
