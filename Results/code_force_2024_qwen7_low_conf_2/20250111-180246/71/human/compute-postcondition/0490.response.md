`pp` is an empty list `[]`, and the code appends the string `'H'` to `pp`. Therefore, `pp` becomes `['H']`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `0`, `h` is `1`, the current character being processed is not 'E', `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` with the third element being `0`, `pp` is `['H']`.**
