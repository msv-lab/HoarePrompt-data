`pp` is appended with the value 'H', which means `pp` now contains the element 'H'. The initial values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is some other string, `rr` is [False], `h` is incremented by 1, `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, and the second element of `hh` is incremented by 1; `pp` is ['H'].
