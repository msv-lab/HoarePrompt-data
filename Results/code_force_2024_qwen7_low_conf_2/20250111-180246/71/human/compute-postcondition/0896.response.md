`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The value of `l`, `i`, `nn`, and `h` remains unchanged from their initial states. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `nn` is false, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `nn` is false, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list containing `'H'`**
