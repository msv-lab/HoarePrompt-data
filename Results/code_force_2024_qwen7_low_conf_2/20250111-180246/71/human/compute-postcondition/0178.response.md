`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `r` was less than `h`, so after incrementing, `r` is still less than `h`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W', and `i` is not equal to 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, `(rr[0])` is false, `(hh[0])` is false, `r` is less than `h` plus one, and `rr[1]` is True.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W', and `i` is not equal to 'E', the condition `(ss)` is false, `(rr[0])` is false, `(hh[0])` is false, `r` is less than `h` + 1, and `rr[1]` is True**
