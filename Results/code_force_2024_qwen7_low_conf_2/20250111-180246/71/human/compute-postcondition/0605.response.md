The code snippet `rr[2] -= 1` decrements the value of the third element in the list `rr` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact values of the variables, we will assume that the list `rr` is defined and has at least three elements. 

Given the initial state:
- `rr` is a list with at least three elements.

After executing the code snippet:
- The value of `rr[2]` is decremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`rr` is a list where the third element (`rr[2]`) is decremented by 1.**
