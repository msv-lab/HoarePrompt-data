`e` is incremented by 1. The value of `e` was 2 if `i` was 'E', so now `e` is 3 if `i` is 'E'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`, `e` is 3 if `i` is 'E', `n` is 2 if `i` is 'N', `s` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'S', `w` is 2 if `i` is 'W', and all other variables retain their previous values or are reset accordingly.**
