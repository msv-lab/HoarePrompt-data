The code `rr[3] -= 1` subtracts 1 from the value of `rr[3]`. Given the initial state, `rr[3]` is `True`, which in Python is equivalent to `1`. Subtracting 1 from `1` results in `0`. The other variables (`l`, `i`, and `ww`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `l` remains a non-empty list.
- `i` remains `'W'`.
- `ww` remains `False`.
- `rr[3]` changes from `True` to `0`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'W', `ww` is False, and `rr[3]` is 0**
