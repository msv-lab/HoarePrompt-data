Postcondition: **`hh[3]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list with an additional element `'H'` if `hh[3]` is true. Otherwise, `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` retain their original values unless the following conditions are met:
- If `r < h`, then `rr[2]` is incremented by 1, and `pp` contains 'R'.
- If `r >= h`, then `hh[2]` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing 'H'.**
