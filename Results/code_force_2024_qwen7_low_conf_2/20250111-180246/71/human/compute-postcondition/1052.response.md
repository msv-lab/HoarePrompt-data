Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`, and `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are boolean variables and lists respectively. If `i == 'W'`:
- If `ww` is initially odd, `r` is `r-1`, `pp` contains the elements of the original `pp` plus `'H'`. If `ww` is initially even, `r` is `r+1`, `pp` contains the elements of the original `pp` plus `'R'`. If `ww` is initially odd and `rr[3]` is true, then `pp` is `[i, 'R']` and `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`. If `ww` is initially even and `rr[3]` is false, then `pp` remains unchanged and includes `'R'` if `r < h` and `hh[3]` is false, or updates to include `'H'` and `h` is incremented by 1 if `hh[3]` is true. `ee` and `nn` remain unchanged, `rr` is a list with its fourth element decreased by 1, and `hh` is a list with its third element possibly incremented by 1.
- If `i == 'E'`:
  - If `ee` is true, `pp` contains an additional element `'R'` if `ee % 2 == 1` or `'H'` otherwise, and `r` and `h` are updated based on the new value of `ee % 2`. If `ee` is false, if `rr[2]` is true, `r` is increased by 1 and `pp` contains an additional element `'R'`, and `hh`, `ee`, and `nn` remain unchanged. If `hh[2]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1. If `r < h`, then `r` is set to the initial value of `ww % 2 == 1` plus 1 and `pp` contains the string `'R'`. If `r >= h`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` contains the string `'H'`.
- If `i == 'N'`:
  - If `nn % 2 == 1` was True, then `pp` is `['R']`; otherwise, `pp` is `['H']`.
  - If `rr[1]` is true, then `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[1]` is decreased by 1, and the last element of `pp` is `'H'`.
  - If `r < h`, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1. If `r >= h`, the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and `pp` includes the string `'H'`.
- If `i == 'S'`:
  - If `ss` is true, `pp` may contain an additional element `'R'` or `'H'`, and `h` is incremented by 1 if the else part executed.
  - If `rr[0]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `hh` is a list where its first element is decremented by 1 and `hh[0]` is true, and `hh` and `rr` remain lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.
  - If `rr[0]` is false, `pp` may contain an additional element `'H'` if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise `pp` remains unchanged. `hh` is a list where its first element is decreased by 1 if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise the first element of `hh` is increased by 1. If `hh[0]` is true, `h` is incremented by 1 based on `ww % 2 == 1`. If `hh[0]` is false, if `r < h`, then `pp` has an additional element `'R'` and `rr[1]` is increased by 1, otherwise `hh[1]` is increased by 1 and `h` is set to `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`.**
