`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The value of `i` is the next element in the list `l`, but its specific value is not given. The value of `r` is incremented by 1, and `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`. The value of `ee` and `nn` are boolean variables, and `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively. The states of these variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is incremented by 1, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` contains the elements of the original `pp` plus `'R'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.**
