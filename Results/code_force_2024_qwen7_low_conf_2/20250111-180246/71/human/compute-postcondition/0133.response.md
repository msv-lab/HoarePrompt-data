`rr[1]` is decremented by 1. Initially, `rr[1]` is true, which in Python is equivalent to 1. So, after the operation, `rr[1]` becomes 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', and (not nn), and `rr[1]` is false.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W' and not equal to 'E', and (not nn), and `rr[1]` is false**
