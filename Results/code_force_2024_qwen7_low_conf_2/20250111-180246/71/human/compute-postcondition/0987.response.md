Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r` and `h`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `pp` is a list containing the elements of its original state plus either `'R'` (if `ee % 2 == 1`) or `'H'` (otherwise), `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, and `r` is incremented by 1 if `ee % 2 == 1`, otherwise `h` is incremented by 1.**
