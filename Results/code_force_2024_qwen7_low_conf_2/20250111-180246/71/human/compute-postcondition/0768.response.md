Postcondition: ***`n`, `s`, `w`, `e` are the counts of 'N', 'S', 'W', and 'E' in the string `l`; `nn` and `ss` are the final values derived from the comparison between `n` and `s`; `ww` is either `w - e` or `0` depending on the condition `w > e`, and `ee` is either `0` or `e - w` depending on the same condition; `m` remains unchanged; `l` is the input string; `r` and `h` are the final counts of 'R' and 'H' derived from the loop; `rr` and `hh` are updated lists based on the conditions during the loop; `pp` is the final list containing the sequence of 'R' and 'H'; if both `r` and `h` are True and at least one of `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, or `ee` is odd, the function prints `pp`; otherwise, the function prints 'NO'.***
