`n` is incremented by 1. The value of `n` was 2 if `i` was 'N', so now it will be 3. All other variables retain their previous values or are reset accordingly. Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is 3 if `i` is 'N', `s` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'S', `w` is 2 if `i` is 'W', `e` is 2 if `i` is 'E', and all other variables retain their previous values or are reset accordingly.
