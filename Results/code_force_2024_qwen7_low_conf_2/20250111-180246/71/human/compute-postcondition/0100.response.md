The code snippet `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. The initial state indicates that `r` is not explicitly defined, so it is assumed to be 0 (as it is not mentioned otherwise). Therefore, after executing `r += 1`, the value of `r` becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`l`, `i`, and `rr`) are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `rr[2]` is False, `r` is 1**
