Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable. If `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1, the second element of `hh` is decreased by 1, and the last element of `pp` is `'H'`. Otherwise, if `r < h`, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1. If `r >= h`, the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and `pp` includes the string `'H'`.***
