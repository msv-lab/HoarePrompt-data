The code snippet `rr[1] += 1` increments the second element of the list `rr` by 1. The initial state of the variables is not explicitly provided, but we know that `rr` is a list and initially contains certain values.

Let's assume the initial state of `rr` is `[a, b, c, ...]`. After executing the code snippet, the second element of `rr` (which is `b`) is incremented by 1. Thus, the new value of `b` will be `b + 1`.

Output State: **`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr` is `[a, b+1, c, ...]`, `pp`**
