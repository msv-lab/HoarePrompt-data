In the given state, `h` is currently 1. The code snippet `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Therefore, the new value of `h` will be `1 + 1`, which is `2`.

The other variables remain unchanged. 

Thus, the updated state is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww` is 3.
- `r` is 1.
- `h` is 2.
- `rr` is [0, False, 1, False].
- `hh` is [False, False, 0, False].
- `ee` is 0.
- `nn` is 2.
- `ss` is False.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**.
