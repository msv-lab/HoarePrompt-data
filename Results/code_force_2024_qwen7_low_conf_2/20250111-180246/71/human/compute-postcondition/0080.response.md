The code `result.append('H')` appends the string 'H' to the list `result`. Since the initial state does not provide any information about `result`, we assume it is an empty list before this operation.

After executing `result.append('H')`, the list `result` will contain the element 'H'.

Output State: **`result` is ['H']**
