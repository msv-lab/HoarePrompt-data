The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), and `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`.

- **Case_1**: The function returns 'NO'.
- **Case_2**: The function returns a string composed of 'H', 'R', or both, based on the values of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' in the string `s`, ensuring that the counts of 'N' and 'S' are balanced and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are balanced.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `s`, and return either 'NO' or a string composed of 'H', 'R', or both, depending on whether the counts of 'N' and 'S' are balanced and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are balanced.
