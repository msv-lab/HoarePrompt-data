`r` is incremented by 1, but the original value of `r` is not explicitly defined in the initial state. However, since `rr` is given as `[a, b, c, d + 1]`, we assume `r` is one of these elements. For the sake of this example, let's assume `r` is the last element of `rr`, which is `d + 1`. After executing `r += 1`, the value of `r` becomes `(d + 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `d + 2`.

Output State: **`rr` is `[a, b, c, d + 2]`**
