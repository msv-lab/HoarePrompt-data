Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively. If `i == 'N'` is true, then:
- If `nn % 2 == 1` was True, then `pp` is `['R']`; otherwise, `pp` is `['H']`.
- If `rr[1]` is true, then `r` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, if `hh[1]` is true, then `h` is incremented by 1, `hh[1]` is decreased by 1, and the last element of `pp` is `'H'`.
- If `r < h`, the first element of `rr` is increased by 1. If `r >= h`, the first element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and `pp` includes the string `'H'`.

If `i == 'N'` is false (i.e., `i == 'S'` is true), then:
- If `ss` is true, `pp` may contain an additional element `'R'` or `'H'`, and `h` is incremented by 1 if the else part executed.
- If `rr[0]` is true, `r` is increased by 1, `hh` is a list where its first element is decremented by 1 and `hh[0]` is true, and `hh` and `rr` remain lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.
- If `rr[0]` is false, `pp` may contain an additional element `'H'` if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise `pp` remains unchanged. `hh` is a list where its first element is decreased by 1 if `hh[0]` is true, otherwise the first element of `hh` is increased by 1. If `hh[0]` is true, `h` is incremented by 1 based on `ww % 2 == 1`. If `hh[0]` is false, if `r < h`, then `pp` has an additional element `'R'` and `rr[1]` is increased by 1, otherwise `hh[1]` is increased by 1 and `h` is set to `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`.***
