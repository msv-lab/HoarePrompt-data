Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E'. If `ee` is 0, then `r` is 1 and `pp` is ['R'], `h` is 1 and `pp` is ['H']. Otherwise, if `rr[2]` is False, `r` is 1 and `pp` is ['R']. If `hh[2]` is non-zero, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. If `hh[2]` is zero and `r < h`, then `r` is incremented by 1, and `hh[3]` remains unchanged. If `r` is not less than `h`, then `hh[3]` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].***
