Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list. If `rr[3]` is true, then `pp` is `[i, 'R']`. If `rr[3]` is false, then `pp` is either unchanged and includes `'R'` if `r < h` and `hh[3]` is false, or updated to include `'H'` and `h` is incremented by 1 if `hh[3]` is true. `ee` and `nn` remain unchanged, `rr` is a list with its fourth element decreased by 1, `r` is `ww % 2 + 1`, and `hh` is a list with its third element possibly incremented by 1.**
