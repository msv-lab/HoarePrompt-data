The code `rr[3] -= 1` subtracts 1 from the fourth element of the list `rr`. Since no initial values were provided for the variables, we will denote the fourth element of `rr` as `rr[3]` and assume it is some value `x` initially. After executing the code, `rr[3]` will be `x - 1`.

Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`rr[3]` is `rr[3] - 1`**
