Postcondition: ***`s[i]` is a character in the string `s`. `result` is a list where the state depends on the value of `s[i]`: if `s[i]` is 'N', the last element of `result` is changed to 'R' and `count_north` is decreased by 1; if `s[i]` is not 'N' and is 'E', `result` is set to ['R']; otherwise, `result` is set to ['H']. Both `i` and `count_east` are incremented by 1, and `count_west` remains unchanged.***
