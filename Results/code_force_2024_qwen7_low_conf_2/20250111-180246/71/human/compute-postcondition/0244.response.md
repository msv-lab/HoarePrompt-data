The value of `r` is incremented by 1. Initially, `r` is 1, so after executing `r += 1`, the value of `r` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
