Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-2`, and the counts (`count_north`, `count_east`, `count_west`, `count_south`) are updated based on the character `char`. If `char` is 'N', `count_north` is incremented by 1. If `char` is 'S', `count_south` is incremented by 1. If `char` is 'E', `count_east` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count_west` is incremented by 1.***
