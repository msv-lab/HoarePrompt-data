Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty string, `n` is the count of `'N'` in `l`, `s` is the count of `'S'` in `l`, `w` is the count of `'W'` in `l`, `e` is the count of any other character in `l`, `nn` is `|n - s|`, `ss` is `|s - n|`, `ww` is `w - e` if `w > e`, otherwise `0`, and `ee` is `0` if `w > e`, otherwise `e - w`. If at least one of the conditions `nn % 2 == 1`, `ss % 2 == 1`, `ww % 2 == 1`, or `ee % 2 == 1` holds, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, `ww` is the absolute difference between the count of 'W' and 'S' in `l`, `ee` is the absolute difference between the count of 'E' and 'N' in `l`, `nn` is the absolute difference between the count of 'N' and 'S' in `l`, `ss` is the absolute difference between the count of 'S' and 'N' in `l`. If both `ww` and `ee` are greater than 0, then `ww` and `ee` are decremented by 1 each, and 'R' and 'H' are appended to `pp`. If either `ww` or `ee` is 0, then `ww` or `ee` remains unchanged, and the sequence of 'R' and 'H' appended to `pp` remains as in `pp`. The output of the print statement is the string formed by concatenating all elements in `pp`.***
