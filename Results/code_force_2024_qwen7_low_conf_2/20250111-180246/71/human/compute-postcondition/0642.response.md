Postcondition: **`nn`, `r`, `pp`, `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `hh`, `rr`, `hh` are as follows:
- If `nn` is non-empty (`['H']`), then:
  - `r` remains unchanged.
  - `pp` remains unchanged.
  - `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `hh`, `rr`, `hh` remain as specified in the initial state.
- If `nn` is empty, then:
  - `rr[1]` is decremented by 1.
  - `r` is incremented by 1.
  - If `hh[1]` is `True`, then `hh[1]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing `'H'`.
  - Otherwise, either `rr[0]` is `initial_value + 1` or `hh[0]` is `val + 1`, `r` is `initial_value + 2` or `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is a list containing either `'R'` or `'H'`.**
