`s` is incremented by 1 if `i` is 'S'. The code simply increments `s` by 1. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the updated value of `s` depends on whether `i` was 'S' initially.

If `i` was 'S', then `s` is now `s + 1`. If `i` was not 'S', then `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string with one less character, `i` is the next character in `l`, `n` is 2 if `i` is 'N', `s` is `s + 1` if `i` is 'S', `w` is 2 if `i` is 'W', `e` is 2 if `i` is 'E', and all other variables retain their previous values or are reset accordingly.**
