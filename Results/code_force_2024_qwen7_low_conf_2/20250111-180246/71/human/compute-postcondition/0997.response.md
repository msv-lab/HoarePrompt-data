`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The value of `l`, `i`, `r`, `ee`, `nn`, `hh`, and `rr` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is the initial value of `ww % 2 == 1` plus 1, `pp` contains the value `'R'`, `h` is in its initial state, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` is a list of integers where the value at index 3 is incremented by 1, and `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is the initial value of `ww % 2 == 1` plus 1, `pp` contains the value `'R'`, `h` is in its initial state, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` is a list of integers where the value at index 3 is incremented by 1, and `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers.**
