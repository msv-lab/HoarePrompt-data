`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The value of `hh[2]` is `hh[2] - 1`, and the value of `h` is `h + 1`. After executing the code, `pp` contains the string `'H'`, and the values of `hh[2]` and `h` have been updated accordingly.

Output State: **`hh[2]` is `hh[2] - 1`, `h` is `h + 1`, `pp` is `[ 'H' ]`**
