Postcondition: ***`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is a string other than 'N' and 'S'. `rr` starts as [False]. If `r < h`, then `rr[1]` is incremented by 1, `pp` is a list with an additional element `'R'`, and the value of `r` is less than `h` + 1. Otherwise, `h` is incremented by 1, the second element of `hh` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].***
