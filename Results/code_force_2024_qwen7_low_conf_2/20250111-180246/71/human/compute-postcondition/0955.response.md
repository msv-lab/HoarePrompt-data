Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is a string other than 'N'. `r` is increased by 1, and `pp` is a list containing either all its original elements plus the new element 'R' (if `ss` is even), or the element 'R' (if the first element of `rr` is True), or the element 'H' (if the first element of `hh` is 1). Additionally, if `r < h` and the first element of `rr` is not True, `pp` includes the additional element 'R'. If `r >= h` and the first element of `hh` is not 1, `h` is incremented by 1.**
