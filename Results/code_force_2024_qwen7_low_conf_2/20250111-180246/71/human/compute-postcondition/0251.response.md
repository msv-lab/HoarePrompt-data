The code `pp.append('R')` appends the string `'R'` to the list `pp`. Initially, `pp` is not mentioned in the state, so we assume it is an empty list before this operation.

After the operation, `pp` will contain the element `'R'`.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [1, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is ['R']**
