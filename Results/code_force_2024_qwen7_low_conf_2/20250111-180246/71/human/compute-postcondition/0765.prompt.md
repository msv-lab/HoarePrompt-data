You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for finding the postcondition of an else statement based on the condition of the if statement. You will be given the precondition, the if condition and you need to calculate the postcondition to take into account that the program does not enter the if block and goes to the lese block instead. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before entering the if condition.
If condition: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This is the condition to enter the if statement. WE DO NOT FOLLOW THE IF CONDITION IN THIS CASE. WE ENTER THE ELSE BLOCK.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after not entering the if block and instead enetering the else block . So taking into account the precondition it must be extended so the if condition is false. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. 
I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
If condition:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, and the lenght of the `str` is more than or equal to 3***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
if condition:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
```

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***`n` can have any value except an integer one`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
if condition:
```
if x < 2:
```


Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive larger or equal to 2***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer, a is a list of integers
if condition:
```
if n <=0:
```


Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. n is larger than 0, a is a list of integers***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, a is a list of integers.
if condition:
```
if a[0] != 0:
```

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer , a is a list of integers. The first element of a is 0***

Your Task:
Precondition: To determine the final state of the program after the for loop has executed, we need to consider the effects of each iteration of the loop. Let's analyze the loop step-by-step:

### Analysis of the Loop

1. **Initialization**:
   - `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`: These represent counts of 'N', 'S', 'W', and 'E' in the string `l`.
   - `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`: These are updated based on comparisons and operations involving `n`, `s`, `w`, and `e`.
   - `m`: An input integer.
   - `l`: A non-empty input string.
   - `r`, `h`: Counters initialized to 0.
   - `rr`, `hh`: Lists initialized to `[0, 0, 0, 0]`.
   - `pp`: An empty list `[]`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - For each character `i` in `l`:
     - Depending on the character, specific logic updates `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, and `pp`.

### Step-by-Step Determination of Final State

#### Case Analysis for Each Character

1. **Character 'W'**:
   - `ww` is either `w - e - 1` or `0` depending on the condition `w > e`.
   - `ee` is either `0` or `e - w` depending on the condition `w > e`.
   - If `ww % 2 == 1`, then `r` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
   - If `ww % 2 == 0`, then `h` is incremented by 1 and `pp` is set to `['H']`.
   - If `ww` is false, then specific conditions update `r`, `h`, `rr`, and `hh`.

2. **Character 'E'**:
   - `ee` is either `e - 1` or `e - w` depending on the condition `w > e`.
   - If `ee % 2 == 0`, specific conditions update `r`, `h`, `rr`, and `hh`.
   - If `ee % 2 != 0`, similar conditions apply to `r` and `h`.

3. **Character 'N'**:
   - `nn` is decremented by 1 and its parity is considered.
   - Based on the parity of `nn`, `r` and `h` are updated, and `rr` and `hh` are updated accordingly.

4. **Character 'S'**:
   - `ss` is decremented by 1 and its parity is considered.
   - Based on the parity of `ss`, `r` and `h` are updated, and `rr` and `hh` are updated accordingly.

### Final State After All Iterations

After all characters in `l` are processed, the following should hold true:

- **`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`**: These will be the counts of 'N', 'S', 'W', and 'E' in the string `l` after processing all characters.
- **`nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`**: These will be the final values derived from the operations during the loop execution.
- **`m`**: Remains unchanged.
- **`l`**: The input string `l`.
- **`r`, `h`**: Final counts of 'R' and 'H' derived from the loop execution.
- **`rr`, `hh`**: Updated lists based on the conditions during the loop.
- **`pp`**: Final list containing the sequence of 'R' and 'H'.

### Output State

Given the above analysis, the final output state of the program after the for loop has executed all iterations is:

**Output State: `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp` are such that:
- `n`, `s`, `w`, `e` are the counts of 'N', 'S', 'W', and 'E' in the string `l`.
- `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee` are the final values derived from the operations during the loop.
- `m` remains unchanged.
- `l` is the input string.
- `r`, `h` are the final counts of 'R' and 'H' derived from the loop.
- `rr` and `hh` are updated lists based on the conditions during the loop.
- `pp` is the final list containing the sequence of 'R' and 'H'**.

This ensures that all variables reflect their final values after the loop has completed its execution.
if condition:
```
if (r and h):
```
Your task is to complete the  postcondition .All the information of the precondition must be included in the postcondition and additionally the negation of the if condition must also be included. Give the overall state of the program for the program after it does not enter the if condition and instead enters the else.
