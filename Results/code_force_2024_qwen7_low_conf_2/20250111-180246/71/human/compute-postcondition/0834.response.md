The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was not initially defined in the given initial state, it is assumed to be 0 before this operation. After executing the code, `r` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'W', `ww` is False, `r` is 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'W', `ww` is False, `r` is 1**
