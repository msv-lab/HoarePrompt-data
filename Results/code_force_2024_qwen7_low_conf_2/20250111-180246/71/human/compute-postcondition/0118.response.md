Postcondition: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E'. If `rr[2]` is False, then `r` is 1 and `pp` is ['R']. Otherwise, if `hh[2]` is a non-zero value, then `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], and `hh[2]` is decreased by 1. If `hh[2]` is zero and `r < h`, then `r` is incremented by 1, and `hh[3]` remains unchanged. If `r` is not less than `h`, then `hh[3]` is incremented by 1, `h` is increased by 1, and `pp` is ['H'].**
