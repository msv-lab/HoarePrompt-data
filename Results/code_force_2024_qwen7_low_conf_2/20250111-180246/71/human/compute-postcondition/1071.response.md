The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. This operation does not affect the other variables mentioned in the initial state.

Therefore, the output state is: `l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `hh[2]` is increased by 1, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, and `pp` is a list containing one additional element `'H'` compared to its initial state; `h` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `hh[2]` is increased by 1, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is a list with an additional element `'H'`, and `h` is increased by 1.**
