`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The value of `l` is reduced by one element, and the value of `i` is the next element in the list after the reduction. The value of `h` is equal to its previous value plus 1. The initial state of `r`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` is still valid as no changes are made to these variables.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list with one element less than before, `i` is the next element in the list, `h` is equal to its previous value plus 1, `pp` contains an additional element `'H'`, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.**
