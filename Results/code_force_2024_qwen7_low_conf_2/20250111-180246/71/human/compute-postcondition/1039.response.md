`rr[1]` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the next element in the list `l`, but since the code does not affect `i`, `l`, `ww`, `r`, `pp`, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh`, these variables remain unchanged. The only change is to `rr[1]`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr[1]` is increased by 1, and `hh` is a list containing boolean values and integers respectively.**
