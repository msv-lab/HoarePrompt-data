The code `count_south -= 1` decrements the value of `count_south` by 1. Since `count_south` was previously equal to `count_north` (which is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\)), the new value of `count_south` will be `count_north - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5\), `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`, `count_north` equals `count_south` + 1, `count_south` is `count_north - 1`, `count_east` equals `count_west`, `result` is a list containing 'H', `i` is 0, and the current value of `s[i]` is 'S'**
