`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. The value of `i` is the next element in the list `l`, but since no changes are made to `i`, its value remains unchanged. The condition `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, which does not affect the current execution of appending `'R'` to `pp`. The values of `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` contains one more element `'R'`, `h` is determined by the same condition, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is `['R']`, `h` is determined by the same condition, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.**
