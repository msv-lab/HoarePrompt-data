The code snippet `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since the exact initial value of `h` is not specified in the initial state, we will denote the new value of `h` as `h + 1`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the updated value of `h`.

Output State: **`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h` is `h + 1`, `rr`, `hh`, `pp`**
