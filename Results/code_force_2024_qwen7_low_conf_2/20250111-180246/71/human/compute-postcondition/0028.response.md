`count_south` is incremented by 1. The length of `s` remains `n-2`, and the values of `count_north`, `count_east`, and `count_west` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-2`, `count_north` is unchanged, `count_east` is unchanged, `count_west` is unchanged, and `count_south` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `s` is a string of length `n-2`, `count_north` is unchanged, `count_east` is unchanged, `count_west` is unchanged, `count_south` is incremented by 1**
