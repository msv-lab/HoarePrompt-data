`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The value of `l` remains a non-empty list, `i` remains 'E', and `h` is increased by 1. The condition `(ee)` remains false. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is a list with one element `'H'`, and the condition `(ee)` is still false.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'E', `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H'], and the condition `(ee)` is still false.**
