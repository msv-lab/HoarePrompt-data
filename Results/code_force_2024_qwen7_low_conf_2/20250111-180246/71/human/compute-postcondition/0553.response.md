The code appends the string 'R' to the list `pp`. However, the initial state does not provide any information about the list `pp`. Since no initial value for `pp` is given, we assume `pp` is an empty list before the code is executed. After executing `pp.append('R')`, the list `pp` will contain the element 'R'.

The other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `1`, `h` is `0`, `i` is 'S', `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` and `rr[0]` is `0`, `ss` is `0`, and `pp` is a list containing one element 'R'.

Output State: **`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `1`, `h` is `0`, `i` is 'S', `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]` and `rr[0]` is `0`, `ss` is `0`, `pp` is ['R']**
