`h` is incremented by 1. The possible initial values of `h` are 1 or 2, so incrementing `h` by 1 will make it either 2 or 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1 or 2, `h` is 2 or 3, `rr` is one of [0, False, 1, False], [1, False, 1, False], or [-1, False, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, True, 0, False], [1, True, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is one of ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H'] based on the values of `r` and `h`, `hh[1]` is True, `i` is 'E'**
