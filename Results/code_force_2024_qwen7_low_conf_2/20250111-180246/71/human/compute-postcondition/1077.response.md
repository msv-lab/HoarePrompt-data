`pp` is appended with the value `'R'`. This operation does not affect the values of `l`, `i`, `ww`, `r`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, `hh`, and their conditions. Therefore, the output state includes the updated list `pp` and retains the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list (one element less than before), `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp` is ['R'], and `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` are adjusted according to the rules specified for `i`.**
