`s` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `s` was 0, so now `s` is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` must be a non-empty list, `n` is 0, `s` is 1, `w` is 0, `e` is 0, `i` is 'S'.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` must be a non-empty list, `n` is 0, `s` is 1, `w` is 0, `e` is 0, `i` is 'S'**
