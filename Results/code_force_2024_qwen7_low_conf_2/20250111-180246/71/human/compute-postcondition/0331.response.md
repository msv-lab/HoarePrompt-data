`pp` is a list that appends the value `'R'`. Based on the initial state, `pp` could be one of ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H'] depending on the values of `r` and `h`. After appending `'R'`, the list `pp` will include `'R'` again. Therefore, the updated list `pp` will be one of ['R', 'R'], ['H', 'R'], or ['R', 'H', 'R']. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2 or 3, `h` is 1 or 2, `rr` is one of [0, False, 1, False], [1, False, 1, False], or [-1, False, 1, False], `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False], `ee` is 0 or -1, `nn` is 1 or 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is one of ['R', 'R'], ['H', 'R'], or ['R', 'H', 'R'], and `i` is 'E'.**
