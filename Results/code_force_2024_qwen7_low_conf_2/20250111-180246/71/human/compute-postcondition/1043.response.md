The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Since the initial state does not specify the exact value of `h`, we only know that it was initially `ww % 2 == 1`. After executing the code, `h` will be `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively; `hh[1]` is increased by 1, `h` is `ww % 2 == 1 + 1`.**
