`r` is incremented by 1. Since `r` can be either 1 or 2, adding 1 to it will result in `r` being 2. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN"; `ww` is 3; `r` is 2; `h` is 1 or 2; `rr` is one of `[0, False, 0, False]`, `[1, False, 0, False]`, or `[-1, False, 0, False]`; `hh` is one of [False, False, 0, False], [1, False, 0, False], or [False, True, 0, False]; `ee` is 0 or -1; `nn` is 1 or 2; `ss` is False; `pp` is one of ['R'], ['H'], or ['R', 'H'] based on the values of `r` and `h`; `i` is 'E'; `rr[2]` is 0.**
