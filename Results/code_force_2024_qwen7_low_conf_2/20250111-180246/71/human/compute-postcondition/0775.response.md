`n` is incremented by 1. The original value of `n` was 0, so now `n` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`_` is 1, `t` must be greater than 1, `m` is an integer input value, `l` must be a non-empty list, `n` is 1, `s` is 0, `w` is 0, `e` is 0, and `i` is equal to 'N'**
