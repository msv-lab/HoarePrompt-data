`hh[1]` is incremented by 1. The value of `hh[0]` remains unchanged because no operation affects it, and the condition `(ss)` is still false. The conditions `(rr[0])` and `(hh[0])` also remain unchanged. The value of `r` and `h` are such that `r` is greater than or equal to `h`, but their exact values are not specified and do not affect the updated value of `hh[1]`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is equal to 'S', and `i` is not equal to 'N', and `i` is not equal to 'W', and `i` is not equal to 'E', and the condition `(ss)` is false, and `(rr[0])` is false, and `(hh[0])` is false, and `hh[1]` is increased by 1, and `r` is greater than or equal to `h`.**
