Postcondition: **`ee` is even, `r` is unchanged, `n` is either 3 or 5, `m` is either 4 or 6, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is `['H']`. If `ee` is not true, then one of the following cases holds:
- If `rr[2] > 0`, then `rr[2]` is decremented by 1, `r` is incremented by 1, and `pp` remains a list containing at least one element, which is `'R'`.
- If `hh[2]` is true, then `hh[2]` is decremented by 1, `h` is incremented by 1, and `pp` is set to `['H']`.
- If neither condition holds, then `hh[2]` is false, `r < h`, and `rr` is updated to `[a, b, c, d + 2]`, and `pp` is set to `['R']`.
- If all previous conditions fail, then `hh[3]` is incremented by 1, and all other variables (`n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`) are incremented by 1, and the initial values of `rr`, `hh`, and `pp` are restored.**
