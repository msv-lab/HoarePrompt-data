The code `h += 1` increments the value of `h` by 1. Given the initial state where `h` is 1, the new value of `h` will be 2. No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [-1, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
