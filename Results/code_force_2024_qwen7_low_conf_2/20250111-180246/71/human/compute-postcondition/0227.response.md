The code `rr[3] += 1` increments the value at index 3 of the list `rr` by 1. Given the previous state of the variables:

- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`

The value at index 3 of `rr` is currently `False`. After incrementing this value by 1, `False` is converted to `0`, and then `0 + 1` results in `1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, 1], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
