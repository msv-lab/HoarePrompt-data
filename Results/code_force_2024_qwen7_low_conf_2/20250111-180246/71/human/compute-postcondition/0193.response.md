Initial State: `l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False

The code snippet is:
```python
r += 1
```

Step-by-step analysis:
- The variable `r` is incremented by 1.
- The initial value of `r` is 1.
- After incrementing, the new value of `r` is 1 + 1 = 2.

No other variables are affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**
