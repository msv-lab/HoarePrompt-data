`pp` is appended with the value `'H'`. The initial state does not mention `pp`, so it is assumed to be a new list being created. The initial values of `i` and `h` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'S', `h` is 1, and `pp` is a list containing one element `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'S', `h` is 1, `pp` is ['H']**
