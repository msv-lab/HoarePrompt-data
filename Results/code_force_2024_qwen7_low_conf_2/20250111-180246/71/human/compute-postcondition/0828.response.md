`pp.append('H')` adds the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. The initial state tells us that `l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `(ww % 2 == 1)` is false, and `h` is incremented by 1. However, since the code does not affect `l`, `i`, `ww`, or `h`, their states remain unchanged. The only change is that the list `pp` now contains the element `'H'`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `(ww % 2 == 1)` is false, `h` is incremented by 1, `pp` is a list containing the element `'H'`**
