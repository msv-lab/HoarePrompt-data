The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Given that the initial state includes `l` as a non-empty list, `i` as 'N', and `rr[1]` as 0, only the value of `r` is affected.

Since the initial value of `r` is not specified, we assume it was previously some integer value, say `r_val`. After executing `r += 1`, `r` will now be `r_val + 1`.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is 0, `r` is `r_val + 1`**
