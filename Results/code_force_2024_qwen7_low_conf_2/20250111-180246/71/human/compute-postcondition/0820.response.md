To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop and the initial states step by step.

### Analysis of the For Loop
The for loop iterates over each element `i` in the list `l`. The loop body is omitted, but we need to ensure that the loop can execute based on the provided initial states.

### Initial States
- `_` is 1
- `t` is greater than 1
- `m` is an integer
- `l` is a non-empty list
- `n` is the count of 'N' in `l`
- `s` is the count of 'S' in `l`
- `w` is the count of 'W' in `l`
- `e` is the count of 'E' in `l`
- `nn` is 0
- `ss` is 0
- `ww` is 0
- `ee` is 0
- `r` is 0
- `h` is 0
- `rr` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`
- `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`
- `pp` is an empty list `[]`

### Conditions for Loop Execution
For the loop `for i in l:` to execute, the list `l` must contain at least one element. This is because the loop will iterate through each element of `l`.

### States to Adjust
- Since `l` is specified as a non-empty list, it already meets the condition for the loop to execute.
- There is no other state that directly affects the loop's ability to execute based on the given information.

### Final State Adjustment
Based on the analysis, the only state that needs to be explicitly adjusted for the loop to execute is that `l` is a non-empty list.

### Answer
State: **`l` is a non-empty list**
