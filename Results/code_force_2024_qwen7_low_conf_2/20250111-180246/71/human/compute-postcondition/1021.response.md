The value of `h` is incremented by 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h` when `i == 'W'`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `hh` is a list where the first element is incremented by 1 and the rest of the elements remain unchanged, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively, `h` is increased by 1.**
