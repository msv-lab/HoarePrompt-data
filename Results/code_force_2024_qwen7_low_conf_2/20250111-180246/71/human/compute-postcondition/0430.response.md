Postcondition: ***`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is either `w - e` or `0` depending on the condition `w > e`, `ee` is either `0` or `e - w` depending on the condition `w > e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string. At least one of `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, or `ee` is odd.***
