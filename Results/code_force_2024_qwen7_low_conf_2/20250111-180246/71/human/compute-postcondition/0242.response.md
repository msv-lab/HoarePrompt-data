`nn` is decremented by 1. Since `nn` can be either 2 or any other value (if it was reduced to 1 in a previous operation), the new value of `nn` will be 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2 or 1, `h` is 1 or 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 1, `ss` is False, `pp` is either ['R'] or ['H'] depending on the value of `nn`.**
