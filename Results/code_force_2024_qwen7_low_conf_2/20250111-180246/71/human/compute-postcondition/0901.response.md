`rr[1]` is decremented by 1. The initial value of `rr[1]` is True, but since boolean values in Python are represented as integers (True as 1 and False as 0), this operation will change `rr[1]` from 1 to 0. The states of the other variables (`l`, `i`, and `rr[1]`) are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is 'N', `rr[1]` is 0**
