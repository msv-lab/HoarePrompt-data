Postcondition: **`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is `0`, `h` is `0`, `not (i == 'N')`, `rr` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `hh` is a list `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `pp` is an empty list `[]`.**
