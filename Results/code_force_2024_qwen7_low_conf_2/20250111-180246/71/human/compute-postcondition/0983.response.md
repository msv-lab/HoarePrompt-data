`r` is incremented by 1. The value of `i` is the next element in the list `l`, and its initial state of `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`. Since `i` is not specified as 'W', the values of `pp`, `h`, `ee`, `nn`, `rr`, and `hh` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` is the next element in the list, `r` is incremented by 1, `ww % 2 == 1` determines the initial state of `r`, `pp`, and `h`, `ee` is a boolean variable, `nn` is a boolean variable, `rr` and `hh` are lists containing boolean values and integers respectively.**
