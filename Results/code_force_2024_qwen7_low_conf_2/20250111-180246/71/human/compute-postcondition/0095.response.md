Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and a string `s` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`. It first counts the occurrences of each character ('N', 'S', 'E', 'W') in the string `s`. If the counts of 'N' and 'S' are not equal or the counts of 'E' and 'W' are not equal, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string consisting of 'H' and 'R' based on the values of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' in `s`, ensuring that the counts of 'N' and 'S' are balanced and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are balanced. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either 'NO' or a string composed of 'H' and 'R' depending on the balance of the counts of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W'.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` is outside the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), the function may not behave as expected due to the constraints imposed by the problem statement. However, the function itself does not check this condition, so it will proceed with the given `n` value.
- If the string `s` contains characters other than 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', the function will still attempt to process them, but it will not affect the final output since the counts of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' will be correctly calculated.
- If the string `s` is empty (`n = 0`), the function will return 'NO' because there are no characters to balance.
