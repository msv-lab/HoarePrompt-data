`r` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `r` is the previous value of `r` plus 1. Since `r` was initially 0, the new value of `r` is 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the count of 'N' in the string `l`, `s` is the count of 'S' in the string `l`, `w` is the count of 'W' in the string `l`, `e` is the count of 'E' in the string `l`, `nn` and `ss` are updated based on the comparison between `n` and `s`, `ww` is `0` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `ee` is `e - w` since `w` is not greater than `e`, `m` is an input integer, `l` is a non-empty input string, `r` is 1, `h` is `0`, the current value of `i` is 'S', `rr` is `[0, 1, 0, 0]`, `hh` is `[0, 0, 0, 0]`, `pp` is an empty list `[]`, the condition `(i == 'S')` is true, and the current value of `ss` is `0`.**
