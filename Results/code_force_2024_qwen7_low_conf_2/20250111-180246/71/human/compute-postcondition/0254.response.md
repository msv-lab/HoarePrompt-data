The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Initially, `pp` is not defined in the given state, so it will be created as an empty list and then the string `'H'` will be added to it.

Output State: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [1, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is ['H']**
