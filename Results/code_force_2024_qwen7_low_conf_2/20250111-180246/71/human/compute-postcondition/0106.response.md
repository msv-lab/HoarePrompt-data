The code `pp.append('H')` appends the string `'H'` to the list `pp`. Since `pp` was not initially defined in the given state, it is assumed to be a new empty list before this operation. After executing the line of code, `pp` will contain the single element `'H'`.

- The string `l` remains unchanged.
- The character `i` remains `'E'`.
- The value of `hh[2]` decreases by 1 but remains a non-zero value.
- The variable `h` is increased by 1 but its exact value is not specified, only that it has been incremented.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty string, `i` is 'E', `hh[2]` is a non-zero value decreased by 1, `h` is increased by 1, `pp` is ['H']**
