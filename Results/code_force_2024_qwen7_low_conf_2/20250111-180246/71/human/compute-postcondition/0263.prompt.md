You are assigned the role of a program verifier, responsible for completing the overall postcondition of Hoare triples for if statements based on the postconditions of the if and the else part. In addition to the Hoare triples, you will also see the postconditions for the if and else parts. Each Hoare triple is made up of three components: a precondition, a program fragment, and a postcondition. The precondition and the postcondition are expressed in natural language.

Precondition: describes the initial state of the program variables before the execution of the program fragment. This description should only include the values of the variables, without detailing the operational aspects of the program.

Program Fragment: This is a given part of the task and is not something you need to create or modify. This contains the condition of the if statement and if there is an else part there will also be an else: in the program fragment.

Postcondition: describes the state of the program variables after the execution of the program fragment with the initial state described in the precondition. This description should include both the values of the variables and the relationships between them. Similar to the precondition, avoid explaining how the program operates; concentrate solely on the variable values and their interrelations. Ensure that the postcondition retains the conditions stated in the precondition. You need to strictly follow the format and summarize the if statement in a coherent paragraph, rather than discussing it in separate paragraphs.

The if part : the postcondition of the if part

The else part : the postcondition of the else part

Combine the postconditions of the if and else part(if an else exists), taking into account the if condition,  to get the overall postcondition of the if else block

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**

Example 1:
Precondition: `str` is a string
Program Fragment:
```
if len(str) < 3:
```
If part: `str` is a string with lenght less than 3, the function returns None
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 1:
Postcondition: ***`str` is a string, if the length of `str` is less then 3, the function return None***


Example 2:
Precondition: `n` can have any value
Program Fragment:
```
if isinstance(n, int):
    
else:
    
```

If part: n is an integer of any value and the function returns `n`
Else part: n can have any value except an integer one and the function returns `int(n)`

Example Answer 2:
Postcondition: ***if `n` is integer, then the function returns `n` itself. Otherwise, the function return `int(n)`***

Example 3:
Precondition: `x` is an positive integer
Program Fragment:
```
if x < 2:
   
else:
    
```

If part: `x` is an positive integer less than 2, the function returns False
Else part: `x` is an positive integer larger or equal to 2 and the function returns True

Example Answer 3:
Postcondition: ***x is a positive integer, if x is less then 2, the function return False. Otherwise, the function return True***

Example 4:
Precondition: `m` is an integer, `n` is an integer
Program Fragment:
```
if n < 0:
    
else:
    
```
if part: the integer n was originally negative and `n` is updated to its negation. Integer `m` is increased by 1
else part: if n is 0 then return m , otherwise the integer `n` is decreased by 13. Integer `m` is increased by 1

Example Answer 4:
Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are integers. If n < 0, `m` is increased by 1 and `n` is negated. If n == 0, the function returns `m`. Otherwise, `n` is decreased by 13 and `m` is increased by 1.***

Example 5:
Precondition: `x` is an integer, y is zero.
Program Fragment:
```
if x > 0:
```
If part: `x` is a positive integer, if `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. Otherwise, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.
Else part: there is no else part in the code

Example Answer 5:
Postcondition: ***`x` is an integer. If `x` > 10, `y` is set to twice the value of `x`. If x is larger than 0 but lower than 10, `y` is set to the value of `x` plus 5.***

Your Task:
Precondition: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Initial Conditions**: The loop iterates over each character in the string `l`. The initial conditions given are:
   - `l` is a non-empty string.
   - Depending on the value of `i` (the current character being processed), different operations are performed on `l`, `ww`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, and `hh`.

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop processes each character in `l` sequentially. We need to determine the state of all relevant variables after the current character has been processed.

3. **Update Variables Based on Character**:
   - If `i` equals 'W':
     - `l` remains unchanged.
     - If `ww % 2 == 0`, `ww -= 1`.
     - If `ww % 2 == 0`, `r += 1`.
     - If `ww % 2 == 1`, `h += 1`.
   - If `i` does not equal 'W':
     - `l` remains unchanged.
     - If `i` equals 'E' and `ee == 0`, `r = 1`, `pp = ['R']`, `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`.
     - If `rr[2]` is False, `r = 1`, `pp = ['R']`.
     - If `hh[2]` is non-zero, `h += 1`, `pp = ['H']`, `hh[2] -= 1`.
     - If `hh[2]` is zero and `r < h`, `r += 1`, `hh[3]` remains unchanged.
     - If `r >= h`, `hh[3] += 1`, `h += 1`, `pp = ['H']`.
     - If `i` equals 'N' and `nn` is even, `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`, `r` remains unchanged.
     - If `i` equals 'N' and `nn` is odd, `h += 1`, `pp = ['H']`, `r += 1` if `r < h`, otherwise `r` remains unchanged.
     - If `i` equals 'S' and `ss` is true, `ss -= 1`, `r` remains unchanged, `h` remains unchanged, `pp = ['H']`.
     - If `i` equals 'S' and `ss` is false, based on the conditions of `rr` and `hh`, update `r`, `h`, and `pp` accordingly.

4. **Determine Next Iteration State**:
   - For the loop to continue, we need to ensure that the character `i` from the string `l` is processed and the resulting state of the variables is correct for the next iteration.

Given these steps, let's assume we are processing the first character of `l` and need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.

### Example Analysis

Let's assume the initial state before entering the loop is:
- `l` is "WEN", `ww = 4`, `r = 0`, `h = 0`, `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`, `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`, `ee = 0`, `nn = 2`, `ss = True`.

#### Processing the First Character ('W'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'W', `ww -= 1` (so `ww = 3`).
- Since `ww % 2 == 1`, `h += 1` (so `h = 1`).
- `r` remains unchanged (`r = 0`).

The state after processing the first character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 0`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = True`.

For the next iteration, the first character is now 'E'.

### Updated State for Next Iteration

#### Processing the Second Character ('E'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'E' and `ee == 0`, `r = 1`, `pp = ['R']`, `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`.

The state after processing the second character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 1`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = True`.

For the next iteration, the first character is now 'N'.

### Updated State for Next Iteration

#### Processing the Third Character ('N'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'N' and `nn` is even (`nn = 2`), `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`, `r` remains unchanged (`r = 1`).

The state after processing the third character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 1`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = True`.

For the next iteration, the first character is now 'S'.

### Updated State for Next Iteration

#### Processing the Fourth Character ('S'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'S' and `ss` is true (`ss = True`), `ss -= 1` (so `ss = False`), `r` remains unchanged (`r = 1`), `h` remains unchanged (`h = 1`), `pp = ['H']`.

The state after processing the fourth character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 1`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = False`.

For the next iteration, the first character is now 'E'.

### Updated State for Next Iteration

#### Processing the Fifth Character ('E'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'E' and `ee == 0`, `r = 1`, `pp = ['R']`, `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`.

The state after processing the fifth character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 1`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = False`.

For the next iteration, the first character is now 'N'.

### Final State for Next Iteration

#### Processing the Sixth Character ('N'):
- `l` remains "WEN".
- Since `i` is 'N' and `nn` is even (`nn = 2`), `h = 1`, `pp = ['H']`, `r` remains unchanged (`r = 1`).

The state after processing the sixth character is:
- `l` is "WEN".
- `ww = 3`.
- `r = 1`.
- `h = 1`.
- `rr = [0, False, 1, False]`.
- `hh = [False, False, 0, False]`.
- `ee = 0`.
- `nn = 2`.
- `ss = False`.

### Summary

State at the start of the next iteration: **`l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False**.
Program Fragment:
```
if ss % 2 == 1:
else:

```
if part: `l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 2, `h` is 1, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is ['R']
else part: `l` is "WEN", `ww` is 3, `r` is 1, `h` is 2, `rr` is [0, False, 1, False], `hh` is [False, False, 0, False], `ee` is 0, `nn` is 2, `ss` is False, `pp` is ['H']

Your task is to complete the overall postcondition of the whole if else block. Summarise all the cases and give the overall state of the program after the if else executes. Follow the format Postcondition: **the calculated postcondition**
