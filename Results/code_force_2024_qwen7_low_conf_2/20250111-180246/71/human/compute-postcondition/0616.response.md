`pp` is a list that appends the string 'H' to its end. The value of `hh[3]` is increased by 1, and other variables like `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h`, `rr`, `hh` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`hh[3]` is the original value of `hh[3]` + 1; `n`, `s`, `w`, `e`, `nn`, `ss`, `ww`, `ee`, `m`, `l`, `r`, `h` is increased by 1; `rr`, `hh` are as in the initial state; `pp` is a list containing the elements of the initial state plus 'H'.**
