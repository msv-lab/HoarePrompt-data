The code snippet `rr[1] -= 1` decrements the value of `rr[1]` by 1. Since no specific values were given for `rr`, we will assume `rr` is a list and that `rr[1]` exists and has some initial value.

Let's denote the initial value of `rr[1]` as `x`. After executing the code, `rr[1]` will be `x - 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged because they are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`rr[1]` is `rr[1] - 1`, and all other variables retain their initial states.**
