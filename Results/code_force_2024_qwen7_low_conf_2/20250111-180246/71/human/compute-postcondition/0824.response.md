The code `r += 1` increments the value of `r` by 1. Since `r` was not initially defined in the initial state, we assume it is initialized to 0 before this line of code is executed. The value of `r` is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`l` is a non-empty list, `i` equals 'W', `(ww)` is true, and `r` is 1**
