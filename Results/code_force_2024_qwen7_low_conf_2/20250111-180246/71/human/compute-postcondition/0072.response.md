`count_west` is decremented by 1. The value of `count_west` was previously equal to `count_east`, and the conditions involving `count_north` and `count_south` based on `s[2]` remain unchanged. The values of `n`, `s`, `result`, and `i` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 2 \times 10^5 \); `s` is a string consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`; `count_north` and `count_south` satisfy the condition where `count_north` equals `count_south + 1` (if `s[2]` is 'S') or `count_south - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N'); `count_south` is `count_north - 1` (if `s[2]` is 'N') or `count_north`; `count_east` and `count_west` satisfy the condition where `count_east` equals `count_west - 1`; `result` is a list containing either 'H', 'R', or a combination of these including 'H' based on the value of `s[2]`; `i` is 4; `count_west` is `count_east - 1`.**
