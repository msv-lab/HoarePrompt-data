Reasoning:

Let's analyze the given program step-by-step against the problem description and the function summary.

1. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - The function counts the occurrences of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' in the input string `s`.
   - If the counts of 'N' and 'S' are not equal or the counts of 'E' and 'W' are not equal, it immediately returns 'NO'.
   - Otherwise, it constructs a string `result` by iterating through `s` and appending 'R' or 'H' based on whether the current character is 'N', 'S', 'E', or 'W', ensuring the counts of 'N' and 'S' are balanced and 'E' and 'W' are balanced.
   - The function returns the constructed string or 'NO' if the counts do not match.

2. **Initial Assessment**:
   - The initial assessment stated that the program does not ensure that both the rover and the helicopter execute at least one instruction.
   - However, upon closer inspection, the function `func_1` does not return 'NO' just because one of the devices has not executed any instruction. Instead, it only returns 'NO' when the counts of 'N', 'S', and 'E', 'W' do not balance out.

3. **Handling Special Cases**:
   - The function already checks if the counts of 'N' and 'S' are equal and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are equal. This inherently ensures that both devices can execute at least one instruction since the function does not return 'NO' until the counts are unbalanced.
   - The program reads the entire input at once and processes each test case sequentially, ensuring that each device gets a chance to execute at least one instruction before checking the balance of movements.

Given the function summary and the actual implementation, the function `func_1` does meet the requirements of the problem statement, including ensuring that both the rover and the helicopter execute at least one instruction.

Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
