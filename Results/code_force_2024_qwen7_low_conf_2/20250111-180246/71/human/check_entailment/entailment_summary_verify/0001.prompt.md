You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
Let's imagine the surface of Mars as an infinite coordinate plane. Initially,
the rover Perseverance-2 and the helicopter Ingenuity-2 are located at the
point with coordinates (0, 0) . A set of instructions s consisting of n
instructions of the following types was specially developed for them:

  * N: move one meter north (from point (x, y) to (x, y + 1) ); 
  * S: move one meter south (from point (x, y) to (x, y - 1) ); 
  * E: move one meter east (from point (x, y) to (x + 1, y) ); 
  * W: move one meter west (from point (x, y) to (x - 1, y) ). 

Each instruction must be executed either by the rover or by the helicopter.
Moreover, each device must execute at least one instruction. Your task is to
distribute the instructions in such a way that after executing all n
instructions, the helicopter and the rover end up at the same point, or
determine that this is impossible.

Input

The first line of input contains t (1 \leq t \leq 10^4 ) — the number of test
cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 2
\cdot 10^5 ) — the number of instructions.

The second line of each test case contains a string s of length n consisting
of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' — the sequence of instructions.

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 2 \cdot
10 ^ 5 .

Output

For each test case, if the required distribution of instructions exists,
output a string p of length n consisting of the characters 'R', 'H'. If the i
-th operation should be executed by the rover, then p_i=\text{R} , if the i
-th operation should be executed by the helicopter, then p_i=\text{H} . If
there are multiple solutions, output any of them.

Otherwise, output NO.

Note

Let's consider the first example: the string S = \texttt{NENSNE} . One of the
possible solutions, shown in the figure below, is p = \texttt{RRHRRH} , using
which both the rover and the helicopter will end up one meter north and one
meter east.

For WWW, the solution is impossible.

- Program:
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
t = int(data[0])
index = 1
results = []
for _ in range(t):
    n = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    s = data[index]
    index += 1
    results.append(func_1(n, s))
print('\n'.join(results))

    count_west = 0
    for char in s:

            if s[i] == 'N':
                result.append('R')
                count_north -= 1
            else:
                result.append('H')
                count_south -= 1
            i += 1
        elif s[i] == 'E' or s[i] == 'W':
            if s[i] == 'E':
                result.append('R')
                count_east -= 1
            else:
                result.append('H')

    return ''.join(result)



- Function Summary: 
The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` such that \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\) and a string `s` consisting of the characters 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W' with length `n`. It first counts the occurrences of each character ('N', 'S', 'E', 'W') in the string `s`. If the counts of 'N' and 'S' are not equal or the counts of 'E' and 'W' are not equal, the function returns 'NO'. Otherwise, it constructs a string consisting of 'H' and 'R' based on the values of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W' in `s`, ensuring that the counts of 'N' and 'S' are balanced and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are balanced. The final state of the program after the function concludes is that it returns either 'NO' or a string composed of 'H' and 'R' depending on the balance of the counts of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W'.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down its functionality and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input. It splits the input data and processes each test case separately. This part is correct and handles the input format as specified.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function counts the occurrences of each type of movement ('N', 'S', 'E', 'W') in the string `s`.
   - It checks if the number of north moves equals the number of south moves and the number of east moves equals the number of west moves. If these conditions are not met, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the conditions are met, it iterates through the string `s` again, distributing the moves between the rover and the helicopter based on their respective types ('N', 'S' for the helicopter and 'E', 'W' for the rover). It ensures that both devices get an equal share of each type of move.

3. **Output Generation**: The function constructs a string `result` based on which device should perform each move. If the distribution is possible, it returns the constructed string; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly identifies whether it's possible to distribute the instructions so that the rover and the helicopter end up at the same point. The program also generates a valid distribution when possible.

Therefore, the provided program correctly implements the logic as per the problem statement.
