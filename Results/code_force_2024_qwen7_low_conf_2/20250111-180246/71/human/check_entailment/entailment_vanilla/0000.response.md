Reasoning:
To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's break down its functionality and compare it with the problem requirements.

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads multiple test cases from standard input. It splits the input data and processes each test case separately. This part is correct and handles the input format as specified.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function counts the occurrences of each type of movement ('N', 'S', 'E', 'W') in the string `s`.
   - It checks if the number of north moves equals the number of south moves and the number of east moves equals the number of west moves. If these conditions are not met, it returns 'NO'.
   - If the conditions are met, it iterates through the string `s` again, distributing the moves between the rover and the helicopter based on their respective types ('N', 'S' for the helicopter and 'E', 'W' for the rover). It ensures that both devices get an equal share of each type of move.

3. **Output Generation**: The function constructs a string `result` based on which device should perform each move. If the distribution is possible, it returns the constructed string; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.

Given the problem constraints and the logic implemented in the program, the program correctly identifies whether it's possible to distribute the instructions so that the rover and the helicopter end up at the same point. The program also generates a valid distribution when possible.

Therefore, the provided program correctly implements the logic as per the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
