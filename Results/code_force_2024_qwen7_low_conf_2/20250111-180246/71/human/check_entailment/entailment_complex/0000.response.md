Reasoning:

1. **Function Analysis**: The function `func_1` correctly processes the input string `s` and checks if the counts of 'N' and 'S' as well as 'E' and 'W' are equal. This is crucial for determining whether it is possible to distribute the instructions so that both the rover and the helicopter end up at the same point.

2. **Handling Imbalance**: If the counts of 'N' and 'S' are not equal or the counts of 'E' and 'W' are not equal, the function correctly returns 'NO'. This ensures that the distribution of instructions cannot balance the positions of the rover and the helicopter.

3. **Balanced Counts**: When the counts of 'N' and 'S' are equal and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are equal, the function constructs a string `result` that alternates between 'R' and 'H' to ensure that the rover and the helicopter move in a balanced manner. This ensures that the final positions of the rover and the helicopter are the same.

4. **Edge Cases**: The function handles edge cases where the string `s` might consist only of 'N' and 'S' or only 'E' and 'W' or a mix, but still maintains the balance of movements.

5. **Output Format**: The function returns 'NO' if the conditions are not met, and otherwise, it returns a string of 'R' and 'H' indicating which device should execute each instruction. The format matches the problem statement requirements.

Given the analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic needed to solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
