Reasoning:
The program correctly follows the steps outlined in the problem statement and the execution summary. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Reading Input**: The program reads all inputs from standard input and splits them into manageable parts.
2. **Processing Each Test Case**: For each test case, it correctly counts the occurrences of 'N', 'S', 'E', and 'W'.
3. **Checking Balance**: The function `func_1` checks whether the counts of 'N' and 'S' are equal and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are equal. If not, it returns 'NO', which aligns with the requirement that both the helicopter and the rover must end up at the same point.
4. **Constructing Result String**: If the counts are balanced, the function constructs a string of 'H' and 'R' based on the counts, ensuring that the counts of 'N' and 'S' are balanced and the counts of 'E' and 'W' are balanced.

Given the logic and implementation, the program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description and execution summary.

Correctness: **True**
