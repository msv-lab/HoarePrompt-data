The function reads three lists `n`, `k`, `v`, and `x` from the standard input, where `n` is the number of elements, `k` is an integer, `v` is a list of integers, and `x` is a list of integers representing positions. It then calculates a list `put_all_on_right` which stores the sum of values in `v` corresponding to the absolute values in `x`. After that, it checks whether `my_power` (initially set to `k`) can handle the sums in `put_all_on_right` by decrementing `my_power` by each value in `put_all_on_right` and then adding `k` back. If `my_power` becomes less than any value in `put_all_on_right`, it prints 'NO' and returns. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return anything and operates based on the input provided.
