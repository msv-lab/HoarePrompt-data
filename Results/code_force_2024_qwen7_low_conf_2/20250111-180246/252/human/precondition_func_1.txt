t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^9. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are integers where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
