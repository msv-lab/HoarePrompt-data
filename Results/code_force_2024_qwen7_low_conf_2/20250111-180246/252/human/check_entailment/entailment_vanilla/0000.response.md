Reasoning:
1. The problem requires determining if it's possible to survive and kill all `n` monsters without any reaching the player's starting position (point 0).
2. The solution provided uses two functions:
   - `func_1()` handles a single test case.
   - `func_2()` iterates through multiple test cases using `func_1()`.
3. In `func_1()`, the algorithm calculates the maximum health that can reach the player within a certain distance by summing the health values of monsters at each position from 1 to `n`.
4. It then simulates the process where the player can use `k` bullets per second to reduce the health of monsters.
5. The key logic checks if at any point the total health of monsters at a distance `i` is more than what can be handled by `k` bullets (`my_power < put_all_on_right[i]`). If this condition is met, the player cannot survive and "NO" is printed.
6. Otherwise, the player's effective power is updated (`my_power -= put_all_on_right[i]` and `my_power += k`) and the process continues until all monsters are either killed or the player cannot handle the incoming health.

Given the logic and the problem constraints, the implementation seems to correctly simulate the scenario described. It accurately checks whether the player can survive and kill all monsters.

Correctness: **True**
