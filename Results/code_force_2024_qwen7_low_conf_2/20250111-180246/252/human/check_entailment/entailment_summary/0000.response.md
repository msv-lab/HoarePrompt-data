Reasoning:
- The problem requires determining whether a player can kill all monsters before they reach the player's position (point 0) while firing up to `k` bullets per second.
- `func_1()` is responsible for processing a single test case. It reads the number of monsters `n` and the number of bullets `k`, followed by the health values `v` and positions `x` of the monsters.
- The logic within `func_1()` involves calculating the total health of monsters that could potentially be at any position relative to the player (`put_all_on_right`). This calculation considers the absolute positions of the monsters because the problem states that monsters can move towards the player.
- The function then iterates through these positions, checking if the player's power (`my_power` initialized to `k`) is sufficient to kill the monsters at each position. If `my_power` falls below the sum of the healths of monsters at any position, the function prints 'NO' and returns immediately.
- If the function completes the iteration without running out of power, it prints 'YES', indicating that the player can survive and kill all monsters.
- `func_2()` is responsible for handling multiple test cases. It reads the number of test cases `t` and then calls `func_1()` for each test case.
- Since both functions (`func_1()` and `func_2()`) follow the logic described in the problem statement and handle inputs and outputs as required, the entire program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
