Reasoning:
- The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_1` processes a single test case, reading in the necessary inputs (`n`, `k`, `v`, and `x`), calculating the required `put_all_on_right` array, and determining whether the player can survive based on the calculated values and `my_power`.
- `func_2` iterates over the number of test cases (`t`) and calls `func_1` for each test case.
- The logic in `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of health points of monsters at each possible distance from the player, ensuring that the player can handle the total health points of monsters within that distance with `my_power`.
- The overall logic ensures that for each test case, the player can either survive by having sufficient `my_power` or fail if the `my_power` is insufficient.
- The implementation correctly handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem statement.

Based on the analysis, the provided program correctly implements the logic to determine whether the player can survive and kill all monsters in each test case.

Correctness: **True**
