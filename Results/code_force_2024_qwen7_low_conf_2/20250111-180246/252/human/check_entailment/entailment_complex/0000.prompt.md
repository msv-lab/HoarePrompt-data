You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct based on the problem description and the execution states of the program provided as comments. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem. The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.

First explain your reasoning  then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
You are playing a computer game. The current level of this game can be modeled
as a straight line. Your character is in point 0 of this line. There are n
monsters trying to kill your character; the i -th monster has health equal to
a_i and is initially in the point x_i .

Every second, the following happens:

  * first, you fire up to k bullets at monsters. Each bullet targets exactly one monster and decreases its health by 1 . For each bullet, you choose its target arbitrary (for example, you can fire all bullets at one monster, fire all bullets at different monsters, or choose any other combination). Any monster can be targeted by a bullet, regardless of its position and any other factors; 
  * then, all alive monsters with health 0 or less die; 
  * then, all alive monsters move 1 point closer to you (monsters to the left of you increase their coordinates by 1 , monsters to the right of you decrease their coordinates by 1 ). If any monster reaches your character (moves to the point 0 ), you lose. 

Can you survive and kill all n monsters without letting any of them reach your
character?

Input

The first line of the input contains one integer t (1 \le t \le 3 \cdot 10^4 )
— the number of test cases.

Each test case consists of three lines:

  * the first line contains two integers n and k (1 \le n \le 3 \cdot 10^5 ; 1 \le k \le 2 \cdot 10^9 ); 
  * the second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9 ); 
  * the third line contains n integers x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n (-n \le x_1 < x_2 < x_3 < \dots < x_n \le n ; x_i \ne 0 ). 

Additional constraint on the input: the sum of n over all test cases does not
exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print YES if you can kill all n monsters before they reach
your character, or NO otherwise.

You can output each letter of the answer in any case (upper or lower). For
example, the strings yEs, yes, Yes, and YES will all be recognized as positive
responses.

    3 2
    
    1 2 3
    
    -1 2 3
    
    2 1
    
    1 1
    
    -1 1
    
    4 10
    
    3 4 2 5
    
    -3 -2 1 3
    
    5 3
    
    2 1 3 2 5
    
    -3 -2 3 4 5
    
    2 1
    
    1 2
    
    1 2

Output

    YES
    NO
    YES
    YES
    NO
    
Note

In the first example, you can act as follows:

  * during the 1 -st second, fire 1 bullet at the 1 -st monster and 1 bullet at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 1 -st monster dies, the 2 -nd and the 3 -rd monster move closer; 
  * during the 2 -nd second, fire 2 bullets at the 2 -nd monster. Then the 2 -nd monster dies, the 3 -rd monster moves closer; 
  * during the 3 -rd second, fire 2 bullets at the 3 -rd monster. Then the 3 -rd monster dies. 

In the second example, you can fire only 1 bullet, so you can kill only one of
the two monsters during the 1 -st second. Then, the remaining monster moves
closer and kills your character.

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9, v is a list of n integers where 1 ≤ v_i ≤ 10^9, and x is a list of n integers where -n ≤ x_i < x_{i+1} ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_1():

    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    put_all_on_right = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        put_all_on_right[abs(x[i])] += v[i]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `v` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\), `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `put_all_on_right` is a list of \(n + 1\) integers, where for each index \(i\), `put_all_on_right[i]` is the sum of `v[j]` for all \(j\) such that `abs(x[j]) = i`.
    my_power = k
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if my_power < put_all_on_right[i]:
            print('NO')
            return
        
        my_power -= put_all_on_right[i]
        
        my_power += k
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `my_power` is equal to the original value of `my_power` minus the sum of all `put_all_on_right[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` plus `n * k`.
    print('YES')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three lists `n`, `k`, `v`, and `x` from the standard input, where `n` is the number of elements, `k` is an integer, `v` is a list of integers, and `x` is a list of integers representing positions. It then calculates a list `put_all_on_right` which stores the sum of values in `v` corresponding to the absolute values in `x`. After that, it checks whether `my_power` (initially set to `k`) can handle the sums in `put_all_on_right` by decrementing `my_power` by each value in `put_all_on_right` and then adding `k` back. If `my_power` becomes less than any value in `put_all_on_right`, it prints 'NO' and returns. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return anything and operates based on the input provided.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4. For each test case, n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^9. a_1, a_2, ..., a_n are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and x_1, x_2, ..., x_n are integers where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.
def func_2():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        func_1()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes multiple test cases, where for each test case, it reads two integers \(n\) and \(k\), along with two lists of integers \(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\) and \(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n\). It then calls a function `func_1()` for each test case to process these inputs. After executing the loop, the function returns nothing (i.e., it does not return any value). The function accepts an integer `t` representing the number of test cases, where \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\). There are no explicit postconditions mentioned for the function itself, and the return postconditions indicate that the function does not return any value. However, it is implied that `func_1()` should process the inputs for each test case according to its specifications.
