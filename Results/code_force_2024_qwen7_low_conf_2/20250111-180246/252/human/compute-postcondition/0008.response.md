The function `func_2` accepts a single parameter `t`, which is an integer representing the number of test cases. The value of `t` satisfies the constraint 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4. For each test case, the function processes two additional integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^9. Additionally, the function receives a list of `n` integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, and another list of `n` integers `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` where -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0.

The output of the function depends on the specific implementation within the function body, but based on the constraints provided, the function processes these inputs for each test case.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4. For each test case, it processes two integers `n` and `k`, and lists of integers `a_1, a_2, ..., a_n` and `x_1, x_2, ..., x_n` under specified constraints. The function returns the result of processing these inputs for each test case.**
