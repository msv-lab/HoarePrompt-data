The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated integers as input and assigns them to variables `n` and `k` respectively. Since the input is not provided in this example, we can represent the values of `n` and `k` as generic integers from the input.

The initial state does not specify the exact values of `n` and `k`, so after executing the code, `n` and `k` will hold the integers entered by the user. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input**
