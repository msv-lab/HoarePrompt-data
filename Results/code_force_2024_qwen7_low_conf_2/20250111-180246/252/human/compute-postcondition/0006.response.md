The function `func_1()` is called, but its implementation is not provided in the initial state or the code snippet. Since the exact behavior of `func_1()` is not specified, we cannot determine what changes it might make to the variables. The only information given is that `t` is initially 1. Calling `func_1()` does not assign a new value to `t` or any other variables mentioned, so `t` remains 1.

Output State: **`t` is 1**
