Output State: **`my_power` is equal to the original value of `my_power` minus the sum of all `put_all_on_right[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` plus `n * k`.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `i = n`.
- In each iteration, `my_power` is updated by subtracting `put_all_on_right[i]` and then adding `k`.
- After the loop completes, `my_power` will have gone through these updates for each `i` from `1` to `n`.

Mathematically, if we denote the original value of `my_power` as `my_power_original`, the final value of `my_power` can be expressed as:
\[ \text{my\_power} = \text{my\_power\_original} - (put\_all\_on\_right[1] + put\_all\_on\_right[2] + \ldots + put\_all\_on\_right[n]) + n \times k \]

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is `0`), then `my_power` remains `my_power_original` because there are no iterations to modify `my_power`.
