The code snippet prints 'YES', but it does not assign any new values to the variables. Therefore, the only change is the printed statement, and the initial state of the variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`my_power` is equal to the original value of `my_power` minus the sum of all `put_all_on_right[i]` for `i` from 1 to `n` plus `n * k`, printed statement is 'YES'**
