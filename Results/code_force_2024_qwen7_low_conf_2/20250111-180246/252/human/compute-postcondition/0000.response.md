`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `t` is now an integer representing the number of test cases, and other variables remain in their initial state as per the precondition. The states of `n`, `k`, `a_i`, and `x_i` are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, where 1 ≤ t ≤ 3⋅10^4. For each test case, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3⋅10^5 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 2⋅10^9. `a_i` and `x_i` are integers where 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and -n ≤ x_1 < x_2 < ... < x_n ≤ n and x_i ≠ 0. `t` is set to the value of `int(input())`.**
