The function `func_1()` is called, but its implementation is not provided. Without knowing what `func_1()` does, we cannot determine the changes it might make to the variables. However, we know that `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases and \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\). The call to `func_1()` itself does not modify the value of `t`.

Therefore, the only thing we can say for certain is that `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\)**
