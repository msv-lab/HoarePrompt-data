Postcondition: ***`bullets` is `k * x[index] - a[i]`, `n` is greater than 0, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `x` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, `last_pos` is either 1, 2, 3, or 4 depending on the value of `i`, and if the current value of `bullets` is less than 0, the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part provided.***
