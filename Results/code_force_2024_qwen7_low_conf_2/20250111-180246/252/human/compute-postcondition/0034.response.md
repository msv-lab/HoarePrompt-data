Functionality: **The function reads three lists `n`, `k`, `v`, and `x` from the standard input, where `n` is the number of elements, `k` is an integer, `v` is a list of integers, and `x` is a list of integers representing positions. It then calculates a list `put_all_on_right` which stores the sum of values in `v` corresponding to the absolute values in `x`. After that, it checks whether `my_power` (initially set to `k`) can handle the sums in `put_all_on_right` by decrementing `my_power` by each value in `put_all_on_right` and then adding `k` back. If `my_power` becomes less than any value in `put_all_on_right`, it prints 'NO' and returns. Otherwise, it prints 'YES'. The function does not return anything and operates based on the input provided.**

**Edge Cases:**
- If `n` or `k` are out of the specified ranges (i.e., `n > 3 * 10^5` or `k > 2 * 10^9`), the function will still operate within those constraints, but inputs outside these ranges might lead to unexpected behavior.
- If `v` contains values greater than `10^9` or `x` contains invalid indices (i.e., `x_i < -n` or `x_i >= n`), the function will still process them, but the results may be incorrect.
- If `put_all_on_right[i]` is zero for all `i` from 1 to `n`, the function will print 'YES' because `my_power` will never be less than any value in `put_all_on_right`.

**Missing Functionality:**
- The function does not validate the input constraints (`1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5` and `1 ≤ k ≤ 2 ⋅ 10^9`) explicitly. This means it could potentially fail or behave unexpectedly if the input does not meet these constraints.
