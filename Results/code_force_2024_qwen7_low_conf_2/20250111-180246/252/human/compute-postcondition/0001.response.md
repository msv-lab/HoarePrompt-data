Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The variable `t` is set to the value of `int(input())`. This means that `t` is now an integer representing the number of test cases, and `t` must satisfy the condition \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\).

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop will run as long as `_` is less than `t`. Here, `_` is a dummy variable used in the `range(t)` function to iterate `t` times.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to make sure that `t` is valid (i.e., within the given range) before entering the loop. Additionally, since the loop runs `t` times, the initial state of `t` directly influences the loop's behavior.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `t` is within the specified range and that the loop can execute properly.

**State:**
- `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\).

In summary:
State: **`t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\)**.
