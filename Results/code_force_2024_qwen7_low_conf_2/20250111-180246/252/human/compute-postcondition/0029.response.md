`my_power` is decremented by `put_all_on_right[i]`. Since `i` is 3, the decrement is by `put_all_on_right[3]`. The value of `my_power` after this operation is the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[3]`. No other variables are affected.

Given the postcondition, if `my_power < put_all_on_right[i]`, the function returns None. However, since the exact value of `my_power` before the decrement is not specified, we cannot determine if the condition is met or not. Therefore, the output state retains the initial state with the updated value of `my_power`.

Output State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `my_power` is equal to the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[3]`.**
