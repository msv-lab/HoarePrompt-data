Postcondition: ***`bullets` is adjusted based on the value of `k * (x[i] - last_pos)` where `last_pos` is now `x[i]`; `n` remains greater than 0; `bullets` is reduced by `a[i]`, and `k` and `a` remain as input integers and lists respectively. If `bullets` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
