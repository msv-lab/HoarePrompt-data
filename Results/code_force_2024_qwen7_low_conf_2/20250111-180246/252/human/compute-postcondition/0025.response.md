Let's analyze the given information step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is 2
   - `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)
   - `my_power` is equal to the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `2k` minus `put_all_on_right[2]`

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates from `1` to `n` inclusive.
   - Therefore, the loop will execute as long as `i < n + 1`.

3. **Current State After Previous Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is currently 2, the loop will continue if `i` is less than `n + 1`.

4. **Next Iteration:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, making it `i = 3`.
   - To satisfy the condition `i < n + 1`, `n` must remain within its bounds and must be such that `3 <= n`.

5. **Adjusting States:**
   - `i` will become `3`.
   - `n` remains unchanged and still must be within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\).
   - The value of `my_power` does not change based on the loop itself but depends on the values of `put_all_on_right[1]`, `put_all_on_right[2]`, and `k`.

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `i` becomes `3`
- `n` remains an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\)
- `my_power` remains unchanged

Therefore, the updated state for the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`i` is 3, `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `my_power` is equal to the original value of `my_power` minus `put_all_on_right[1]` plus `2k` minus `put_all_on_right[2]`**
