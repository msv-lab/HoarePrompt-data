The code `my_power = k` assigns the value of `k` to the variable `my_power`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), `k` is an integer where \(1 \leq k \leq 2 \cdot 10^9\), `v` is a list of \(n\) integers where \(1 \leq v_i \leq 10^9\), `x` is a list of integers read from the input, `put_all_on_right` is a list of \(n + 1\) integers, where for each index \(i\), `put_all_on_right[i]` is the sum of `v[j]` for all \(j\) such that `abs(x[j]) = i`, `my_power` is equal to `k**`.**
