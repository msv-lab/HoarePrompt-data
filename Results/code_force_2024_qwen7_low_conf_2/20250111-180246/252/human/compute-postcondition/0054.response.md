The code `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' and does not affect any variables. Therefore, the values of all the variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Output State: **`bullets` is `-2 * a[2]`, `last_pos` is 4, `x` is [1, 3, 4], `n` is 2, `k` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, and `i` is 2.**
