Postcondition: ***`bullets` is `-a[i]`, `last_pos` is either 1, 3, or 4, `x` is [1, 3, 4], `n` is 2, `k` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input. Since the if condition is not met (i.e., `bullets >= 0`), no changes are made to the variables and the same values persist as in the precondition.***
