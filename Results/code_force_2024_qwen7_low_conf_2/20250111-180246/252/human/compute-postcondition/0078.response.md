Postcondition: ***`bullets` is adjusted based on the value of `i`. If `bullets` is less than 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Specifically, `bullets` is set to `k * x[index] - 2*a[i] - k` if `i = 0`, `k * x[index] - 2*a[i]` if `i = 1`, `k * x[index] - 2*a[i] + k` if `i = 2`, and `k * x[index] - 2*a[i] + 2k` if `i = 3`. `last_pos` is either `1`, `2`, `3`, or `4` depending on the value of `i + 1`. `n` remains greater than 0, and `k` and `a` remain as input integers and lists respectively.***
