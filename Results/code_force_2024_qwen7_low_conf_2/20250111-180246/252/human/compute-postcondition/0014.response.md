The code `print('NO')` does not affect any variable values. It only prints 'NO' to the console. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`total` is not mentioned in the loop context, `i` is 1, `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\), and `my_power` is less than `put_all_on_right[i]`. A value 'NO' is printed to the console.**
