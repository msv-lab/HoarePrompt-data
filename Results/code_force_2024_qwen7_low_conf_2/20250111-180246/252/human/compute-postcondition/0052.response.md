The code `last_pos = x[i]` assigns the value of `x[i]` to `last_pos`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2, and `x` is `[1, 3, 4]`. Therefore, `x[2]` is 4.

So, `last_pos` is assigned the value 4. The other variables remain unchanged in their values. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`bullets` is `-a[2] + k * (x[2] - last_pos)`, `last_pos` is 4, `x` is [1, 3, 4], `n` is 2, `k` is 1, `a` is a list of integers from the input, and `i` is 2**
