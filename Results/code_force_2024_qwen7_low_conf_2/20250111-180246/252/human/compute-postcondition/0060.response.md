The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` reads a line of input, splits it into individual elements, converts each element to an integer, and stores them in a list `a`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Let's assume the input for `input().split()` results in a list of integers `[p1, p2, ..., pn]` where `n` is the length of this list. The variables `n` and `k` retain their initial integer values from the input, and `a` is updated to the list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from the input, `k` is an integer from the input; `a` is a list of integers from the input**
