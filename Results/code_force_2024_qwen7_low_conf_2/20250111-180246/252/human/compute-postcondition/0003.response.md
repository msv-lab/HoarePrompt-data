According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `t`. The loop iterates for each test case represented by `t`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` is an integer representing the number of test cases, and \(1 \leq t \leq 3 \cdot 10^4\). For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1.

Since the loop decrements `t` by 1 in each iteration (though the exact operation within the loop body is not specified), `t` will be reduced by 1 at the start of each new iteration. Therefore, if `t` was 2 at the end of the previous iteration, it will become 1 at the start of the current iteration and the loop will stop. To allow the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be 2 at the end of the previous iteration.

State: **`t` is 2**
