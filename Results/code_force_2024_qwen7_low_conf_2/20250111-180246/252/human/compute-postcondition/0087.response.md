Output State: **`bullets` is the result of the summation of `k * (x[i] - last_pos)` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1` minus the summation of `a[i]` for all `i` from 0 to `n-1`, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is an integer from the input, `a` is a list of integers from the input, `x` is a sorted list of the absolute values of the integers entered in the input, `last_pos` is the last position updated within the loop, and if `bullets` is less than 0 at any point during the loop execution, the loop breaks and "NO" is printed. Otherwise, "YES" is printed.**
