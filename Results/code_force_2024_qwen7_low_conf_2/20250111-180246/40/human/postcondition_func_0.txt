The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and `p` (a sorted list of integers where |pi| ≤ n). It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of length (2 * n + 1) and sets the middle element to 1. It then iterates through the DP array, updating it based on the current and adjacent values, ensuring that only positive values contribute to the new DP array. After the loop, it calculates `final_sum` as the last element of `p` adjusted by `offset` (which is equal to `n`). Finally, it returns the value at index `final_sum` in the updated DP array, adjusted by the modulo value `MOD`. This process effectively computes a specific value derived from the input list `p` and the parameter `n`, ensuring all intermediate results respect the modulo constraint. Potential edge cases include the smallest and largest possible values of `n` and the empty list scenario for `p`, though the latter is not explicitly handled in the code.
