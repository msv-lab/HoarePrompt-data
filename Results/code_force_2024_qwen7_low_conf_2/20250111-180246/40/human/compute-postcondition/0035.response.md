The function `func_2` accepts no parameters directly in the given function signature but implies that it processes data through some external or predefined variables. However, based on the provided constraints, it seems the function should accept the following parameters:

- `t`: a positive integer indicating the number of test cases.
- `n`: a positive integer indicating the size of the hidden array `a`.
- `p`: a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array `a`, where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.

Given the output cases are not explicitly provided in the problem statement, we focus on the parameters accepted by the function.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `t` (a positive integer indicating the number of test cases), `n` (a positive integer indicating the size of the hidden array `a`), and `p` (a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array `a` where \( |p_i| \leq n \) and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order).**
