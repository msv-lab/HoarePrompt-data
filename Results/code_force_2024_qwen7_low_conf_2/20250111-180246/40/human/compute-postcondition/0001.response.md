`data` is assigned the value of `input().split()`, which splits the input string into a list of strings based on whitespace. The variables `t`, `n`, and `p` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases; `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the hidden array a; `p` is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a, where |p_i| â‰¤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string**
