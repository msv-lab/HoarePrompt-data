According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one element left in `results`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `t` must be at least 1, and `res` is its original value. This implies that `res` was used in some operation during the loop, but we don't have specific information about what happened to `t` or `res` during the loop body.

For the loop to execute one more time, `results` must have at least one more element. The state of `t` and `res` does not change the condition for the loop to continue, as long as there are elements in `results`.

State: **`t` must be at least 1, `res` is its original value, and `results` must have at least one more element**
