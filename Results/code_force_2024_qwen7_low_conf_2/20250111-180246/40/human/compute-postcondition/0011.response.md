The function `func_1(n, p)` is called with arguments `n` and `p`. The value of `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, and `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`. After calling the function, the result is stored in `result`. However, since the function `func_1` is not defined, its exact behavior is unknown. We know that `t`, `index`, `n`, and `p` will retain their initial values unless `func_1` modifies them. Since no such modification is indicated, the variables `t`, `index`, `n`, and `p` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `index` is `1 + data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**
