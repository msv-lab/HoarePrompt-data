The initial state provides the following:
- `t` is 2
- `index` is calculated as `2 + data[0] + int(data[1 + data[0]])`
- `n` is `int(data[1 + data[0]])`
- `p` is a list of integers from `data[2 + data[0]]` to `data[2 + data[0] + int(data[1 + data[0]]) - 1]`
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
- `results` is `[result, result]`

The code snippet updates `result` by calling `func_1(n, p)`. Since `result` is re-assigned, it will now hold the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

Given this, the output state will include:
- `t` remains 2
- `index` remains unchanged (as no code modifies it)
- `n` remains unchanged (as no code modifies it)
- `p` remains unchanged (as no code modifies it)
- `result` is now the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
- `results` is updated to `[result, result]`

Thus, the Output State is:
**`t` is 2, `index` is `2 + data[0] + int(data[1 + data[0]])`, `n` is `int(data[1 + data[0]])`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[2 + data[0]]` to `data[2 + data[0] + int(data[1 + data[0]]) - 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is `[result, result]`**
