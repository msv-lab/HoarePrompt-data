The code initializes the variable `index` to 0. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, and `data`). Therefore, the only change is that `index` is now set to 0.

Output State: **`t` is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases; `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the hidden array a; `p` is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a, where |p_i| â‰¤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string; `index` is 0**.
