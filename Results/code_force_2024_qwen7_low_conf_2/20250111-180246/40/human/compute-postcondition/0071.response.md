`new_dp[j + 1]` is assigned the value of `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Given the initial state, `j` is 1, and `new_dp` is updated based on `dp[1]` if `dp[1] > 0`. This means:

1. Since `j` is 1, `j + 1` is 2.
2. The value of `new_dp[2]` is updated to `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD`.

Therefore, the output state is: `dp` and `new_dp` are equal, `j` is 1, `new_dp[2]` is updated to `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD`.

Output State: **`dp` and `new_dp` are equal, `j` is 1, `new_dp[2]` is updated to `(new_dp[2] + dp[1]) % MOD`**
