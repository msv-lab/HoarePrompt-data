The code updates `new_dp[j + 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to `new_dp[j + 1]` and taking the modulo with `MOD`. Given the initial state, `dp[j + 1]` is greater than 0, and if `j` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j]` is updated, if `j + 2` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 2]` is updated. After executing the line `new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, the value of `new_dp[j + 1]` changes, while the other conditions remain the same.

Output State: **`dp[j + 1]` is greater than 0, if `j` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j]` is updated, if `j + 2` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 2]` is updated, `new_dp[j + 1]` is `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**
