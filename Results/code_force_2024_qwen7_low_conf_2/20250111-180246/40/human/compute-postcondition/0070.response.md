Let's analyze the given state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `dp` and `new_dp` are equal.
- If `dp[j] > 0`, then:
  - `new_dp[2]` is updated to `((prev_new_dp[2] + dp[3]) % MOD + dp[1]) % MOD`
  - `new_dp[4]` is updated to `dp[3] % MOD`
  - `new_dp[0]` is updated to `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD` if `j - 1 >= 0`, and if `j - 1` is 0, `new_dp[0]` is updated to `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD` if `i` is 2.
- If `dp[j] <= 0`, the values remain unchanged.
- The loop runs from `j` in `range(2 * n + 1)`.

### For Loop:
```python
for j in range(2 * n + 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop condition is based on the value of `j` within the range `range(2 * n + 1)`. This means the loop will run for each value of `j` from 0 to `2 * n`.

2. **Previous State**: At the end of the previous iteration, we know that:
   - `dp` and `new_dp` are equal.
   - Specific updates were made based on the value of `dp[j]`.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - The loop will start with `j = 0` if it has not yet reached `2 * n`.
   - If `j = 0`, the loop will update the values in `new_dp` based on the conditions provided.
   - If `j > 0`, the loop will continue updating `new_dp` based on the same conditions.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since the loop starts with `j` incremented by 1 (from 0), the next value of `j` will be `1`.
   - We need to check if `dp[1]` is greater than 0 or not to determine the updates to `new_dp`.
   - If `dp[1] > 0`, the following updates will be made:
     - `new_dp[2]` will be updated to `((prev_new_dp[2] + dp[3]) % MOD + dp[1]) % MOD`
     - `new_dp[4]` will be updated to `dp[3] % MOD`
     - `new_dp[0]` will be updated to `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD` if `j - 1 >= 0`, and if `j - 1` is 0, `new_dp[0]` will be updated to `(new_dp[0] + dp[1]) % MOD` if `i` is 2.
   - If `dp[1] <= 0`, no updates will be made to `new_dp`.

### Final State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `dp` remains the same as it is not modified in the loop body.
- `new_dp` will be updated based on the value of `dp[1]`.
- `j` will be 1.
- `i` is not specified in the loop body but is likely used to determine the condition for updating `new_dp[0]` when `j - 1` is 0.

Thus, the final state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

**State: **`dp` and `new_dp` are equal, `j` is 1, `new_dp` is updated based on `dp[1]` if `dp[1] > 0`.**
