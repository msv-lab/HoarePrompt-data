The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `p`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, and `p` is a list of `n` integers where |pi| ≤ n and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function returns `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset` and `p[-1]` is the last element of list `p` adjusted by `offset`. `dp` is a list of length (2 * n + 1) where each element `dp[j]` (with 0 ≤ j ≤ 2 * n) is the sum of `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `p`, where `n` is an integer within a specified range and `p` is a sorted list of integers. It returns `dp[final_sum]`, where `final_sum` is the last element of `p` adjusted by an `offset`, and `dp` is a list calculated based on the specified conditions and adjusted by `MOD`.**
