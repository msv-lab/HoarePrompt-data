Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `res` is the last printed element from the `results` list, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `results` must have at least `t` elements.** 

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Setup**: The initial state defines the variables `t`, `index`, `n`, `p`, `result`, and `results`. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list and prints it.
2. **Loop Execution**: The loop continues to execute as long as there are elements in the `results` list. After each iteration, `res` takes the value of the current element being processed from `results`.
3. **Final State**: After all iterations, `res` will hold the last element printed from the `results` list, and `results` will contain the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, with at least `t` elements. If the loop does not execute (`t` is 0), then `results` remains an empty list, and `res` does not change from its original value (which is undefined in this context but can be considered as the initial value).

Thus, the final state after the loop completes all iterations is as described above.
