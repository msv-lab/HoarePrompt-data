The code `p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))` impacts the following:
- It slices `data` from index `index` to `index + n` and converts each element in this slice to an integer using the `map` function, then converts the map object to a list.
- `p` is assigned the resulting list.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is at least 1
- `index` is 1
- `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`

After executing the code, `p` will contain the integers from `data[index:index + n]`.

Since `index` is 1 and `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `p` will be the list of integers starting from `data[1]` and containing `n` elements.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `index` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`**
