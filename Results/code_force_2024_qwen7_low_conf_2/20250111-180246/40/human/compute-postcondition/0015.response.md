The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. Initially, `index` is set to `1 + data[0]`. Since the value of `data[0]` is not provided, we'll keep it in the form of `data[0]`. Therefore, after executing the code, `index` will be `2 + data[0]`.

All other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `result`, `results`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is 2, `index` is `2 + data[0]`, `n` is `int(data[1 + data[0]])`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is `[result, result]`**
