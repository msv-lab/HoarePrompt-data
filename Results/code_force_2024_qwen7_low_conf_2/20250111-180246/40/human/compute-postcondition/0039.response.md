To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop updates the `new_dp` array based on the current value of `j`.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify the initial conditions:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `dp[j]` is greater than 0.
   - If `j - 1` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
   - If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
   - Otherwise, there is no change to `new_dp[j + 1]`.

2. **Determine the next value of `j`:**
   - The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `2 * n`.

3. **Analyze the conditions for the next iteration:**
   - For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1.
   - We need to check if `j` is within the valid range for the loop.

4. **Check the conditions for updating `new_dp`:**
   - If `j - 1` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j - 1]` will be updated.
   - If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` will be updated.

5. **Adjust the states:**
   - Since `j` is incremented by 1, the new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - We need to ensure that the conditions for updating `new_dp` are met for the new value of `j`.

Given these steps, let's summarize the state at the start of the next iteration:

- `dp[j]` was greater than 0.
- After processing `j`, we need to check the conditions for `j + 1`.

Since the loop iterates from `0` to `2 * n`, the next value of `j` will be `j + 1`. We need to ensure that the conditions for updating `new_dp` are met for this new value of `j`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`dp[j + 1]` is greater than 0, if `j + 1 - 1` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j]` is updated to `(new_dp[j] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD`, if `j + 1 + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 2]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 2] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD`**.

However, since we don't have specific values for `j` and `dp[j + 1]`, we can generalize the state as:

State: **`dp[j + 1]` is greater than 0, if `j + 1 - 1` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j]` is updated, if `j + 1 + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 2]` is updated**.

In simpler terms, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

State: **`dp[j + 1]` is greater than 0, if `j` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j]` is updated, if `j + 2` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 2]` is updated**.

This captures the necessary conditions for the loop to continue executing.
