`final_sum` is assigned the value of `p[-1] + offset`. Here, `p[-1]` refers to the last element in the list `p`, which is derived from the list `dp`. The list `dp` is defined such that each element `dp[j]` is the sum of all positive elements in `dp` adjusted by modulo `MOD`. However, the specific value of `offset` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `final_sum`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`dp` is a list of length (2 * n + 1), where each element `dp[j]` (with `0 ≤ j ≤ 2 * n`) is the sum of `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`; `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000; `final_sum` is `p[-1] + offset`**
