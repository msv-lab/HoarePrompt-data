According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The loop runs for each value in the range of `t`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states are true:
- `t` is 2
- `index` is `2 + data[0] + int(data[1 + data[0]])`
- `n` is `int(data[1 + data[0]])`
- `p` is a list of integers from `data[2 + data[0]]` to `data[2 + data[0] + int(data[1 + data[0]]) - 1]`
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
- `results` is `[result, result, result]`

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is currently 2, it will decrement by 1 after the current iteration, so `t` will be 1. The other variables will be reset to their initial values for the next iteration.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. `t` must be decremented by 1, so `t` becomes 1.
2. `index` remains as `2 + data[0] + int(data[1 + data[0]])`.
3. `n` remains as `int(data[1 + data[0]])`.
4. `p` remains as a list of integers from `data[2 + data[0]]` to `data[2 + data[0] + int(data[1 + data[0]]) - 1]`.
5. `result` is undefined for the next iteration because `func_1(n, p)` is called only once per loop, and its result is stored in `results`.
6. `results` remains as `[result, result, result]` until the loop completes.

Therefore, the states to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `t` must be 1
- `index` remains the same
- `n` remains the same
- `p` remains the same
- `result` is undefined
- `results` remains the same

State: **`t` is 1, `index` is `2 + data[0] + int(data[1 + data[0]])`, `n` is `int(data[1 + data[0]])`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[2 + data[0]]` to `data[2 + data[0] + int(data[1 + data[0]]) - 1]`, `result` is undefined, `results` is `[result, result, result]`**
