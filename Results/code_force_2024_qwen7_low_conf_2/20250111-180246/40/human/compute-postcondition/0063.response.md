Postcondition: ***`dp` and `new_dp` are equal, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(prev_new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is equal to `dp[j] % MOD`, `i` is 2, and `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0. If `dp[j] > 0`, these updates are applied. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
