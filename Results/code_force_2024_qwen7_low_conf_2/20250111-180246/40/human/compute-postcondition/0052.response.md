The code `dp = new_dp` assigns the value of `new_dp` to `dp`. Given the initial state, `new_dp` is a list of length (2 * n + 1) where each element is the sum of the corresponding `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`. After executing this line of code, the value of `dp` will be updated to match `new_dp`, while `new_dp` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `new_dp` is a list of length (2 * n + 1) where each element is the sum of the corresponding `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`.**
