Postcondition: ***`dp` and `new_dp` are equal, `new_dp[2]` is either `((prev_new_dp[2] + dp[3]) % MOD + dp[1]) % MOD` if `dp[3] > 0` or remains as `(prev_new_dp[2] + dp[3]) % MOD`, `new_dp[4]` is either `dp[3] % MOD` if `dp[3] > 0` or remains unchanged, `i` is 2, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, and `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0.***
