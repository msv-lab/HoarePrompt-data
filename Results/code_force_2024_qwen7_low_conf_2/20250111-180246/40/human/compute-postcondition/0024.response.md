The code `index += n` increments the value of `index` by `n`. According to the initial state, `n` is `int(a2 + 2*a0 + a1)`. Therefore, `index` becomes `3 + 2*a0 + a1 + int(a2 + 2*a0 + a1)`. 

Other variables remain unchanged in their initial state.

Output State: **`t` remains 1; `index` is 3 + 2*a0 + a1 + int(a2 + 2*a0 + a1); `n` remains int(a2 + 2*a0 + a1); `p` remains a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `data[index]` and ending at `data[index + n - 1]`; `result` remains undefined; `results` remains `[result, result, result]`.**
