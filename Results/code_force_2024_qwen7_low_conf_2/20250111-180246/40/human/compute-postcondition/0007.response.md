`n` is assigned the value of `data[index]` converted to an integer. The value of `index` is 0, so `n` is assigned the first element of `data` converted to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `index` is 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`**
