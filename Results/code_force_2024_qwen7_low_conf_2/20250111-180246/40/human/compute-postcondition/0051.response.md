Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `new_dp` is a list of length (2 * n + 1) where each element is the sum of the corresponding `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State:** 
  - `i` is 2.
  - `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000.
  - `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of length (2 * n + 1) with all elements initially set to 0.
  
- **Loop Code:**
  ```python
  for j in range(2 * n + 1):
      if dp[j] > 0:
          if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
              new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
          if j - 1 >= 0:
              new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
  ```

- **Observation from Example Output States:**
  - After 1 iteration, `new_dp` is updated based on the condition `dp[j] > 0`.
  - After 2 iterations, `new_dp` continues to be updated based on the same condition.
  - After 3 iterations, `new_dp` is still updated based on the same condition.

- **Final Iterations:**
  - The loop will continue to update `new_dp` until every `dp[j]` that was initially greater than 0 has been processed.
  - Since the loop processes each valid `dp[j]` exactly once, after all iterations, `new_dp` will contain the final sums of the relevant `dp[j]` values, adjusted by modulo `MOD`.

- **Conclusion:**
  - After all iterations, `new_dp` will reflect the final state where each element is the sum of the corresponding `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`.
  - Since `dp` is equal to `new_dp` after each iteration, the final state of `dp` will also match this condition.

Thus, the output state of the loop is that `dp` is equal to `new_dp`, and `new_dp` is a list of length (2 * n + 1) where each element is the sum of the corresponding `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`.
