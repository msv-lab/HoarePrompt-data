Postcondition: ***`dp[j + 1]` is greater than 0, if `j` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j]` is updated, and if `j + 2` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 2]` is updated. Specifically, if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, and `new_dp[j - 1]` is also updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. No updates occur in the else case.***
