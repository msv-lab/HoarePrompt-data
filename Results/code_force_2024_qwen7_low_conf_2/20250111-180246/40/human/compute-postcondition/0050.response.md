Postcondition: ***`dp[j + 2]` is greater than 0 if `j + 1 >= 0` and `j + 2 <= 2 * n`. In this case, `new_dp[j + 3]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 3] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD` and `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD`. If these conditions are not met, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.***
