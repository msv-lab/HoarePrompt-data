Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `t` is a non-negative integer.
   - `index` is calculated as `t + data[0] * (t - 1)`.
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[t]` for each iteration.
   - `p` is a list of integers from `data[t + 1]` to `data[index - 1]`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration.
   - `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop iterates over each element in `results`.
   - For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

3. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `results` contains `t` elements, we need to ensure that `t` is at least 1 for the loop to execute.
   - We do not need to adjust the individual values of `n`, `p`, or `result` because these are computed within the loop itself based on the given conditions.

4. **Final State**:
   - The critical adjustment needed is ensuring that `t` is at least 1, because this guarantees that `results` will have at least one element.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

**State: **`t` must be at least 1**
