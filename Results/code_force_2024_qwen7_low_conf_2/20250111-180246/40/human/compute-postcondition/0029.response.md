The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of the variable `res`. The value of `res` is not assigned or modified within this line of code, so it remains unchanged. The precondition that `t` must be at least 1 is not directly affected by this print statement.

Output State: **`t` must be at least 1, `res` is its original value**
