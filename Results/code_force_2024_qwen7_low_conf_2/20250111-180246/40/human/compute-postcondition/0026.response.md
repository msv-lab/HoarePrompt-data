The code snippet appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, which means `result` remains unchanged after this operation. The list `results` now contains three elements, each being the value of `result`.

Output State: **`t` remains 1; `index` is 3 + 2*a0 + a1 + int(a2 + 2*a0 + a1); `n` remains int(a2 + 2*a0 + a1); `p` remains a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `data[index]` and ending at `data[index + n - 1]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is `[result, result, result, result]`.**
