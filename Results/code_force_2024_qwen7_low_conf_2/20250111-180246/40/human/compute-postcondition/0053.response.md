To adjust the states for the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initialization of `new_dp`:** The `new_dp` list is updated based on the previous `dp` values. Specifically, each element in `new_dp` is the sum of the corresponding elements in `dp` that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`.

2. **Loop Condition:** The loop runs from `i = 1` to `i = n`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `dp` is equal to `new_dp`.
- `new_dp` is a list of length `(2 * n + 1)` where each element is the sum of the corresponding `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`.

For the next iteration:
- The loop will increment `i` from its current value to `n`.
- Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`.

Since the loop starts from `i = 1` and increments `i` until it reaches `n`, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `2`.

The state remains unchanged regarding `new_dp` as it gets updated inside the loop. Thus, the `new_dp` list will be used again in the next iteration without being explicitly mentioned as changing.

So, the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `i` will be incremented by 1, making it 2.
- The `new_dp` list will remain the same as it is updated within the loop.

State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `new_dp` is a list of length (2 * n + 1) where each element is the sum of the corresponding `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2**
