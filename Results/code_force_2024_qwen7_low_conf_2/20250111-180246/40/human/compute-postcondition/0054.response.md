The code initializes `new_dp` as a list of length `(2 * n + 1)` filled with zeros. This means that every element in `new_dp` is now set to 0. The value of `dp` remains unchanged, and the value of `i` also remains unchanged.

Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `new_dp` is a list of length `(2 * n + 1)` where each element is 0, `i` is 2**
