According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop iterates over each element in `results`. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is at least 1, `res` is its original value, `results` must have at least one more element, and the value of `res` is printed.

To proceed to the next iteration, `results` must still have at least one more element. Since `res` is now one of the elements from `results`, for the loop to continue, `results` must have at least two more elements (one for the current iteration and one for the next).

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `results` has at least two more elements, and `res` takes on the value of the next element in `results`.

State: **`t` is at least 1, `res` is the next element in `results`, `results` must have at least two more elements**
