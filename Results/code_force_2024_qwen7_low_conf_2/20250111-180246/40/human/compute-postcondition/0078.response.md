Output State: **`dp` is a list of length (2 * n + 1), where each element `dp[j]` (with `0 ≤ j ≤ 2 * n`) is the sum of `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`, and `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State**:
   - `dp` is a list of length `2 * n + 1` with all elements initialized to `0`, except `dp[n]` which is `1`.
   - `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 5000`.
   - `p` is a list of `n` integers where `|pi| ≤ n` and `p` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `MOD` is an integer representing the modulo value `998,244,353`.
   - `offset` is equal to `n`.

2. **Loop Behavior**:
   - The outer loop runs `n` times, incrementing `i` from `1` to `n`.
   - For each iteration, a new list `new_dp` is created and initialized to `0`.
   - The inner loop updates `new_dp[j]` based on the values in `dp[j]` if `dp[j] > 0`. Specifically, `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` are incremented by `dp[j]` modulo `MOD`.

3. **After Loop Execution**:
   - After `n` iterations, the final state of `dp` will be the result of applying the update rules `n` times.
   - Each element `dp[j]` in the final list will be the sum of the corresponding `dp` elements that were greater than `0`, adjusted by modulo `MOD`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The loop ensures that each element in the `dp` list is updated based on its neighbors in the previous iteration, until no further updates are possible.
   - Since the loop runs `n` times and each update is applied modulo `MOD`, the final `dp` list will reflect the accumulated sums of relevant elements, respecting the constraints and the modulo operation.

Thus, the output state after all iterations of the loop is that `dp` is a list of length `(2 * n + 1)` where each element `dp[j]` is the sum of `dp` elements that were greater than `0`, adjusted by modulo `MOD`, and `n` remains within the specified range.
