The code updates the value of `new_dp[j - 1]` by adding `dp[j]` to its current value and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The initial state tells us that `new_dp[j + 1]` is equal to `dp[j] % MOD`. Since `j - 1 >= 0`, we can proceed with the calculation.

Given the initial conditions:
- `new_dp[j + 1]` is equal to `dp[j] % MOD`
- `i` is 2
- `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`
- `j - 1 >= 0`

The new value of `new_dp[j - 1]` will be:
\[ \text{new\_dp}[j - 1] = (\text{new\_dp}[j - 1] + \text{dp}[j]) \% \text{MOD} \]

Since the exact value of `new_dp[j - 1]` before this operation is not specified, let's denote it as `prev_new_dp[j - 1]`. After the operation, `new_dp[j - 1]` becomes:
\[ \text{new\_dp}[j - 1] = (\text{prev\_new\_dp}[j - 1] + \text{dp}[j]) \% \text{MOD} \]

The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated values are:
- `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated as above
- `new_dp[j + 1]` remains `dp[j] % MOD`
- `i` remains 2
- `j + 1` remains less than or equal to `2 * n`
- `j - 1` remains greater than or equal to 0

Output State: **`new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(prev_new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `new_dp[j + 1]` is equal to `dp[j] % MOD`, `i` is 2, `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, `j - 1` is greater than or equal to 0**
