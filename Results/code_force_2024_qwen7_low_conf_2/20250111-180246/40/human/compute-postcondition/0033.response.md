The code `print(res)` prints the value of `res`. The value of `res` is printed but no assignment is made, so the value of `res` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables (`t` and `results`) are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `res` is the next element in `results`, `results` must have at least two more elements, `res` is printed**
