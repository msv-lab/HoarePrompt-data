Postcondition: ***`dp[j]` is greater than 0. If `j - 1` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. If `j + 1` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Otherwise, there is no change to `new_dp[j + 1]`.***
