The code `index += 1` increments the value of `index` by 1. The initial value of `index` is 0, so after executing this line, `index` will be 1. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array `a`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `index` is 1**
