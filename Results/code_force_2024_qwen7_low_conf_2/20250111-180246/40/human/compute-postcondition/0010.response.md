`index` is incremented by `n`. The initial value of `index` is 1, and `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`. Therefore, the new value of `index` is `1 + data[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `index` is `1 + data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`**
