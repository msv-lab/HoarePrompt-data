`new_dp[j - 1]` is assigned the value of `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`. Given the initial conditions, `dp[j + 1]` is greater than 0, and if `j` is non-negative, `new_dp[j]` is updated according to certain conditions. However, the code snippet only updates `new_dp[j - 1]`.

Therefore, the output state includes the update to `new_dp[j - 1]` and retains the unchanged states of other variables.

Output State: **`dp[j + 1]` is greater than 0, if `j` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j]` is updated, and if `j + 2` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 2]` is updated, specifically if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`, `new_dp[j - 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`**.
