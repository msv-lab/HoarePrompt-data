The code initializes an empty list named `results`. This does not affect the values of the other variables (`t`, `n`, `p`, `data`, and `index`). Therefore, the only change is the creation of the `results` list.

Output State: **`t` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `n` is a positive integer indicating the size of the hidden array `a`, `p` is a list of `n` integers representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array `a`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input string, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
