Output State: **The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is p[-1] + offset and p[-1] is the last element of list p adjusted by offset, and dp is a list of length (2 * n + 1) where each element dp[j] (with 0 ≤ j ≤ 2 * n) is the sum of dp elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo MOD.**
