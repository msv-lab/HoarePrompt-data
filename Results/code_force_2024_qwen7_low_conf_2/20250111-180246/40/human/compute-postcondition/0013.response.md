According to the code, the loop iterates `t` times. The loop variable `_` is a dummy variable used to iterate `t` times. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `t` is at least 1 (which means `t >= 1`).
- `index` is `1 + data[0]`.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
- `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
- `results` is `[result]`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 1 (`t > 1`). Since `t` is at least 1, increasing it by 1 will make it greater than 1. All other variables will follow their respective logic for the next iteration.

Let's update the states accordingly:

- `t` will be incremented by 1, making it `t + 1` or `2` since it was at least 1.
- `index` will remain `1 + data[0]`.
- `n` will remain the integer value of `data[0]`.
- `p` will remain a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
- `result` will be the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for the new `n`.
- `results` will be updated to include this new result.

So, the updated states for the next iteration are:

State: **`t` is 2, `index` is `1 + data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is `[result, result]`**
