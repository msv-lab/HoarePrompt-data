The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of the variable `res`. This does not change the value of `res` or any other variable. The precondition that `t` must be at least 1 and `results` must have at least one more element remains unchanged. Therefore, the only thing that happens is the printing of the value of `res`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `res` is its original value, `results` must have at least one more element, and the value of `res` is printed.**
