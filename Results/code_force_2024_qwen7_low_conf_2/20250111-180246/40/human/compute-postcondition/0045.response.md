Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**: The initial state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `dp[j + 1]` is greater than 0, where `j` is non-negative.
   - `new_dp[j]` is updated.
   - If `j + 2` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 2]` is updated.
   - If `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 1]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.
   - `new_dp[j - 1]` is also updated to `(new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD`.

2. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop iterates over `j` from `0` to `2 * n`. The condition for the loop to continue is that `j` should be within the range `0` to `2 * n`.

3. **State Adjustment for Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, we know `dp[j + 1]` is greater than 0 and `j` is non-negative.
   - We also know that if `j + 1 <= 2 * n`, both `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]` are updated.
   - For the next iteration, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

4. **Next Iteration Analysis**:
   - The new value of `j` will be `j + 1`.
   - Since `j` was non-negative at the end of the previous iteration, `j + 1` will also be non-negative.
   - The condition `j + 1 <= 2 * n` will determine if the update rules apply to `new_dp[j + 1]` and `new_dp[j - 1]`.

5. **Updated States**:
   - `dp[j + 2]` becomes relevant because `j` is now `j + 1`.
   - `new_dp[j + 2]` will be updated if `j + 3` (which is `j + 2 + 1`) is less than or equal to `2 * n`.

6. **Final State for the Next Iteration**:
   - `dp[j + 2]` will be checked for being greater than 0.
   - If `j + 2 <= 2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 3]` will be updated.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`dp[j + 2]` is greater than 0, if `j + 1` is non-negative, then `new_dp[j + 2]` is updated, and if `j + 3` is less than or equal to `2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 3]` is updated. Specifically, if `j + 2 <= 2 * n`, then `new_dp[j + 3]` is updated to `(new_dp[j + 3] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD`, and `new_dp[j + 1]` is also updated to `(new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD`. No updates occur in the else case.**
