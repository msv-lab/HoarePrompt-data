Let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `t` is 2
   - `index` is `1 + data[0]`
   - `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`
   - `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
   - `results` is `[result, result]`

2. **Code Execution**:
   ```python
   n = int(data[index])
   ```

   - The value of `index` is `1 + data[0]`.
   - Therefore, `n` is assigned the integer value of `data[index]`, which is `data[1 + data[0]]`.

3. **Updated Variables**:
   - `t` remains 2.
   - `index` remains `1 + data[0]`.
   - `n` is updated to `int(data[1 + data[0]])`.
   - `p` remains the same as it is defined based on `data` and does not depend on `n` directly.
   - `result` remains unchanged as it is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` before `n` was reassigned.
   - `results` remains `[result, result]`.

4. **Output State**:
   - `t` is 2.
   - `index` is `1 + data[0]`.
   - `n` is `int(data[1 + data[0]])`.
   - `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`.
   - `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`.
   - `results` is `[result, result]`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is 2, `index` is `1 + data[0]`, `n` is `int(data[1 + data[0]])`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is `[result, result]`**.
