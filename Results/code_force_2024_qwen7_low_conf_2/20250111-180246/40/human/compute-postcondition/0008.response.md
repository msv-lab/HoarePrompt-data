`index` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `index` is 0, so it becomes 1. The states of the other variables (`t` and `n`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1, `index` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `index` is 1, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`**
