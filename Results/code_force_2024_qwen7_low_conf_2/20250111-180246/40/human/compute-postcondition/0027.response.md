Output State: **`t` is a non-negative integer, `index` is `t + data[0] * (t - 1)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[t]` for each iteration, `p` is a list of integers from `data[t + 1]` to `data[index - 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`**

### Explanation:
- **`t`**: Since `t` is used as the upper limit of the `range` function, it must be a non-negative integer.
- **`index`**: The value of `index` after the loop finishes is calculated as `t + data[0] * (t - 1)`. This is because each iteration increments `index` by `n + 1` where `n` is the value of `data[index - 1]`.
- **`n`**: For each iteration, `n` is set to the integer value of `data[index - 1]`.
- **`p`**: The list `p` is constructed from `data[index]` to `data[index + n - 1]` for each iteration.
- **`result`**: Each `result` is the return value of the function `func_1(n, p)` for the corresponding iteration.
- **`results`**: `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being the return value of `func_1(n, p)` from the respective iterations.

### Special Case (if the loop does not execute):
- If `t` is 0, then `index` remains `0`, `n` and `p` do not get updated, and `results` remains an empty list.

Thus, the final output state captures the behavior of the loop for any number of iterations and also handles the case when the loop does not execute.
