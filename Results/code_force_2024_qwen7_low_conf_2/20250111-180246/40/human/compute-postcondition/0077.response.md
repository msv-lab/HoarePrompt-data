The code `dp = new_dp` assigns the current value of `new_dp` to `dp`. This means that `dp` now holds the same values as `new_dp` after the updates were applied. The values of `new_dp[j - 1]` and `new_dp[j + 1]` for each `j` in the range `2 * n + 1` reflect the changes made based on the conditions specified.

Since the exact values of `new_dp` after the updates are not given, we know that `new_dp` was updated according to the conditions mentioned, but the specific values are not known. However, we can say that `dp` now has the same values as `new_dp`.

Output State: **`dp` is equal to `new_dp`, `new_dp[j - 1]` and `new_dp[j + 1]` are updated based on the condition `dp[j] > 0` for each `j` in the range `2 * n + 1`, `i` is 2, and the list `new_dp` is of length `2 * n + 1`.**
