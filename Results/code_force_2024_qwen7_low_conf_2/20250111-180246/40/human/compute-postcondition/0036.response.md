Functionality: **The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls another function `func_1` for each test case. For each test case, it extracts the number of test cases `t`, the size of the hidden array `n`, and a list of integers `p` representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array. It then calls `func_1(n, p)` to process these inputs and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results. Potential edge cases include handling empty input or invalid data formats. The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle cases where `t` is zero or negative. Additionally, the function does not validate the input for `p` beyond checking its length and ensuring it is sorted in non-decreasing order.**

**The final state of the program after the function concludes is as follows:**
- `t` is a non-negative integer representing the number of test cases.
- `index` is an integer representing the current position in the input data.
- `n` is the integer value of `data[t]` for each iteration.
- `p` is a list of integers from `data[t + 1]` to `data[index - 1]`.
- `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, with at least `t` elements.
- The program has printed the results for each test case.
