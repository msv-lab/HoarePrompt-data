The code `result = func_1(n, p)` assigns the return value of `func_1(n, p)` to the variable `result`. However, the function `func_1` and its implementation are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `result`. We know that `n` and `p` remain unchanged.

Let's summarize the changes:
- `result` is assigned the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, so `result` is now defined.
- `results` remains `[result, result, result]`.

The other variables (`t`, `index`, `n`, and `p`) remain in their initial states.

Output State: **`t` remains 1; `index` is 3 + 2*a0 + a1 + int(a2 + 2*a0 + a1); `n` remains int(a2 + 2*a0 + a1); `p` remains a list of integers extracted from `data` starting from `data[index]` and ending at `data[index + n - 1]`; `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` remains `[result, result, result]`.**
