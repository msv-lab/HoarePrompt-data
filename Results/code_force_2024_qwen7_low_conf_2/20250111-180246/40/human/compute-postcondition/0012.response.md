`result` is appended to the list `results`. The value of `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is at least 1, `index` is `1 + data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, and `results` is a list with one element, which is `result`.

Output State: **`t` is at least 1, `index` is `1 + data[0]`, `n` is the integer value of `data[0]`, `p` is a list of integers from `data[1]` to `data[index + n - 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`, `results` is [result]**
