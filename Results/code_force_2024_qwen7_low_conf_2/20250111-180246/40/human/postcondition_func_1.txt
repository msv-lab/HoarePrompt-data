The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls another function `func_1` for each test case. For each test case, it extracts the number of test cases `t`, the size of the hidden array `n`, and a list of integers `p` representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array. It then calls `func_1(n, p)` to process these inputs and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results. Potential edge cases include handling empty input or invalid data formats. The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle cases where `t` is zero or negative. Additionally, the function does not validate the input for `p` beyond checking its length and ensuring it is sorted in non-decreasing order.
