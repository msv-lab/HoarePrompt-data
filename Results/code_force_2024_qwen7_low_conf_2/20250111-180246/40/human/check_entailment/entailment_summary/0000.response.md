Reasoning: 
To determine if the given program is correct, we need to analyze whether both `func_1` and `func_2` together correctly solve the problem as described.

1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - **Purpose**: Computes a specific value derived from the input list `p` and the parameter `n` using dynamic programming (DP).
   - **Process**: 
     - Initializes a DP array `dp` of length `(2 * n + 1)` and sets the middle element to 1.
     - Iterates through the DP array, updating it based on the current and adjacent values, ensuring only positive values contribute to the new DP array.
     - Calculates `final_sum` as the last element of `p` adjusted by `n`.
     - Returns the value at index `final_sum` in the updated DP array, adjusted by the modulo value `MOD`.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - **Purpose**: Reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case.
   - **Process**: 
     - Reads the total number of test cases `t`.
     - For each test case, reads the size of the hidden array `n` and the list of integers `p` representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array.
     - Calls `func_1(n, p)` to process these inputs.
     - Stores the result in a list `results`.
     - Prints the results for all test cases.

### Analysis:
- **Dynamic Programming (`func_1`)**: The function `func_1` aims to compute the number of initial arrays `a` such that the sorted prefix sum array matches the given `p`. The logic seems sound for computing the number of ways to achieve a given prefix sum sequence after sorting, using a DP approach.
- **Input Handling (`func_2`)**: The function `func_2` reads the input correctly and processes each test case by calling `func_1`. It handles multiple test cases and prints the results modulo `998244353`.

### Conclusion:
Both `func_1` and `func_2` together appear to correctly implement the solution to the problem. `func_1` correctly computes the required value using dynamic programming, and `func_2` correctly processes the input and outputs the results as specified.

Correctness: **True**
