Reasoning:
1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires us to determine the number of possible initial arrays \(a\) (consisting of 1s and -1s) that can produce a given sorted prefix sum array \(p\).
2. **Function Analysis**:
   - **Function `func_1`**: This function computes the number of ways to generate the prefix sums given the sorted array \(p\). It uses dynamic programming to keep track of the counts of prefix sums that can be achieved. The logic behind the dynamic programming approach is correct because it iteratively builds up the possible prefix sums and ensures that the result respects the modulo constraint.
   - **Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input, processes multiple test cases, and calls `func_1` for each test case. The logic to read input, extract necessary parameters, and call `func_1` is correct. The use of dynamic input reading via `sys.stdin.read()` is efficient for handling large inputs, and the overall structure handles the multiple test cases correctly.

3. **Edge Cases and Constraints**:
   - The solution correctly handles the constraints: \(1 \leq n \leq 5000\) and the sum of \(n\) over all test cases does not exceed 5000.
   - The function respects the modulo operation throughout, ensuring that intermediate and final results stay within the specified bounds.
   - The function correctly handles the input format and processes it as expected.

Given the analysis, the provided code correctly implements the logic to solve the problem and handles all specified constraints and edge cases appropriately.

Correctness: **True**
