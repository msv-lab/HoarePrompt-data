You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function and its usage within `func_2` do not accurately model the generation and sorting of prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to simulate the process of generating prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s and checking if the given sorted prefix sums can be derived.
   - However, the approach used in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the possible transitions between prefix sums. It uses dynamic programming to generate all possible prefix sums, but it does not account for the specific transitions that can occur (i.e., adding 1 or subtracting 1 to the previous prefix sum).
   - For example, consider the input `[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`. The correct array `a` could be `[1, -1, 1, -1, -1]`, leading to the prefix sums `[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` before sorting. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle such transitions.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Transitions**:
   - The function iterates through all possible prefix sums and updates the DP table, but it does not properly account for the constraints that the prefix sums must be non-decreasing and can only change by ±1.
   - This leads to incorrect counts for certain inputs. For instance, the example given in the problem statement for `n=5` and `p=[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` has three valid solutions, but the function incorrectly returns 1.

3. **Example Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input `n=5` and `p=[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`. The function should return 3, but it returns 1, indicating a flaw in the logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to handle certain cases appropriately, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
