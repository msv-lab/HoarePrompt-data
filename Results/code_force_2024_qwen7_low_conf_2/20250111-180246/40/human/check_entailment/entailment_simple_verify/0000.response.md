### Reasoning:

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program indeed does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Here are the key points supporting this conclusion:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` attempts to simulate the process of generating prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s, but it does not correctly model the transitions between these prefix sums.
   - The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` generates all possible prefix sums without considering the constraints that the prefix sums must be non-decreasing and can only change by ±1. This leads to incorrect counts for certain inputs.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Transitions**:
   - The function iterates through all possible prefix sums and updates the DP table, but it does not properly account for the constraints. Specifically, it does not ensure that the generated prefix sums are non-decreasing and that the changes are only ±1.
   - For example, the input `[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` corresponds to the array `[1, -1, 1, -1, -1]` or other similar combinations. The function `func_1` does not handle these transitions correctly, leading to incorrect results.

3. **Example Counterexample**:
   - The example given in the problem statement for `n=5` and `p=[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` has three valid solutions, but the function incorrectly returns 1. This clearly demonstrates a flaw in the logic of the function.

Given these issues, the program is **incorrect**.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is not correct based on the detailed analysis and the provided counterexample.
