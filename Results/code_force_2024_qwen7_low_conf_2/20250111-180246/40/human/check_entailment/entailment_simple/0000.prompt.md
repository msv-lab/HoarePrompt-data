You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is a hidden array a of size n consisting of only 1 and -1 . Let p be the
prefix sums of array a . More formally, p is an array of length n defined as
p_i = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_i . Afterwards, array p is sorted in non-
decreasing order. For example, if a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] , then p = [1, 0, -1,
0, 1] before sorting and p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] after sorting.

You are given the prefix sum array p after sorting, but you do not know what
array a is. Your task is to count the number of initial arrays a such that the
above process results in the given sorted prefix sum array p . As this number
can be large, you are only required to find it modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \leq t \leq 1000 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 5000
) — the size of the hidden array a .

The second line of each test case contains n integers p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n
(|p_i| \le n ) — the n prefix sums of a sorted in non-decreasing order.

It is guaranteed that p_1 \le p_2 \le \ldots \le p_n .

It is guaranteed that the sum of n over all test cases does not exceed 5000 .

Output

For each test case, output the answer modulo 998\,244\,353 .

Note

In the first two test cases, the only possible arrays a for n = 1 are a = [1]
and a = [-1] . Their respective sorted prefix sum arrays p are p = [1] and p =
[-1] . Hence, there is no array a that can result in the sorted prefix sum
array p = [0] and there is exactly 1 array a that can result in the sorted
prefix sum array p = [1] .

In the third test case, it can be proven that there is no array a that could
result in the sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 1, 2] .

In the fourth test case, the 3 possible arrays a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] are:

  * a = [1, -1, 1, -1, -1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, 1, 0, -1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [1, -1, -1, 1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [1, 0, -1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 
  * a = [-1, 1, 1, -1, 1] . The prefix sum array before sorting is p = [-1, 0, 1, 0, 1] , which after sorting gives p = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1] . 

For the fifth test case, the only possible array a that could result in the
sorted prefix sum array p = [-4, -3, -3, -2, -1] is a = [-1, -1, -1, -1, 1] .
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
MOD = 998244353
if __name__ == '__main__':
    func_2()

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, p is a list of n integers where |pi| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order. The variable MOD is an integer representing the modulo value 998,244,353.
def func_1(n, p):
    dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
        
        for j in range(2 * n + 1):
            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
                if j - 1 >= 0:
                    new_dp[j - 1] = (new_dp[j - 1] + dp[j]) % MOD
        
        dp = new_dp
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list of length (2 * n + 1), where each element `dp[j]` (with `0 ≤ j ≤ 2 * n`) is the sum of `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`, and `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is p[-1] + offset and p[-1] is the last element of list p adjusted by offset, and dp is a list of length (2 * n + 1) where each element dp[j] (with 0 ≤ j ≤ 2 * n) is the sum of dp elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo MOD.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases; n is a positive integer indicating the size of the hidden array a; p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a, where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_2():
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    index = 0
    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n
        
        result = func_1(n, p)
        
        results.append(result)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `index` is `t + data[0] * (t - 1)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[t]` for each iteration, `p` is a list of integers from `data[t + 1]` to `data[index - 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `res` is the last printed element from the `results` list, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `results` must have at least `t` elements.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
