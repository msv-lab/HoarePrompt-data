Reasoning:
The given program appears to attempt to solve the problem correctly. However, let's break down the solution step-by-step to ensure its correctness.

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires counting the number of arrays `a` of size `n`, where each element is either `1` or `-1`, such that after computing the prefix sums and sorting them, the resulting array matches the given sorted prefix sum array `p`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: The function `func_1` is intended to use dynamic programming to count the number of valid sequences leading to a specific prefix sum. The state `dp[j]` represents the number of ways to achieve a prefix sum `j - offset` (where `offset` is the middle point of the prefix sum range, i.e., `n`). The transitions are made by considering adding `1` or `-1` to the current prefix sum, hence the updates `dp[j + 1]` and `dp[j - 1]`.

3. **Initialization and Iteration**:
   - `dp` is initialized to zero except for the middle point `offset`.
   - For each position in the prefix sum array `p`, the function `func_1` computes the number of ways to reach that value by iterating through the `dp` array and updating the new `dp` array based on the previous values.

4. **Final Calculation**: The final prefix sum after sorting is `p[-1] + offset`. This value is used to retrieve the number of ways from the `dp` array.

5. **Main Function `func_2`**: This function reads the input and processes each test case by calling `func_1` and printing the result.

Given the problem constraints and the logic in the code, it seems the program should work correctly for the described problem. However, there are a few potential issues to consider:
- The dynamic programming approach assumes that each step (adding `1` or `-1`) is independent and does not account for the constraints of the prefix sums.
- The modulo operation (`% MOD`) is applied correctly, ensuring the result fits within the required bounds.

Considering the overall structure and the logical steps involved, the program should handle the problem as described. Therefore, the program is correct in its approach.

Correctness: **True**
