Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to solve the problem. Specifically, the `func_1` function and its usage within `func_2` do not accurately model the generation and sorting of prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s.

### Detailed Analysis:

1. **Incorrect Logic in `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` is intended to simulate the process of generating prefix sums from an array of 1s and -1s and checking if the given sorted prefix sums can be derived.
   - However, the approach used in `func_1` does not correctly simulate the possible transitions between prefix sums. It uses dynamic programming to generate all possible prefix sums, but it does not account for the specific transitions that can occur (i.e., adding 1 or subtracting 1 to the previous prefix sum).
   - For example, consider the input `[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`. The correct array `a` could be `[1, -1, 1, -1, -1]`, leading to the prefix sums `[1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` before sorting. The function `func_1` does not correctly handle such transitions.

2. **Incorrect Handling of Transitions**:
   - The function iterates through all possible prefix sums and updates the DP table, but it does not properly account for the constraints that the prefix sums must be non-decreasing and can only change by Â±1.
   - This leads to incorrect counts for certain inputs. For instance, the example given in the problem statement for `n=5` and `p=[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]` has three valid solutions, but the function incorrectly returns 1.

3. **Example Counterexample**:
   - Consider the input `n=5` and `p=[-1, 0, 0, 1, 1]`. The function should return 3, but it returns 1, indicating a flaw in the logic.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly implement the required logic and fails to handle certain cases appropriately, leading to incorrect results. Therefore, the program is **incorrect**.
