#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000, p is a list of n integers where |pi| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order. The variable MOD is an integer representing the modulo value 998,244,353.

    offset = n
    dp[offset] = 1
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        new_dp = [0] * (2 * n + 1)

            if dp[j] > 0:
                if j + 1 <= 2 * n:
                    new_dp[j + 1] = (new_dp[j + 1] + dp[j]) % MOD

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `dp` is a list of length (2 * n + 1), where each element `dp[j]` (with `0 ≤ j ≤ 2 * n`) is the sum of `dp` elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo `MOD`, and `n` is within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000.
    final_sum = p[-1] + offset
    return dp[final_sum]
    #The program returns dp[final_sum], where final_sum is p[-1] + offset and p[-1] is the last element of list p adjusted by offset, and dp is a list of length (2 * n + 1) where each element dp[j] (with 0 ≤ j ≤ 2 * n) is the sum of dp elements that were greater than 0, adjusted by modulo MOD.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` (an integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 5000) and `p` (a sorted list of integers where |pi| ≤ n). It initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` of length (2 * n + 1) and sets the middle element to 1. It then iterates through the DP array, updating it based on the current and adjacent values, ensuring that only positive values contribute to the new DP array. After the loop, it calculates `final_sum` as the last element of `p` adjusted by `offset` (which is equal to `n`). Finally, it returns the value at index `final_sum` in the updated DP array, adjusted by the modulo value `MOD`. This process effectively computes a specific value derived from the input list `p` and the parameter `n`, ensuring all intermediate results respect the modulo constraint. Potential edge cases include the smallest and largest possible values of `n` and the empty list scenario for `p`, though the latter is not explicitly handled in the code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer indicating the number of test cases; n is a positive integer indicating the size of the hidden array a; p is a list of n integers representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array a, where |p_i| ≤ n and p is sorted in non-decreasing order.
def func_2():

    t = int(data[index])
    index += 1
    results = []
    for _ in range(t):
        n = int(data[index])
        
        index += 1
        
        p = list(map(int, data[index:index + n]))
        
        index += n

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `index` is `t + data[0] * (t - 1)`, `n` is the integer value of `data[t]` for each iteration, `p` is a list of integers from `data[t + 1]` to `data[index - 1]`, `result` is the return value of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `results` is a list containing `t` elements where each element is the return value of `func_1(n, p)`
    for res in results:
        print(res)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is a non-negative integer, `res` is the last printed element from the `results` list, `results` is a list containing the return values of `func_1(n, p)` for each iteration, `results` must have at least `t` elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` reads input from standard input, processes multiple test cases, and calls another function `func_1` for each test case. For each test case, it extracts the number of test cases `t`, the size of the hidden array `n`, and a list of integers `p` representing the sorted prefix sums of the hidden array. It then calls `func_1(n, p)` to process these inputs and stores the result in a list `results`. After processing all test cases, it prints the results. Potential edge cases include handling empty input or invalid data formats. The function assumes that the input is correctly formatted and does not handle cases where `t` is zero or negative. Additionally, the function does not validate the input for `p` beyond checking its length and ensuring it is sorted in non-decreasing order.
