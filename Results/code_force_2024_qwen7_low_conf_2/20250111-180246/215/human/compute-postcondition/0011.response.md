Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer. If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, the output of the program is `n * a`. If `b` is greater than `a`, the printed value is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`; otherwise, the printed value is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.***
