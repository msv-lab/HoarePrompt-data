`t` is decremented by 1 and assigned the new value, `n` is an integer input from the user, `a` is an integer input from the user, and `b` is an integer input from the user. The code calculates the value of the expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` and prints it. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated with their new values.

Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`, `n` is an integer input from the user, `a` is an integer input from the user, `b` is an integer input from the user, and the output of the expression `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n` is printed.**
