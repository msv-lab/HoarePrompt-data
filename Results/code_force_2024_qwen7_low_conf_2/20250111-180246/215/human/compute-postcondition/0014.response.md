The code snippet prints the product of `n` and `a`. The values of `n` and `a` are taken as inputs from the user. After executing the code, `n` and `a` retain their input values, while the value of `t` remains unchanged as it was not used in the code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the input line; `a` is the second integer from the input line; the product of `n` and `a` is printed.**
