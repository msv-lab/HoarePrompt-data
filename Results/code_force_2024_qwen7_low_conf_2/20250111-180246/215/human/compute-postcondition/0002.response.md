The code splits the input into three integers and assigns them to variables `n`, `a`, and `b`. The initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, but this variable is not affected by the code snippet provided. Therefore, the output state includes the updated values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, while the precondition regarding `t` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer**
