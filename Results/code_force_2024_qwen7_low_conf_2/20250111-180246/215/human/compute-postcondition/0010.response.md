Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `b` is greater than `a`. If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the printed value is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`. Otherwise, the printed value is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.***
