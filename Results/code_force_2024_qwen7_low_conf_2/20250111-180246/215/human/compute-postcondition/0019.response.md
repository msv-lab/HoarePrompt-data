Let's break down the problem step by step to determine the necessary adjustments for the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0.
- `n` is the first integer from the input line.
- `a` is the second integer from the input line.
- `b` is the third integer from the input line.
- If `b <= a`, the product of `n` and `a` is printed. Otherwise, if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output is \((2 * b - n + 1) * \frac{n}{2}\). Otherwise, the output is the integer result of `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

### For Loop Statement:
```
for _ in range(t):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. **Loop Execution Condition**: The loop runs `t` times. Since `t` is an integer input and must be greater than 0, it means the loop will run until `t` iterations are completed.

2. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - We have processed one iteration of the loop.
   - The remaining number of iterations left to process is `t - 1`.

3. **Next Iteration Preparation**:
   - We need to prepare the state for the next iteration.
   - The loop variable `_` is a placeholder and does not hold any value, but we still need to decrement the remaining iterations count.

### Adjusted State at the Start of the Next Iteration:
- `t` remains unchanged because it represents the total number of iterations and is decremented within the loop itself.
- `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged as they are specific to each input set and do not change with each iteration.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:

**State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the input line; `a` is the second integer from the input line; `b` is the third integer from the input line; `t` is now `t - 1`**
