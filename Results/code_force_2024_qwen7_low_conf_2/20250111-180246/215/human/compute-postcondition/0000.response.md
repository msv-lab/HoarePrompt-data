`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which means `t` is now an integer input from the user. The other preconditions (each test case consisting of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user, each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9**
