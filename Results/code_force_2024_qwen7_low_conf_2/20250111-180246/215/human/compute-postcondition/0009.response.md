The code calculates and prints the value of the expression `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. The variables `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code, so their values remain unchanged. The value of `b - a` is an integer, and since `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the expression is well-defined.

Let's denote `d = b - a`. Given that `d` is an integer and `d < n`, the expression simplifies to:

\[ \text{value} = \text{int}\left(\frac{d}{2} \cdot (d + 1) + a \cdot n\right) \]

This expression does not assign its result to any variable, but rather prints it. After executing the code, the value of the expression is printed, but none of the variables `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b` are updated.

Output State: **`t` is an integer and greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `b` is greater than `a`. The difference between `b` and `a` is less than `n`. A value corresponding to `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` is printed.**
