Postcondition: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the input line; `a` is the second integer from the input line; `b` is the third integer from the input line; if `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, the output is \(\left(2 * b - n + 1\right) * \frac{n}{2}\). Otherwise, the output is the integer result of `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`**
