According to the code, the loop will execute based on the value of `t`. The variable `t` represents the number of test cases, and for the loop to execute, `t` must be at least 1. Since `t` is an integer input from the user, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. The loop `for _ in range(t):` will iterate `t` times.
2. For the loop to execute, `t` must be a positive integer and at least 1.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state such that `t` is greater than or equal to 1.

State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1**
