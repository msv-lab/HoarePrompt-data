The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the problem statement, it seems the function is expected to process a set of test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers: `n`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\). The function does not return anything directly from its body but processes these test cases.

Given the provided information, the function should handle a series of test cases, each containing three integers, and perform some operation or return a value based on these integers. Since the specific operation is not detailed here, we can only describe the inputs and outputs as per the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\), and returns a value or performs an operation based on these integers.**
