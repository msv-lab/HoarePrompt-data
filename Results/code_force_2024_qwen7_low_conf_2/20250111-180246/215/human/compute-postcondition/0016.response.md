The code calculates the expression `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)` using the values of `a`, `b`, and `n`. It does not modify the values of `a`, `b`, or `n`; instead, it prints the result of the expression. The output is an integer due to the `int()` function. 

Since the code only prints the result and does not assign it back to a variable, the values of `a`, `b`, and `n` remain unchanged. The initial state of `t` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the input line; `a` is the second integer from the input line; `b` is the third integer from the input line; the output is the integer result of `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`**
