The code calculates and prints the value of `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`. This expression is evaluated using the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` from the initial state. The values of `t`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged, while `n` is used in the calculation. The output of the print statement is the result of the expression.

Let's denote the specific values as follows:
- `n` is the first integer input from the user.
- `a` is the second integer input from the user.
- `b` is the third integer input from the user.

The expression evaluates to:
\[ \text{result} = \left(2 * b - n + 1\right) * \frac{n}{2} \]

This value is printed, but none of the variables `t`, `a`, or `b` are altered by this code. Therefore, their values remain the same.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the input line; `a` is the second integer from the input line; `b` is the third integer from the input line; the output is \(\left(2 * b - n + 1\right) * \frac{n}{2}\)**
