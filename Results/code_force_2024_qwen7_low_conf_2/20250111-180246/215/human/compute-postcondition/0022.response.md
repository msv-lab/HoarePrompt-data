`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0, `n` is the new integer from the user's input, `a` is the new integer from the user's input, `b` is the new integer from the user's input, `t` is now `t - 1`. The code prints the value of the expression `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.

Let's break down the expression:

1. `2 * b - n + 1`: This expression involves multiplying `b` by 2, subtracting `n`, and adding 1.
2. The result of the above expression is then multiplied by `n`.
3. Finally, the entire result is divided by 2.

Since `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` are updated or used in the expression, their values are taken as they are in the current state. The output of the print statement is the result of the expression.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer from the user's input, `a` is an integer from the user's input, `b` is an integer from the user's input, and the output is the value of `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.**
