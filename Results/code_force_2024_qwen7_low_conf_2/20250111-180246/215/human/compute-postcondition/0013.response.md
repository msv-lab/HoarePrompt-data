The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes a single line of input from the user, splits it into three parts, and converts each part into an integer before assigning them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0, this input is not used in the current code snippet. The values of `t`, `n`, `a`, and `b` are updated as follows:

- `t` is still an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0 (unchanged).
- `n` is assigned the first integer from the input line.
- `a` is assigned the second integer from the input line.
- `b` is assigned the third integer from the input line.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the input line; `a` is the second integer from the input line; `b` is the third integer from the input line.**
