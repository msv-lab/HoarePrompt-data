`n` and `a` are used in the multiplication operation, and the result is printed. The value of `t` is updated to `t - 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `t` are changed accordingly, while the output of the multiplication is shown. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is now `t - 1`; `n` is the new integer from the user's input; `a` is the new integer from the user's input; the output is `n * a`.

Output State: **`t` is now `t - 1`; `n` is the new integer from the user's input; `a` is the new integer from the user's input; the output is `n * a`**
