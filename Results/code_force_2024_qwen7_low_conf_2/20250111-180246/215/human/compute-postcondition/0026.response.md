Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1. After all iterations of the loop, the following conditions hold for the variables: For each iteration, if `b <= a`, the output is `n * a`. If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the output is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`. If `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the output is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.**

This output state describes the final state of the variables after all iterations of the loop have finished executing, based on the given conditions within the loop.
