The code `n, a, b = map(int, input().split())` takes three integers from the user input and assigns them to `n`, `a`, and `b` respectively. The initial state is that `t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0; `n` is the first integer from the input line; `a` is the second integer from the input line; `b` is the third integer from the input line; and `t` is now `t - 1`. After executing the code, the values of `n`, `a`, and `b` will be updated to the new integers provided by the user, and `t` will be decremented by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than 0, `n` is the new integer from the user's input, `a` is the new integer from the user's input, `b` is the new integer from the user's input, `t` is now `t - 1`**
