Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\). It reads `t` test cases from the user, where `1 \leq t \leq 10^4`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given conditions:

1. If `b <= a`, it prints `n * a`.
2. If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, it prints \(\frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2}\).
3. If `b > a` and `b - a < n`, it prints \(\text{int}(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n)\).

After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the calculated values for each test case. The function handles all possible cases as defined in the conditions and includes the necessary calculations for each scenario.**

This summary covers all the conditions specified in the code and ensures that all potential cases are included in the functionality description.
