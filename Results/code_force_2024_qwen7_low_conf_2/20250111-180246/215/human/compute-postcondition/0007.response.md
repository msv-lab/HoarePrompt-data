The code snippet calculates a value using the formula `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2` and prints it. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `n`, `a`, or `b`; it only uses their values to compute and print the result.

Given the initial conditions:
- `t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1.
- `n` is an integer.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer, and `b` is greater than `a`.
- The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`.

The output of the calculation is printed, but none of the variables are updated. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except that the calculated value is printed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer, `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, and `b` is greater than `a`. The difference between `b` and `a` is greater than or equal to `n`. The printed value is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`.**
