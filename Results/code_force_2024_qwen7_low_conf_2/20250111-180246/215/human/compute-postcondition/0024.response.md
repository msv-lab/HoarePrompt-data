Postcondition: ***`t` is `t - 1`, `n` is an integer from the user's input, `a` is an integer from the user's input, `b` is an integer from the user's input. If `b - a >= n`, the output is the value of `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`. Otherwise, the output is the value of `(b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n`.***
