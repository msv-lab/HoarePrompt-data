Reasoning:
1. The function correctly reads the number of test cases, `t`, from the input.
2. It then iterates over each test case, reading the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`.
3. The function checks the conditions for `b` relative to `a` and calculates the maximum profit according to the given rules:
   - If `b <= a`, it calculates the profit as `n * a`, which is straightforward.
   - If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, it uses the formula \(\frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2}\), which is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series and correctly calculates the profit for this scenario.
   - If `b > a` and `b - a < n`, it uses the formula \(\text{int}(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n)\), which also correctly calculates the profit for this scenario.
4. The function outputs the calculated profit for each test case and does not return any value, as required by the problem statement.

Given the logic and the implementation of the function, it accurately follows the problem description and handles all the specified cases.

Correctness: **True**
