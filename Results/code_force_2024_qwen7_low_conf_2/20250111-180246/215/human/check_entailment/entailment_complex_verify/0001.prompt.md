You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and an annotated version of the code. The annotations describe the program's state at key points.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the original assessment. Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the annotated version to systematically evaluate the program’s behavior and reasoning. Use the annotations to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.

- Problem description: 
Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.

- Program: 
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))



- Annotated Code: 
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1. After all iterations of the loop, the following conditions hold for the variables: For each iteration, if `b <= a`, the output is `n * a`. If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the output is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`. If `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the output is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases, where each test case consists of three positive integers `n`, `a`, and `b` such that \(1 \leq n, a, b \leq 10^9\). It reads `t` test cases from the user, where `1 \leq t \leq 10^4`. For each test case, it calculates and prints a value based on the given conditions:

1. If `b <= a`, it prints `n * a`.
2. If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, it prints \(\frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2}\).
3. If `b > a` and `b - a < n`, it prints \(\text{int}(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n)\).

After processing all test cases, the function does not return any value but prints the calculated values for each test case. The function handles all possible cases as defined in the conditions and includes the necessary calculations for each scenario.


Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and examples provided.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` buns with a usual price of `a` coins each.
   - We can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) such that the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The modified price of the `i-th` (1 ≤ i ≤ k) bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit, which is calculated as the total revenue from selling all buns minus the cost (which is zero in this context).

2. **Analyzing the Program Logic:**
   - The program takes an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It uses an `if-elif-else` structure to handle different conditions:
     - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price gives the maximum profit.
     - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it calculates the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This formula is derived from summing up the arithmetic series of the modified prices for the first `k` buns, where `k` equals `n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This formula is derived from summing up the modified prices for the first `k` buns and adding the usual price for the remaining `n-k` buns, where `k` is the integer value that maximizes the profit within the given constraints.

3. **Verifying the Correctness:**
   - The logic handles all edge cases correctly, such as when `b` is less than or equal to `a` or when `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - The formulas used for calculating the profit are mathematically sound and match the problem's requirements.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the provided problem description and examples.
