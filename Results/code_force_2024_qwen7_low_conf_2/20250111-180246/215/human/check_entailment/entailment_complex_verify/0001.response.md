### Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze its logic step-by-step against the problem description and the provided examples.

#### 1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` buns with a usual price of `a` coins each.
   - We can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) such that the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The modified price of the `i-th` (1 ≤ i ≤ k) bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit, which is calculated as the total revenue from selling all buns minus the cost (which is zero in this context).

#### 2. **Analyzing the Program Logic:**
   - The program takes an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It uses an `if-elif-else` structure to handle different conditions:
     - **Case 1: `b <= a`**
       - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price gives the maximum profit.
     - **Case 2: `b - a >= n`**
       - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it calculates the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This formula is derived from summing up the arithmetic series of the modified prices for the first `k` buns, where `k` equals `n`.
     - **Case 3: `b - a < n`**
       - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This formula is derived from summing up the modified prices for the first `k` buns and adding the usual price for the remaining `n-k` buns, where `k` is the integer value that maximizes the profit within the given constraints.

#### 3. **Verifying the Correctness:**
   - Let's verify the logic using the provided examples:
     - **Example 1:** `4 4 5`
       - Here, `b = 5`, `a = 4`, and `n = 4`.
       - Since `b > a`, we check `b - a = 1` and compare it with `n = 4`. Since `1 < 4`, we use the third case.
       - The formula becomes `int((5 - 4) / 2 * (5 - 4 + 1) + 4 * 4) = int(1 / 2 * 2 + 16) = int(1 + 16) = 17`.
       - The program correctly outputs `17`.
     - **Example 2:** `5 5 9`
       - Here, `b = 9`, `a = 5`, and `n = 5`.
       - Since `b > a`, we check `b - a = 4` and compare it with `n = 5`. Since `4 < 5`, we use the third case.
       - The formula becomes `int((9 - 5) / 2 * (9 - 5 + 1) + 5 * 5) = int(4 / 2 * 5 + 25) = int(10 + 25) = 35`.
       - The program correctly outputs `35`.
     - **Example 3:** `10 10 5`
       - Here, `b = 5`, `a = 10`, and `n = 10`.
       - Since `b < a`, we use the first case.
       - The formula becomes `10 * 10 = 100`.
       - The program correctly outputs `100`.

From these examples, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The formulas used in the program are mathematically sound and match the problem's requirements.

#### 4. **Conclusion:**
   - The program correctly handles all possible scenarios as defined in the problem statement.
   - The logic is sound and the formulas are correctly implemented.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the provided problem description and examples.
