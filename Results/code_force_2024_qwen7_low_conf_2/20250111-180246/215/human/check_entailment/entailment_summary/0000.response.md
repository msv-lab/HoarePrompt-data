Reasoning:
To verify the correctness of the program, we need to ensure that it correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles all the given conditions accurately.

1. **Condition Check**: The program correctly checks the condition `b <= a` and prints `n * a` when this condition is met. This is correct because if the modified price is less than or equal to the usual price, there's no benefit in changing the prices, and selling all buns at the usual price is the best strategy.

2. **Condition Check for Large `b - a`**: The program also correctly checks the condition `b - a >= n` and prints \(\frac{(2 * b - n + 1) * n}{2}\). This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series and correctly represents the total profit when the modified price is significantly higher than the usual price, leading to the sale of the first `k` buns at progressively lower prices.

3. **Condition Check for Small `b - a`**: The program correctly checks the condition `b - a < n` and prints \(\text{int}(\frac{(b - a) * (b - a + 1)}{2} + a * n)\). This formula accounts for the profit from the first `k` buns sold at progressively lower prices and the remaining `n - k` buns sold at the usual price.

Given these checks and the corresponding formulas, the program should correctly determine the maximum profit for each test case based on the given conditions.

Therefore, the program appears to be correctly implementing the logic described in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
