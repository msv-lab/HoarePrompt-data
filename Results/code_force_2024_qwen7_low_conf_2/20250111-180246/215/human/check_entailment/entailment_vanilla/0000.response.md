Reasoning:

To determine the correctness of the given program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and examples provided.

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have `n` buns with a usual price of `a` coins each.
   - We can choose an integer `k` (0 ≤ k ≤ min(n, b)) such that the first `k` buns are sold at a modified price, and the remaining `n-k` buns are sold at the usual price.
   - The modified price of the `i-th` (1 ≤ i ≤ k) bun is `(b - i + 1)` coins.
   - The goal is to maximize the profit, which is calculated as the total revenue from selling all buns minus the cost (which is zero in this context).

2. **Analyzing the Program Logic:**
   - The program takes an integer `t` indicating the number of test cases.
   - For each test case, it reads `n`, `a`, and `b`.
   - It uses an `if-elif-else` structure to handle different conditions:
     - If `b` is less than or equal to `a`, it prints `n * a` because selling all buns at the usual price gives the maximum profit.
     - If `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`, it calculates the profit using the formula `int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2)`. This formula is derived from summing up the arithmetic series of the modified prices for the first `k` buns, where `k` equals `n`.
     - Otherwise, it calculates the profit using the formula `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`. This formula is derived from summing up the modified prices for the first `k` buns and adding the usual price for the remaining `n-k` buns, where `k` is the integer value that maximizes the profit within the given constraints.

3. **Verifying the Correctness:**
   - The logic handles all edge cases correctly, such as when `b` is less than or equal to `a` or when `b - a` is greater than or equal to `n`.
   - The formulas used for calculating the profit are mathematically sound and match the problem's requirements.

Given the analysis, the program appears to correctly implement the solution based on the provided problem description and examples.

Correctness: **True**
