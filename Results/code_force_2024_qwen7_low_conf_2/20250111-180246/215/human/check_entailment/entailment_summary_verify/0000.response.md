### Reasoning:

Let's carefully analyze the given problem and the provided program to verify its correctness.

#### Problem Description Recap:
- Bob has \( n \) buns.
- The usual price of a bun is \( a \) coins.
- Bob can choose an integer \( k \) (where \( 0 \le k \le \min(n, b) \)) to sell the first \( k \) buns at a modified price \( b - i + 1 \) for the \( i \)-th bun.
- The remaining \( n - k \) buns are sold at the usual price \( a \).

The goal is to find the maximum profit Bob can make.

#### Program Analysis:
The program is structured to handle different cases based on the values of \( b \) and \( n \):

1. **Case 1:** \( b \le a \)
   - The program directly prints \( n \times a \).
   - This is correct because selling all buns at the usual price \( a \) is the best option when \( b \le a \).

2. **Case 2:** \( b > a \) and \( b - a \ge n \)
   - The program prints \(\frac{(2 \times b - n + 1) \times n}{2}\).
   - This formula is derived from the sum of an arithmetic series where the first term is \( b \) and the last term is \( b - n + 1 \).

3. **Case 3:** \( b > a \) and \( b - a < n \)
   - The program prints \(\text{int}(\frac{(b - a) \times (b - a + 1)}{2} + a \times n)\).
   - This formula calculates the sum of the first \( b - a \) terms of an arithmetic series starting from \( b \) and adds the cost of selling the remaining \( n - (b - a) \) buns at the usual price \( a \).

Let's verify these cases with the examples provided in the problem statement:

1. **Example 1: \( n = 4 \), \( a = 4 \), \( b = 5 \)**
   - Since \( b > a \), we check if \( b - a = 1 \ge 4 \), which is false.
   - We fall into Case 3: \( b - a = 1 < 4 \).
   - Calculate: \(\text{int}(\frac{1 \times 2}{2} + 4 \times 4) = \text{int}(1 + 16) = 17\).
   - This matches the expected output.

2. **Example 2: \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 9 \)**
   - Since \( b > a \), we check if \( b - a = 4 \ge 5 \), which is false.
   - We fall into Case 3: \( b - a = 4 < 5 \).
   - Calculate: \(\text{int}(\frac{4 \times 5}{2} + 5 \times 5) = \text{int}(10 + 25) = 35\).
   - This matches the expected output.

3. **Example 3: \( n = 10 \), \( a = 10 \), \( b = 5 \)**
   - Since \( b \le a \), we fall into Case 1: \( n \times a = 10 \times 10 = 100 \).
   - This matches the expected output.

4. **Example 4: \( n = 5 \), \( a = 5 \), \( b = 11 \)**
   - Since \( b > a \), we check if \( b - a = 6 \ge 5 \), which is true.
   - We fall into Case 2: \( b - a = 6 \ge 5 \).
   - Calculate: \(\frac{(2 \times 11 - 5 + 1) \times 5}{2} = \frac{23 \times 5}{2} = 57.5 \rightarrow 57\) (integer part).
   - This matches the expected output.

5. **Example 5: Large values (\( n = 10^9 \), \( a = 10^9 \), \( b = 10^9 \))**
   - Since \( b = a \), we fall into Case 1: \( n \times a = 10^9 \times 10^9 = 10^{18} \).
   - This matches the expected output.

6. **Example 6: Large values (\( n = 10^9 \), \( a = 10^9 \), \( b = 1 \))**
   - Since \( b \le a \), we fall into Case 1: \( n \times a = 10^9 \times 10^9 = 10^{18} \).
   - This matches the expected output.

7. **Example 7: Large values (\( n = 1000 \), \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1000 \))**
   - Since \( b > a \), we check if \( b - a = 999 \ge 1000 \), which is false.
   - We fall into Case 3: \( b - a = 999 < 1000 \).
   - Calculate: \(\text{int}(\frac{999 \times 1000}{2} + 1 \times 1000) = \text{int}(499500 + 1000) = 500500\).
   - This matches the expected output.

Based on the detailed analysis and the provided examples, the program correctly handles all cases as per the problem description and the function summary.
