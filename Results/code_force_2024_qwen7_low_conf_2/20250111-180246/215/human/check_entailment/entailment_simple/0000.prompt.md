You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Bob decided to open a bakery. On the opening day, he baked n buns that he can
sell. The usual price of a bun is a coins, but to attract customers, Bob
organized the following promotion:

  * Bob chooses some integer k (0 \le k \le \min(n, b) ).
  * Bob sells the first k buns at a modified price. In this case, the price of the i -th (1 \le i \le k ) sold bun is (b - i + 1) coins.
  * The remaining (n - k) buns are sold at a coins each.

Note that k can be equal to 0 . In this case, Bob will sell all the buns at a
coins each.

Help Bob determine the maximum profit he can obtain by selling all n buns.

Input

Each test consists of multiple test cases. The first line contains a single
integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) — the number of test cases. The description of
the test cases follows.

The only line of each test case contains three integers n , a , and b (1 \le
n, a, b \le 10^9 ) — the number of buns, the usual price of a bun, and the
price of the first bun to be sold at a modified price.

Output

For each test case, output a single integer — the maximum profit that Bob can
obtain.

Example

Input

    7
    
    4 4 5
    
    5 5 9
    
    10 10 5
    
    5 5 11
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1000000000
    
    1000000000 1000000000 1
    
    1000 1 1000

Output

    17
    35
    100
    45
    1000000000000000000
    1000000000000000000
    500500
    
Note

In the first test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 1 . Then he will
sell one bun for 5 coins, and three buns at the usual price for 4 coins each.
Then the profit will be 5 + 4 + 4 + 4 = 17 coins.

In the second test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 5 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the modified price and obtain a profit of 9 + 8 + 7 + 6 +
5 = 35 coins.

In the third test case, it is optimal for Bob to choose k = 0 . Then he will
sell all the buns at the usual price and obtain a profit of 10 \cdot 10 = 100
coins.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4. Each test case consists of three positive integers n, a, and b such that 1 ≤ n, a, b ≤ 10^9.
def func():
    t = int(input())
    for _ in range(t):
        n, a, b = map(int, input().split())
        
        if b <= a:
            print(n * a)
        elif b - a >= n:
            print(int((2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2))
        else:
            print(int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `t` is an integer input from the user and must be greater than or equal to 1. After all iterations of the loop, the following conditions hold for the variables: For each iteration, if `b <= a`, the output is `n * a`. If `b > a` and `b - a >= n`, the output is `(2 * b - n + 1) * n / 2`. If `b > a` and `b - a < n`, the output is `int((b - a) / 2 * (b - a + 1) + a * n)`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  
Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
