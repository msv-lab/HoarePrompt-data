Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Here’s a detailed breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling:**
   - The program reads the number of test cases (`t`) and processes each test case individually.
   - For each test case, it reads the values of `n`, `m`, and `k` and uses them to compute the expected number of steps required to make the area of the paper strictly less than `k`.
   - The input handling ensures that the constraints are respected (e.g., `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^6` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^12`).

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - The program uses binary search to find the minimum number of steps (`answer`) such that the area of the paper becomes strictly less than `k`.
   - The search range is set to `0` to `max(n, m) * 20` which is a reasonable upper bound considering the constraints.
   - The `func_2` function is used to check if a given number of steps (`steps`) makes the area strictly less than `k`.

3. **Area Calculation:**
   - In the `func_2` function, the program simulates the cutting process and reduces the dimensions of the paper by halving either the height or the width in each step.
   - The function returns `True` if the resulting area (`h * w`) is less than `k` after the specified number of steps.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - Once the number of steps (`answer`) is found, the program calculates `p` (which is `answer`) and `q` (which is `1`).
   - It then computes the modular inverse of `q` (which is `1`) modulo `10^9 + 7` and multiplies `p` by this inverse to get the final result.
   - The result is printed for each test case.

5. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - The use of modular arithmetic ensures that the results fit within the required bounds, and the calculations are performed efficiently.

Since the program follows the exact steps outlined in the problem description, including the input processing, binary search implementation, and the calculation of the result, it is correct. The program handles all the necessary steps and constraints as specified, ensuring that it produces the correct output for any valid input.
