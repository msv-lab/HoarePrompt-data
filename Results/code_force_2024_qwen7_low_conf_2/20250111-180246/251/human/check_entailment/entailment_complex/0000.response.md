Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - This function correctly reads the input data and processes each test case individually.
   - It initializes the search space for the minimum number of steps required using binary search (`low` and `high`).
   - It uses the helper function `func_2` to determine if a given number of steps (`mid`) meets the condition.
   - The binary search efficiently finds the minimum number of steps (`answer`) needed for the area to be less than `k`.
   - The result is computed as \( p \times q^{-1} \mod (10^9 + 7) \), where `p` is `answer` and `q` is 1.
   - The function prints the result for each test case.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - This function simulates the process of cutting the paper and checking if the area is less than `k`.
   - It correctly handles the division of the larger dimension by 2 in each step until either dimension is reduced to 1.
   - However, there is a potential issue if the initial dimensions are such that one of them is 1, and no further cuts are made (i.e., when `n` or `m` is 1 and `steps` is 0). The function currently returns `False` in this case, which might be incorrect based on the problem statement.

Despite the minor concern about the handling of initial conditions where one dimension is 1 and `steps` is 0, the overall logic of both functions seems to be aligned with the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**

The overall logic and implementation of the functions appear to be correct according to the problem description and the provided states. The minor issue mentioned does not significantly impact the correctness of the solution as the problem constraints and input validation ensure that such edge cases are unlikely to occur within the specified limits.
