Reasoning:
1. **Input Handling**: The `func_1` function correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it in a way that allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.
2. **Binary Search Implementation**: The `func_1` function uses a binary search approach to find the minimum number of steps required to make the area of the paper strictly less than `k`. This is done through the call to `func_2`.
3. **Area Calculation in `func_2`**: The `func_2` function simulates cutting the paper by repeatedly halving the larger dimension until the area is less than `k`. This logic appears to be correct for determining if the area can be reduced below `k` within a certain number of steps.
4. **Result Calculation**: The result is calculated using modular arithmetic to ensure the answer fits within the specified constraints. Specifically, `p * q_inv % MOD` computes the required value correctly under the condition that `p` and `q` are coprime.
5. **Modular Inverse**: The use of `pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)` to calculate the modular inverse of `q` is correct and ensures the final result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

Given the logical flow and the correctness of the operations, the provided program seems to accurately solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **True**
