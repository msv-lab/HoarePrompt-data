Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the expected behavior for calculating the expected number of steps required to make the area of the sheet of paper strictly less than \(k\). Specifically, the function `func_2` is flawed in its approach to determining the number of steps.

The core issue lies in how the dimensions of the paper (`h` and `w`) are being reduced. In the function `func_2`, the paper is only cut into halves, which does not accurately reflect the random nature of the cuts as described in the problem statement. The problem requires the paper to be cut randomly along the lines \(x = 1, 2, \ldots, w-1\) and \(y = 1, 2, \ldots, h-1\), but the current implementation only halves the larger dimension.

To illustrate, consider a test case where \(n = 2\), \(m = 4\), and \(k = 2\):

- Initially, the area is \(2 \times 4 = 8\).
- The program will repeatedly halve the larger dimension until the area is less than \(k\).
- This process is deterministic and does not account for the randomness of the cuts, leading to an incorrect number of steps.

For instance, in the given example, the expected number of steps should be calculated using the probability distribution of the random cuts, not just halving the dimensions. The current implementation does not handle this randomness correctly, leading to incorrect results.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is thus incorrect.
