Reasoning:
1. **Function `func_1`**:
   - Reads input from standard input and processes each test case.
   - Uses a binary search approach to find the minimum number of steps (`p`) required for the area of the paper to be strictly less than `k`.
   - Utilizes `func_2` to check the condition after a given number of steps.
   - Computes the modular inverse of `q` and calculates the final result.

2. **Function `func_2`**:
   - Checks whether the area of the paper becomes strictly less than `k` after a given number of steps.
   - Halves the larger dimension of the paper in each step.
   - Returns `True` if the area is less than `k` after the specified number of steps.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - **Initial Dimensions**: If either `n` or `m` is initially 1, the function will not perform any divisions and will directly check if `1 * 1 < k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the function will return `False` immediately without performing any iterations. This edge case is correctly handled.
   - **Zero Steps**: The function `func_2` does not explicitly handle the case where `steps` is 0. In such a scenario, the function should return `False` because no cuts have been made, and the original dimensions `n` and `m` would be checked against `k`. However, since the binary search in `func_1` starts with `high` set to a value that ensures the function `func_2` is called at least once, this specific edge case is not a critical issue in the overall correctness.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The binary search in `func_1` correctly identifies the minimum number of steps required to reduce the area below `k`.
   - The use of `high` set to `max(n, m) * 20` is reasonable to ensure the search space is large enough to find the solution efficiently.

### Conclusion:
Given the descriptions and the provided examples, the implementation of both functions seems to correctly address the problem statement and handle the given constraints. There are no significant issues that would lead to incorrect outputs based on the provided execution summaries and examples.
