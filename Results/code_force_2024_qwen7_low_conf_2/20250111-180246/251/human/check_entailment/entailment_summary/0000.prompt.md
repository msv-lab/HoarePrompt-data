You are a program verifier. Your task is to determine if a given Python program is correct the based on the provided problem description and the execution summaries of its functions. You can use the execution summaries as a guides to understand the program’s behavior. Assume valid inputs as described in the problem.
The program is made of multiple functions and the program is **correct** only if all its functions together meet the problem description.
First explain your reasoning then reply Correctness: **True**  if the given program is correct or Correctness: **False**  if the given program is incorrect.


# Problem:
There is a rectangular sheet of paper with initial height n and width m . Let
the current height and width be h and w respectively. We introduce a xy
-coordinate system so that the four corners of the sheet are (0, 0), (w, 0),
(0, h) , and (w, h) . The sheet can then be cut along the lines x =
1,2,\ldots,w-1 and the lines y = 1,2,\ldots,h-1 . In each step, the paper is
cut randomly along any one of these h+w-2 lines. After each vertical and
horizontal cut, the right and bottom piece of paper respectively are
discarded.

Find the expected number of steps required to make the area of the sheet of
paper strictly less than k . It can be shown that this answer can always be
expressed as a fraction \dfrac{p}{q} where p and q are coprime integers.
Calculate p\cdot q^{-1} \bmod (10^9+7) .

Input

Each test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of
test cases t (1 \le t \le 57000 ). Description of the test cases follows.

The first line of each test case contains 3 integers n , m , and k (1 \le n, m
\le 10^6 , 2 \le k \le 10^{12} ).

It is guaranteed that the sum of n and the sum of m over all test cases do not
exceed 10^6 .

Output

For each test case, print one integer — the answer to the problem.

Example

Input

    4
    
    2 4 10
    
    2 4 8
    
    2 4 2
    
    2 4 6

Output

    0
    1
    833333342
    250000003
    
Note

For the first test case, the area is already less than 10 so no cuts are
required.

For the second test case, the area is exactly 8 so any one of the 4 possible
cuts would make the area strictly less than 8 .

For the third test case, the final answer is \frac{17}{6} = 833\,333\,342\bmod
(10^9+7) .

For the fourth test case, the final answer is \frac{5}{4} = 250\,000\,003\bmod
(10^9+7) .

 Output hints for function1:  The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). It uses a binary search approach to find the smallest integer \(p\) such that a certain condition defined in `func_2(n, m, k, p)` is met. After determining \(p\), it calculates \(q\) as 1 and \(q^{-1}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Finally, it computes \(p \times q^{-1} \mod 10^9 + 7\) and stores these results in a list. The function then prints each result. If the sum of all \(n\) and \(m\) across all test cases exceeds \(10^6\), the function would encounter an error due to an unhandled condition in the given code.

 Output hints for function2:  The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `steps`. 

- `n` and `m` represent the initial height and width of the paper, respectively.
- `k` represents the threshold area.
- `steps` represents the number of cutting steps taken.

The function repeatedly divides the larger dimension (either height `h` or width `w`) by 2 until either dimension is reduced to 1, ensuring that both dimensions are halved in each step unless one dimension is already smaller than or equal to the other. After `steps` iterations, the function checks if the product of the final height `h` and width `w` is less than the threshold area `k`. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it does not return anything, implying the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `n` or `m` is initially 1, the function will not perform any divisions and will directly check if `1 * 1 < k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the function will return `False` immediately without performing any iterations.
- The function does not handle the case where `steps` is 0. In such a scenario, the function should return `False` because no cuts have been made, and the original dimensions `n` and `m` would be checked against `k`.

In summary, the function returns `True` if the final area after `steps` cuts is less than `k`, and it returns `False` otherwise.
