### Reasoning:

Let's analyze the provided code and function summary to evaluate the correctness of the program.

#### Function `func_2` Analysis:
- **Purpose**: Determine if the area of the paper is less than `k` after `steps` random cuts.
- **Flaws**:
  - The function only reduces the larger dimension by half, which is not a random cut. It does not simulate the random nature of the cuts as described in the problem.
  - The function does not handle the case where `steps` is 0, which should return `False` because no cuts have been made.
  - The function assumes that the paper is always cut into halves, which is deterministic and not random.

#### Main Program Analysis:
- **Initialization**: The program reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
- **Binary Search**: Uses binary search to find the minimum number of steps required to make the area strictly less than `k`.
- **Function Call**: Calls `func_2` with the number of steps to determine if the area is less than `k`.
- **Modular Arithmetic**: Computes the final result using modular arithmetic.

Given the above analysis, the function `func_2` is fundamentally flawed because it does not simulate the random nature of the cuts. The original assessment correctly identified this flaw. However, the program itself does not attempt to simulate the random cuts but rather performs a deterministic operation.

Since the problem specifically requires simulating random cuts, the provided solution does not meet the requirements. The program's logic is incorrect because it does not simulate the random cuts, leading to incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not simulate the random cuts as required by the problem statement. The function `func_2` only halves the dimensions deterministically, which does not reflect the random nature of the cuts.
