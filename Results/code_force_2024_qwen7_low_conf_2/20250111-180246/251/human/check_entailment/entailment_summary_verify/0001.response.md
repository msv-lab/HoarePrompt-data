### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The `func_1` function correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it to handle multiple test cases efficiently. This part of the assessment is accurate.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**:
   - The `func_1` function uses a binary search approach to find the minimum number of steps required to make the area of the paper strictly less than `k`. This is done through the call to `func_2`. However, there is a critical flaw in the binary search implementation. The binary search is intended to find the minimum number of steps required, but the way it is implemented might lead to incorrect results. Specifically, the `func_2` function is only called with a fixed `steps` value, which is not dynamically adjusted based on the binary search range. Instead, it should check the conditions for each step count in the binary search range. The original assessment did not highlight this issue, which could lead to an incorrect number of steps being determined.

3. **Area Calculation in `func_2`**:
   - The `func_2` function simulates cutting the paper by repeatedly halving the larger dimension until the area is less than `k`. This logic is fundamentally flawed because it does not correctly simulate the random cutting process described in the problem statement. The function only halves the larger dimension, which does not reflect the random nature of the cuts. The cuts should be made along any one of the lines x = 1, 2, ..., w-1 and y = 1, 2, ..., h-1, and the right and bottom pieces are discarded after each cut. The original assessment did not address this discrepancy, which is crucial for the solution's correctness.

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - The result calculation using modular arithmetic is correct. However, the issue with the binary search and the incorrect area calculation in `func_2` means that the final result may not be accurate.

5. **Modular Inverse**:
   - The use of `pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)` to calculate the modular inverse of `q` is correct and ensures the final result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\). This part of the assessment is accurate.

Given the issues identified, the provided program does not correctly implement the problem's requirements. The binary search and area calculation logic are flawed, leading to potentially incorrect results.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**
