### Reasoning:

Let's revisit the original assessment and the provided program to ensure we understand the core issues and verify the program's correctness.

#### Core Issues Identified in the Original Assessment:
1. **Deterministic Halving**: The function `func_2` only halves the larger dimension in each step, which does not accurately simulate the random nature of the cuts.
2. **Lack of Randomness**: The problem specifies that the paper can be cut randomly along the lines \(x = 1, 2, \ldots, w-1\) and \(y = 1, 2, \ldots, h-1\), but the current implementation does not incorporate this randomness.

#### Analysis of the Provided Program:
1. **Function `func_2`**:
   - The function `func_2` iteratively reduces the larger dimension by half until the product of the dimensions is less than `k`.
   - This deterministic halving does not simulate the random nature of the cuts, as mentioned in the original assessment.

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - The function `func_1` uses binary search to find the minimum number of steps required to reduce the area to less than `k`.
   - The `binary_search` logic in `func_1` relies on the correctness of `func_2`, which itself is flawed.

Given these points, let's re-evaluate the program with a more rigorous approach:

#### Correct Approach:
To correctly solve this problem, we need to model the random nature of the cuts. This involves simulating the process of making random cuts until the area is less than `k`. However, the provided program does not simulate randomness and instead uses a deterministic approach.

#### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Random Cuts**: The paper can be cut randomly, and each cut must be considered probabilistically.
2. **Expected Value Calculation**: The solution requires calculating the expected number of steps, which is a stochastic process.

#### Conclusion:
The provided program does not accurately simulate the random cuts as specified in the problem statement. Instead, it uses a deterministic approach that does not reflect the true nature of the problem. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

### Final Evaluation:
Final: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the expected behavior for calculating the expected number of steps required to make the area of the sheet of paper strictly less than \(k\).
