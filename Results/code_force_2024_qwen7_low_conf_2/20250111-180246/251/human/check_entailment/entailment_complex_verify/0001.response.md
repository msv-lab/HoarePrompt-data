### Reasoning:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The `func_1` function correctly reads the input using `sys.stdin.read` and processes it in a way that allows handling multiple test cases efficiently.
   - The initialization of variables (`t`, `data`, `MOD`, `idx`, etc.) is done correctly, and the overall structure for iterating through test cases is sound.

2. **Binary Search Implementation**: 
   - The `func_1` function uses a binary search approach to find the minimum number of steps required to make the area of the paper strictly less than `k`. This is done through the call to `func_2`.
   - The logic for binary search is correct. The function initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to `max(n, m) * 20`, which sets up the range for the search. The binary search iteratively narrows down the range until the correct number of steps is found.

3. **Area Calculation in `func_2`**: 
   - The `func_2` function simulates cutting the paper by repeatedly halving the larger dimension until the area is less than `k`. This logic appears to be correct for determining if the area can be reduced below `k` within a certain number of steps.
   - However, there is a potential issue with the initial value of `high`. The value `max(n, m) * 20` is an arbitrary choice. While it might work in most cases, it could lead to inefficiency or even infinite loops if the initial dimensions are very large and the threshold `k` is very small. A more precise calculation of `high` based on the properties of the problem would be beneficial.

4. **Result Calculation**: 
   - The result is calculated using modular arithmetic to ensure the answer fits within the specified constraints. Specifically, `p * q_inv % MOD` computes the required value correctly under the condition that `p` and `q` are coprime.
   - The use of `pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)` to calculate the modular inverse of `q` is correct and ensures the final result is computed modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

5. **Modular Inverse**: 
   - The calculation of the modular inverse is correct, and the use of `pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)` ensures that the result is within the specified constraints.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:
- As mentioned in the original assessment, if `n` or `m` is initially 1, the function will not perform any divisions and will directly check if `1 * 1 < k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the function will return `False` immediately without performing any iterations. This is correctly handled.
- The function does not explicitly handle the case where `steps` is 0. In such a scenario, the function should return `False` because no cuts have been made, and the original dimensions `n` and `m` would be checked against `k`. However, since the binary search approach will naturally return 0 in this case, this is effectively handled.

### Conclusion:
While the program logic is fundamentally sound and the approach to solving the problem is correct, there are minor issues related to the arbitrary choice of `high` in the binary search, which could lead to inefficiency in some edge cases. However, these issues do not significantly impact the correctness of the solution.

**Final: True**

The provided program is correct, although improvements could be made to handle edge cases more robustly.
