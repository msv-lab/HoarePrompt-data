The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to be `mid + 1`. From the initial state, we know that `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` must be `0` or `(0 + high) // 2 + 1`, and `high` is greater than or equal to `low`.

Given the code, `low` is now updated to `mid + 1`. Since `mid` is already defined as `(low + high) // 2`, we substitute this into the new equation for `low`:

\[ \text{new } low = (low + high) // 2 + 1 \]

This means `low` is now one more than half of the sum of its original value and `high`.

The states of the other variables (`data`, `idx`, `high`, `mid`, `answer`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1 + 1`, `high` is greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `answer` is equal to `mid` (if the condition is met), or `mid` remains unchanged.**
