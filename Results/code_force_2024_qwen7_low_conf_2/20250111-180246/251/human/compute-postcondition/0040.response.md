Let's break down the problem step by step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

### Initial States:
- `data` is a list with at least 3 elements.
- `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations`.
- `low` is `high + 1` (or 0 if the loop did not execute).
- `high` is the last value `high` took before it became greater than `low`.
- `mid` is the last calculated midpoint `(low + high) // 2`.
- `answer` is the value of `mid` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, or `max(n, m) * 20` if no such `mid` exists.
- `p` is equal to `answer`.
- `q` is `1`.
- `q_inv` is `1`.
- `result` is `answer % MOD`.
- `results` is a list with one additional element `result`.

### Loop Execution:
The loop `for _ in range(t):` runs `t` times. The state changes inside the loop are not explicitly given, but we need to consider how the loop affects the variables involved.

### Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:
To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that the loop condition holds true. The loop condition is determined by the values of `low` and `high`. Specifically, the loop continues as long as `low <= high`.

Given the current states:
- `low` is `high + 1` (or 0 if the loop did not execute).
- `high` is the last value `high` took before it became greater than `low`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. Since `low` is currently `high + 1` (or 0), the only way for this to change is if the loop condition inside the body modifies `low` or `high` to make `low <= high` true.

Since the exact loop body is not provided, we assume the following general behavior:
- The loop likely adjusts `low` and `high` based on some condition involving `mid` and the function `func_2`.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **`idx`**: The variable `idx` is updated by adding `3 * num_iterations`. For the next iteration, `num_iterations` will increase by 1.
2. **`low` and `high`**: These variables must be adjusted so that `low <= high` holds true. Given the current state where `low` is `high + 1` (or 0), the loop body must adjust these values to make them satisfy `low <= high`.
3. **`mid`**: This is the midpoint calculated during each iteration, which might be updated based on the loop body.
4. **`answer`**: This remains the same unless the loop finds a new valid `mid` that makes `func_2` return True.
5. **`p`, `q`, `q_inv`, `result`, `results`**: These remain unchanged as they are derived from `answer` and do not directly affect the loop condition.

### Final State:
To ensure the loop executes one more time, we need to adjust `low` and `high` so that `low <= high` holds true. Assuming the loop body updates `low` and `high` correctly:

State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1)`, `low` is updated to a value less than or equal to `high`, `high` is updated to a value greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `answer` is the value of `mid` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, or `max(n, m) * 20` if no such `mid` exists, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`**.

This ensures the loop condition `low <= high` is satisfied, allowing the loop to execute one more time.
