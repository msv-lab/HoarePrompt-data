The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` by setting it to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` was \((low + high) // 2\), so the new value of `low` is \((low + high) // 2 + 1\). The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the updated values are:
- `data` is a list with at least 3 elements (unchanged)
- `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3` (unchanged)
- `results` is a list with one additional element `result` (unchanged)
- `low` is now \((low + high) // 2 + 1\) (changed)
- `high` remains unchanged
- `mid` remains unchanged (equal to \((low + high) // 2\))

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements; `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`; `results` is a list with one additional element `result`; `low` is \((low + high) // 2 + 1); `high` is unchanged; `mid` is \((low + high) // 2)**
