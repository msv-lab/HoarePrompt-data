The code initializes two variables, `low` and `high`, where `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to twice the maximum of `n` and `m`. The other variables (`t`, `idx`, `data`, `k`) are not affected by this code.

- The value of `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`.
- The value of `m` is an integer value.
- The value of `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`.
- The value of `idx` is updated to `idx + 3`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `low` is 0, `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`**
