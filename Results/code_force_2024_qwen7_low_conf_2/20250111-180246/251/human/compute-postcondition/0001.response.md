According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `steps`. The loop will execute as long as `steps` is at least 1. Given the initial states, we need to adjust the state such that the loop can begin execution.

Here are the steps:

1. `h` is `n` and `w` is `m`: These values do not affect whether the loop can execute, so they do not need to be modified.
2. `k` is a positive integer representing the threshold area: This value does not affect whether the loop can execute, so it does not need to be modified.
3. `steps` is a non-negative integer representing the number of cutting steps taken: For the loop to execute, `steps` must be greater than 0.

Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `steps` must be greater than 0.

State: **`h` is `n`, `w` is `m`, `k` is a positive integer representing the threshold area, and `steps` must be greater than 0**
