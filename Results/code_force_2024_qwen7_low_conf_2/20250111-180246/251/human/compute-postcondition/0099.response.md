Postcondition: ***`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`. If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, then `answer` is set to `mid` and `high` is updated to `(low + (low + high) // 2) // 2 - 1`. Otherwise, `low` is set to `(low + high) // 2 + 1` and `mid` is recalculated as `(low + high) // 2`.***
