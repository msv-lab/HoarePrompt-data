Postcondition: ***`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`. If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns true, then `low` is `0`, `high` is `mid - 1`, and `answer` is `(low + high) // 2`. Otherwise, `low` is `10 * max(n, m) + 1`, `high` is `20 * max(n, m)`, and `answer` is `20 * max(n, m)`.***
