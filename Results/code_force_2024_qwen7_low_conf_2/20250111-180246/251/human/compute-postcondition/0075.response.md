`m` is assigned the value of `int(data[idx + 1])`. The value of `data[idx + 1]` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `m`, but we know it is an integer. The value of `t` remains greater than 0, and the value of `n` remains the integer value of `data[idx]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value**
