Output State: **`results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being `answer % MOD`.**

Explanation:
- The loop `for res in results:` simply iterates over the `results` list and prints each element.
- Since the loop does not modify any of the variables within the provided code snippet, the state of the variables remains unchanged.
- After the loop completes all iterations, `results` will still be a list containing `t` elements, each being `answer % MOD`.

The loop itself does not change the length of the `results` list or introduce any new elements. It only iterates over the existing elements and prints them. Therefore, the final state of the variables will be the same as the state just before the loop started, with the added condition that the `results` list has been fully printed. However, since no new elements are added during the loop, the list remains unchanged in terms of content.

Thus, the output state after the loop finishes executing all iterations is:
Output State: **`results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being `answer % MOD`.**
