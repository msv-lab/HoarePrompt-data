The code assigns the value of `high` to `answer`. The value of `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`, where `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]` and `m` is an integer value. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `low` is 0, `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 20**
