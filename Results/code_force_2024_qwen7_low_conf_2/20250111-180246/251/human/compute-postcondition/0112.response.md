The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of `res`. The value of `res` is taken from the initial state, which is `results[t+1]`. The print statement does not change the value of any variable but only outputs it. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state except that the value of `res` is printed.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing t+1 elements, each being `answer % MOD`, `res` is `results[t+1]`, and the value of `res` is printed.**
