According to the code, the loop condition is based on the value of `h * w`. If `h * w < k`, the function returns True and the loop terminates. Otherwise, the values of `h` and `w` are updated, and `n` is set to `h`. The loop continues to execute as long as `h * w >= k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `h` and `w` are integers.
- If `h * w < k`, the function returns True. Otherwise, `h` is set to the maximum of `w // 2` and 1, `w` remains as the maximum of `w // 2` and 1, `n` is set to `h`, and all other variables (`k` and `steps`) remain unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `h * w >= k` must be true. Therefore, `h` and `w` must be updated according to the rules given.

Step-by-step adjustment:

1. **Initial Condition**: `h * w >= k`.
2. **Update Rule**: `h` is set to the maximum of `w // 2` and 1, and `w` remains as the maximum of `w // 2` and 1.
3. **New Values**: After the update, both `h` and `w` will be the maximum of their current value divided by 2 (rounded down) and 1.

Thus, the new values of `h` and `w` will be:
- `h = max(w // 2, 1)`
- `w = max(w // 2, 1)`

The other variables (`k` and `steps`) remain unchanged.

State: **`h` is max(`w` // 2, 1), `w` is max(`w` // 2, 1), `n` is `h`, `k` remains unchanged, `steps` remains unchanged**
