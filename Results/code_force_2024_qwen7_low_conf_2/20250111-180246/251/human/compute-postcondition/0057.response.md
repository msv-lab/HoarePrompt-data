The code `answer = mid` assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `answer`. The value of `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `answer` is `(low + high) // 2**
