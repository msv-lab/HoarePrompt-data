The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high` to be `mid - 1`. Given that `mid` is initially set to `max(n, m) * 10`, the new value of `high` will be `max(n, m) * 10 - 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `low` is 0, `high` is `max(n, m) * 10 - 1`, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 10`, `mid` is `max(n, m) * 10`**
