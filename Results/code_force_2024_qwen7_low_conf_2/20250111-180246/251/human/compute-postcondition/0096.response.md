`answer` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is `(low + high) // 2`. The values of `low` and `high` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `answer` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `answer` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
