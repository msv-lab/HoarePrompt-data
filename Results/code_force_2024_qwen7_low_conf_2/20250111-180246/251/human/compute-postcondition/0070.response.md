`q_inv` is assigned the value of `pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)`. Given that `q` is 1, the value of `q_inv` can be calculated as `pow(1, MOD - 2, MOD)`, which simplifies to 1 because any number raised to any power and then taken modulo itself (if the number is 1) remains 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`, `low` is 0, `high` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value such that `func_2(n, m, k, answer)` is true, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1**
