Postcondition: ***`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element. Depending on the evaluation of `func_2(n, m, k, mid)`, either `high` is set to `((low + high) // 2) - 1` with `answer` being `(low + high) // 2`, or `low` is set to `(low + high) // 2 + 1` with `mid` being `(low + high) // 2`.***
