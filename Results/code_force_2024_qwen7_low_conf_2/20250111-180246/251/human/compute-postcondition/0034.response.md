Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations`, `low` is `high + 1` (or 0 if the loop did not execute), `high` is the last value `high` took before it became greater than `low`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint `(low + high) // 2`, and `answer` is the value of `mid` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, or `max(n, m) * 20` if no such `mid` exists.**
