Let's analyze the given program state and the `while` loop condition step by step.

### Given Program State:
- `data` is a list with at least 3 elements.
- `idx` is updated as `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`.
- `results` is a list with one additional element `result`.
- The function `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` determines the values of `low`, `high`, and `answer`.

### While Loop Condition:
```
while low <= high:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
2. **Condition Check**: For the loop to continue, `low` must remain less than or equal to `high`.
3. **Function Behavior**:
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`, then `low = 0`, `high = mid - 1`, and `answer = (low + high) // 2`.
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `False`, then `low = 10 * max(n, m) + 1`, `high = 20 * max(n, m)`, and `answer = 20 * max(n, m)`.

### Determining the Necessary Adjustments:
To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to ensure that the condition `low <= high` holds true after the adjustments.

#### Case 1: `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` Returns `True`
- If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`, then `low` becomes `0` and `high` becomes `mid - 1`.
- Since `mid` is a value derived from some previous computation, the specific value of `mid` is not known. However, we know that for the loop to continue, `0 <= mid - 1` must hold true.
- This simplifies to `mid > 0`.

#### Case 2: `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` Returns `False`
- If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `False`, then `low` becomes `10 * max(n, m) + 1` and `high` remains `20 * max(n, m)`.
- To ensure the loop continues, `10 * max(n, m) + 1 <= 20 * max(n, m)` must hold true.
- This inequality simplifies to `10 * max(n, m) + 1 <= 20 * max(n, m)`, which is always true since `10 * max(n, m) + 1` is always less than or equal to `20 * max(n, m)`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will continue as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. In both cases, the condition `low <= high` is satisfied. Therefore, no additional state needs to be adjusted beyond what is already provided.

### Final Answer:
State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`, and the loop can continue as `low` is less than or equal to `high` based on the conditions specified.**

Note: The exact value of `mid` in the first case (`func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns `True`) should be such that `0 <= mid - 1`, but since we don't have specific values, we focus on the loop condition itself.
