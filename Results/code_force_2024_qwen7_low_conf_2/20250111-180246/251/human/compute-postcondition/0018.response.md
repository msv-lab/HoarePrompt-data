The initial state is defined as follows:
- `h` is `max(w // 2, 1)`
- `w` is `max(w // 2, 1)`
- `n` is `h`
- `k` remains unchanged
- `steps` remains unchanged

The code snippet is:
```python
w = max(w // 2, 1)
```

This line of code updates the value of `w` to be the maximum of `w // 2` and 1. Since `w` was initially defined as `max(w // 2, 1)`, it means that `w` is already the maximum of `w // 2` and 1.

Therefore, the value of `w` does not change because it is already in its maximized form. The other variables (`h`, `n`, `k`, and `steps`) remain unchanged as per the initial state description.

Output State: **`h` is `max(w // 2, 1)`, `w` is `max(w // 2, 1)`, `n` is `h`, `k` remains unchanged, `steps` remains unchanged**
