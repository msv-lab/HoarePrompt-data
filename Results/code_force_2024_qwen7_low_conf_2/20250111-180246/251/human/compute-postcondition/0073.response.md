According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `t` is greater than 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following states were observed:
- `data` is a list with at least 3 elements.
- `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations + 3`.
- `results` is a list with two additional elements where the second last element is `results[-2]` and the last element is `answer % MOD`.
- `low` is 0.
- `high` is 0.
- `answer` is the smallest value such that `func_2(n, m, k, answer)` is true.
- `mid` is the last calculated midpoint.
- `p` is equal to `answer`.
- `q` is 1.
- `q_inv` is 1.
- `result` is `answer % MOD`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `t` must be greater than 0. Since `t` is the only variable that controls the number of iterations in the loop, we need to ensure that `t` is greater than 0 at the start of the next iteration.

The other states (`data`, `idx`, `results`, `low`, `high`, `answer`, `mid`, `p`, `q`, `q_inv`, and `result`) do not change based on the loop condition but might be updated inside the loop body.

State: **`t` must be greater than 0**
