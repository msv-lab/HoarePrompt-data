The code `print(res)` simply prints the value of `res`. The variable `res` is not defined in the given code snippet, and neither is its value changed by this line of code. Therefore, the initial state remains unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being `answer % MOD'**, res is undefined.
