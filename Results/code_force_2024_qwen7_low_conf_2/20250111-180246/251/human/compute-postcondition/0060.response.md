Postcondition: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`. If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to true, then `low` is less than or equal to `high - 1` and `mid` is \((low + high - 1) // 2\). Otherwise, `low` is updated to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\) and `mid` remains \((low + high) // 2\)**.
