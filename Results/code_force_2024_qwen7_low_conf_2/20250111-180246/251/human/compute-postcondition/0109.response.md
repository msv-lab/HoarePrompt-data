According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `results`. The loop iterates over each element in the `results` list. At the end of the last iteration, `results` contains `t` elements, and each element is `answer % MOD`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the list `results` must have at least `t+1` elements. Since the loop iterates over each element in `results`, the next element will be processed if `results` has an additional element.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `results` has `t` elements.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `results` must have `t+1` elements.

State: **`results` is a list containing `t+1` elements, each being `answer % MOD`**
