`mid` is assigned the value of `(low + high) // 2`. This operation calculates the midpoint between `low` and `high` and assigns it to `mid`. The values of `data`, `idx`, `results`, and the conditions for the loop (i.e., `low <= high`) are not directly affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is the value of `(low + high) // 2`.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
