The code assigns the values of `n` and `m` to `h` and `w` respectively. The values of `k` and `steps` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will include the updated values of `h` and `w` along with the unchanged values of `k` and `steps`.

Output State: **`h` is `n`, `w` is `m`, `k` is a positive integer representing the threshold area, and `steps` is a non-negative integer representing the number of cutting steps taken.**
