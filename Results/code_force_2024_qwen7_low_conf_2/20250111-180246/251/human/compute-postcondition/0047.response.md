Let's break down the conditions required for the `while` loop to execute at least once:

1. The loop condition is `low <= high`.
2. We know `low` is set to 0 and `high` is set to `max(n, m) * 20`.

For the loop to execute, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. Given that `low` is 0, the critical part here is `high`.

- `high` is initially set to `max(n, m) * 20`.

Since `n` and `m` are integers and `high` is defined as `max(n, m) * 20`, we need to ensure that `high` is greater than or equal to `low` (which is 0). 

Given that `high` is already set to a value based on `max(n, m) * 20`, we do not need to adjust any other state variables directly related to the loop condition.

However, we should verify that `high` is indeed a valid starting point for the loop. Since `low` is 0, `high` being non-negative and greater than or equal to 0 ensures that the loop can proceed. Therefore, no adjustments to the given states are necessary.

Thus, the states do not need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `low` is 0, `high` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `answer` is `max(n, m) * 20`, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`**
