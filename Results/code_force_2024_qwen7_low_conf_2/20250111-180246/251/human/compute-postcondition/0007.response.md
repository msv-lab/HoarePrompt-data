Postcondition: ***`h` and `w` are integers. If `h` is greater than `w`, then `h` is set to `h // 2` and `w` remains as `m`. Otherwise, `h` remains as `n` and `w` is set to the maximum of `m // 2` and 1. `k` is a positive integer representing the threshold area, and `steps` must be greater than 0. The product of `h` and `w` is less than `k`***
