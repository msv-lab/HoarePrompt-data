The code snippet `print(res)` prints the value of the variable `res`. However, the variable `res` is not defined in the given code snippet, and neither is it assigned any value within the provided snippet. Therefore, the execution of this line will simply print the current value of `res`, which is undefined in this context. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`results` is a list containing `t+1` elements, each being `answer % MOD', `res` is undefined (or its value is printed).**
