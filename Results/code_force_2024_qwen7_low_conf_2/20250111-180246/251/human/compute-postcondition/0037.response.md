The code snippet `q_inv = pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)` calculates the modular inverse of `q` using the given modulus `MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of `data`, `idx`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `answer`, `p`, or `q`. It only updates `q_inv`.

Since the exact value of `MOD` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact value of `q_inv`. However, the operation itself is performed, and `q_inv` is assigned the result.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations`, `low` is `high + 1` (or 0 if the loop did not execute), `high` is the last value `high` took before it became greater than `low`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint `(low + high) // 2`, `answer` is the value of `mid` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, or `max(n, m) * 20` if no such `mid` exists, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is the modular inverse of `q` modulo `MOD`.**
