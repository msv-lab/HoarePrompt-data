Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`. `low` is 0, `high` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value such that `func_2(n, m, k, answer)` is true, and `mid` is the last calculated midpoint.**

Explanation:
1. **Initial State**: The loop starts with `low` and `high` initialized based on the conditions inside the loop. After the loop terminates, both `low` and `high` will converge to a single value since the loop continues to narrow down the search space until `low` is strictly less than `high`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `low <= high`. Once the loop exits, `low` and `high` will be equal, and `answer` will be the value that satisfies the condition `func_2(n, m, k, answer)`.

3. **Variable Values**:
   - `idx`: Increases by `3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3` each iteration, so after `num_iterations` iterations, it is `idx + 3 * num_iterations + 3`.
   - `results`: Contains one additional element `result` which is the final value of `answer`.
   - `low`: Initially set to 0 and increases as `low` is updated to `mid + 1` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is false. It converges to `answer` and finally becomes 0.
   - `high`: Initially set to `max(n, m) * 20` and decreases as `high` is updated to `mid - 1` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true. It also converges to `answer` and finally becomes 0.
   - `answer`: This is the value of `mid` when `low` and `high` meet, satisfying `func_2(n, m, k, answer)`.
   - `mid`: This is the midpoint calculated during each iteration of the loop, which helps to narrow down the range between `low` and `high`.

Given the above analysis, the loop converges to a point where `low` and `high` are equal, and `answer` holds the value that satisfies the condition within the loop. Therefore, the final state of the variables after the loop is as stated above.
