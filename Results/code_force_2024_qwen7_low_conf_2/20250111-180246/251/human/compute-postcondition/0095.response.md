The code assigns the value of `(low + high) // 2` to the variable `mid`. This calculation takes the average of `low` and `high` and performs integer division. Since `low` is less than or equal to `high`, the value of `mid` will be the floor division of their sum. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
