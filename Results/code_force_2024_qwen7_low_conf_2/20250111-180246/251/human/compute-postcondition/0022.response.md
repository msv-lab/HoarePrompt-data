Output State: **`h` and `w` are integers. `h` is the result of applying the operation `max(value // 2, 1)` repeatedly starting from `n` for each iteration where `h > w`, and `w` is the result of applying the same operation starting from `m` for each iteration where `w >= h`. `k` is a positive integer representing the threshold area, and `steps` is the total number of iterations the loop executed. If after all iterations `h * w >= k`, the function does not return, otherwise it returns True.**
