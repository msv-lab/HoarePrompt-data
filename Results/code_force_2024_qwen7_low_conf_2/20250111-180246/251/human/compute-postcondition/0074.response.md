The code `n = int(data[idx])` assigns the value of `data[idx]` (converted to an integer) to the variable `n`. The initial state is that `t` must be greater than 0. The variable `t` is not affected by this code, and the value of `data[idx]` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`.

Output State: **`t` must be greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`**
