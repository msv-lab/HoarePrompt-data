`idx` is incremented by 3. The other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`.**
