The code calculates the modular inverse of `q` using the formula `pow(q, MOD - 2, MOD)`. However, since the values of `MOD`, `q`, and other variables are not specified, we can only express the result in terms of these variables.

The value of `q_inv` is the modular inverse of `q` under modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `low` is 0, `high` is 0, `answer` is 0, `mid` is 0, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is `pow(1, MOD - 2, MOD)`**
