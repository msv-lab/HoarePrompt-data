The code appends the value of `result` to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the value of `idx` is updated to `idx + 3`, and `result` is added to the list `results`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `low` is 0, `high` is 0, `answer` is 0, `mid` is 0, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` contains `answer % MOD`**
