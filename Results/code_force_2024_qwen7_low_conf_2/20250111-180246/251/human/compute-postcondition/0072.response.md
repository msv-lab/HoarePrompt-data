The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the current value of the variable `result` to the list `results`. The variable `result` is currently equal to `answer % MOD`. Therefore, after executing this line of code, the list `results` will have one more element, which is `answer % MOD`.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations + 3`, `results` is a list with two additional elements where the second last element is `results[-2]` and the last element is `answer % MOD`, `low` is 0, `high` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value such that `func_2(n, m, k, answer)` is true, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`**
