The code snippet `results.append(result)` appends the current value of `result` to the list `results`. However, the initial values of the variables and their states do not change as a result of this operation. The only change is the addition of `result` to the list `results`.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations`, `low` is `high + 1` (or 0 if the loop did not execute), `high` is the last value `high` took before it became greater than `low`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint `(low + high) // 2`, `answer` is the value of `mid` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, or `max(n, m) * 20` if no such `mid` exists, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`.**
