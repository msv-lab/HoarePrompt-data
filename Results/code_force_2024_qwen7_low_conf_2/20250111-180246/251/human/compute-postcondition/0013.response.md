Postcondition: ***`h` and `w` are integers. If `h` is greater than `w`, then `h` is set to `max(n // 2, 1)` and `w` remains as the maximum of `m // 2` and 1. Otherwise, `h` is set to the maximum of `w // 2` and 1, `w` remains as the maximum of `w // 2` and 1, `n` is set to `h`, and all other variables (`k` and `steps`) remain unchanged.***
