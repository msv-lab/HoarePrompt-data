The variable `p` is assigned the value of `answer`. The other variables are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the `answer` variable remains unchanged, and the other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`, `low` is 0, `high` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value such that `func_2(n, m, k, answer)` is true, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `p` is equal to `answer`.**
