The code `idx += 3` increments the value of `idx` by 3. Based on the initial state, `idx` was previously set to `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1)`. After this operation, the new value of `idx` will be `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`.

All other variables remain unchanged according to the given initial state.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `low` is updated to a value less than or equal to `high`, `high` is updated to a value greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `answer` is the value of `mid` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, or `max(n, m) * 20` if no such `mid` exists, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`**.
