Functionality: **The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). It uses a binary search approach to find the smallest integer \(p\) such that a certain condition defined in `func_2(n, m, k, p)` is met. After determining \(p\), it calculates \(q\) as 1 and \(q^{-1}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Finally, it computes \(p \times q^{-1} \mod 10^9 + 7\) and stores these results in a list. The function then prints each result. If the sum of all \(n\) and \(m\) across all test cases exceeds \(10^6\), the function would encounter an error due to an unhandled condition in the given code.**

**Edge Cases and Missing Functionality:**
- If the sum of all \(n\) and \(m\) across all test cases exceeds \(10^6\), the function should handle this scenario by either raising an exception or returning an appropriate error message, as the current code does not explicitly handle this case.
- The function assumes that `func_2` is defined elsewhere and works correctly. If `func_2` fails to meet the expected conditions, the function may return incorrect results.
