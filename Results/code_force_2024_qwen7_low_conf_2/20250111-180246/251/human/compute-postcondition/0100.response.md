Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `low` is 0, `high` is 0, `answer` is 0, `mid` is 0, and `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is the result of the final if-else block evaluation. If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is true, then `answer` is the smallest integer such that the condition specified by `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` holds, otherwise `answer` is the largest integer such that the condition does not hold.**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to narrow down the range between `low` and `high` until `low` exceeds `high`.
- The final value of `low` will be just above `high`, meaning the search space is exhausted.
- `answer` will be set to the last valid midpoint `mid` that satisfies the condition `func_2(n, m, k, mid) == True`, or it will be the closest value to this midpoint where the condition no longer holds.
