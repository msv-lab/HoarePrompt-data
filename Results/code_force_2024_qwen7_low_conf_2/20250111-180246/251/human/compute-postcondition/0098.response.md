`low` is assigned the value `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` becomes `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. The value of `high` remains unchanged, and `mid` also remains unchanged because it was only defined in terms of `low` and `high`, which are not redefined. Therefore, the Output State is: `low` is less than or equal to `high`; `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`; `low` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.

Output State: **`low` is equal to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` is unchanged, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`**
