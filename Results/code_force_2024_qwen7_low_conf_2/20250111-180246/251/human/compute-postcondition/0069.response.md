`q` is assigned the value `1`. The value of `q` is now 1, but the values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`, `low` is 0, `high` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value such that `func_2(n, m, k, answer)` is true, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is 1.**
