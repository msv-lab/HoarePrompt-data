The code assigns the value of `mid + 1` to `low`. Since `mid` is defined as `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be `(low + high) // 2 + 1`. The other variables (`data`, `idx`, `results`, `low`, `high`, and `mid`) are updated accordingly.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element, `low` is `(low + high) // 2 + 1`, `high` must be greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`**
