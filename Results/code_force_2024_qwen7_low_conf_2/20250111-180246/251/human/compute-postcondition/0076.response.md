`k` is assigned the value of `int(data[idx + 2])`. The value of `data[idx + 2]` is converted to an integer, but the specific value of `data[idx + 2]` is not given. The states of the other variables (`t`, `n`, and `m`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`**
