The code snippet assigns the value of `p * q_inv` modulo `MOD` to `result`. Given the initial state:

- `data` is a list with at least 3 elements
- `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations + 3`
- `results` is a list with one additional element `result`
- `low` is 0
- `high` is 0
- `answer` is the smallest value such that `func_2(n, m, k, answer)` is true
- `mid` is the last calculated midpoint
- `p` is equal to `answer`
- `q` is 1
- `q_inv` is 1

After executing `result = p * q_inv % MOD`, since `q_inv` is 1, the expression simplifies to `result = p * 1 % MOD`, which further simplifies to `result = p % MOD`.

The output state will include the updated value of `result` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * num_iterations + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`, `low` is 0, `high` is 0, `answer` is the smallest value such that `func_2(n, m, k, answer)` is true, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is 1, `q_inv` is 1, `result` is `answer % MOD`**
