`n` is assigned the value of `data[idx]`. The value of `idx` is updated to `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1)`, but since `num_iterations` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact new value of `idx`. The values of `low`, `high`, `mid`, `answer`, `p`, `q`, `q_inv`, and `result` remain unchanged. The list `results` gains a new element which is `result`.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1)`, `low` is updated to a value less than or equal to `high`, `high` is updated to a value greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `answer` is the value of `mid` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, or `max(n, m) * 20` if no such `mid` exists, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`**
