The code sets `high` to `mid - 1`. This means the value of `high` is updated from its previous value to `mid - 1`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `low` is either `0` or `((0 + max(n, m) * 20) // 2) + 1`, `high` is `mid - 1`, `answer` is either `max(n, m) * 10` or \(\frac{(3 * (max(n, m) * 20) + 20)}{4}\), `mid` is either \(max(n, m) * 10\) or \(\frac{(3 * (max(n, m) * 20) + 20)}{4}\)**.
