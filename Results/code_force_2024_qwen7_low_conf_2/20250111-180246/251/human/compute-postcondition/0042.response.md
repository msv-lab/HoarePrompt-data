The code snippet `m = int(data[idx + 1])` updates the variable `m` to be the integer value of the element in the list `data` at the index `idx + 1`. All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

- `data` is a list with at least 3 elements.
- `idx` is updated to `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1)`.
- `low` is updated to a value less than or equal to `high`.
- `high` is updated to a value greater than or equal to `low`.
- `mid` is the last calculated midpoint.
- `answer` is the value of `mid` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, or `max(n, m) * 20` if no such `mid` exists.
- `p` is equal to `answer`.
- `q` is `1`.
- `q_inv` is `1`.
- `result` is `answer % MOD`.
- `results` is a list with one additional element `result`.

The only change is the value of `m`.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1)`, `low` is updated to a value less than or equal to `high`, `high` is updated to a value greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is the last calculated midpoint, `answer` is the value of `mid` when `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` returns True, or `max(n, m) * 20` if no such `mid` exists, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`**.
