Let's break down the problem step-by-step:

1. **Identify Loop Condition**: The loop condition is `low <= high`.

2. **Analyze Current State**:
   - `data` is a list with at least 3 elements.
   - `idx` is updated to `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`.
   - `results` has one additional element added.
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to true, then `low` is less than or equal to `high - 1` and `mid` is \((low + high - 1) // 2\).
   - Otherwise, `low` is updated to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\) and `mid` remains \((low + high) // 2\).

3. **Determine Next Iteration Condition**:
   - For the loop to continue, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to true, then `low` is already less than or equal to `high - 1`, which means the condition `low <= high` will still hold true.
   - If `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` evaluates to false, then `low` is updated to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\), which implies that `low` will become greater than `high`, breaking the loop.

Given this analysis, for the loop to continue executing, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. Since the loop condition is `low <= high`, and we know that if `func_2` returns true, the condition holds, we only need to ensure that the loop does not terminate due to `func_2` returning false, which would update `low` to \((low + high) // 2 + 1\).

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to make sure that `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

**State Adjustment**:
- Ensure `low` is less than or equal to `high`.

State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`**
