The code `low = mid + 1` assigns the value of `mid + 1` to `low`. We need to determine the value of `mid` first. 

Given the initial state:
- `low` is either `0` or \(((0 + \max(n, m) * 20) // 2) + 1\)
- `high` is \(\max(n, m) * 20\)
- `mid` is either \(\max(n, m) * 10\) or \(\frac{(3 * (\max(n, m) * 20) + 20)}{4}\)

Since `low` and `high` are dependent on \(\max(n, m)\), let's denote \(\max(n, m)\) as \(x\).

If \(mid\) is \(\max(n, m) * 10\):
\[ mid = x * 10 \]
Then,
\[ low = mid + 1 = x * 10 + 1 \]

If \(mid\) is \(\frac{(3 * (\max(n, m) * 20) + 20)}{4}\):
\[ mid = \frac{(3 * (x * 20) + 20)}{4} = \frac{(60x + 20)}{4} = 15x + 5 \]
Then,
\[ low = mid + 1 = 15x + 6 \]

In both cases, the value of `low` changes to `mid + 1`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is greater than 0, `n` is the integer value of `data[idx]`, `m` is an integer value, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `low` is either \(x * 10 + 1\) or \(15x + 6\), `high` is \(x * 20\), `answer` is \(x * 20\), `mid` is either \(x * 10\) or \(15x + 5\), and `func_2(n, m, k, mid)` is the result of the if-else block evaluation.**
