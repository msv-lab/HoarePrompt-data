The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, the function accepts two positive integers `n` and `m` such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^6\), and a positive integer `k` such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\). Additionally, the sum of all `n` and the sum of all `m` do not exceed \(10^6\), and all inputs are integers.

The function has two cases based on the output:

- Case_1: The function returns an error message indicating that the sum of all `n` and `m` exceeds \(10^6\).
- Case_2: The function processes each test case and returns a specific value based on the given inputs `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a parameter `t`, which represents the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts `n`, `m`, and `k` and returns either an error message if the sum of all `n` and `m` exceeds \(10^6\) or a specific value based on the given inputs `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `t`, which is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it accepts `n` and `m` (positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m \leq 10^6\)) and `k` (a positive integer such that \(2 \leq k \leq 10^{12}\)). If the sum of all `n` and `m` exceeds \(10^6\), it returns an error message; otherwise, it processes the inputs and returns a specific value.**
