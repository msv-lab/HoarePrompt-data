The code `low = mid + 1` updates the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is \((low + high) // 2\). Given the initial values, we can substitute these into the expression:

- `low` is \(0\)
- `high` is \(20 \times \max(n, m)\)

Thus, `mid` is:
\[ mid = \left(0 + 20 \times \max(n, m)\right) // 2 = 10 \times \max(n, m) \]

After executing `low = mid + 1`, the new value of `low` is:
\[ low = 10 \times \max(n, m) + 1 \]

All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `low` is `10 * max(n, m) + 1`, `high` is `20 * max(n, m)`, `mid` is `10 * max(n, m)`, `answer` is `20 * max(n, m)`, `p` is equal to `answer`, `q` is `1`, `q_inv` is `1`, `result` is `answer % MOD`, `m` is the integer value of `data[idx + 1]`, `k` is the integer value of `data[idx + 2]`, `results` is a list with one additional element `result`, and `not (func_2(n, m, k, mid))`**
