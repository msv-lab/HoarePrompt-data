`high` is assigned the value of `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` was previously `(low + high) // 2`, so now `high` becomes `((low + high) // 2) - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3 * (num_iterations + 1) + 3`, `results` is a list with one additional element, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is `((low + high) // 2) - 1`, `answer` is `(low + high) // 2`**
