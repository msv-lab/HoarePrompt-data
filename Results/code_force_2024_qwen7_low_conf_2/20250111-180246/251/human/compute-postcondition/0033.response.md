Postcondition: ***`data` is a list with at least 3 elements, `idx` is `idx + 3`, `low` is either 0 or `((0 + high) // 2 + 1) + 1`, `high` is greater than or equal to `low`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `answer` is equal to `mid` (if the condition is met), or `mid` remains unchanged.***

This postcondition covers all possible outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring that the states of the variables are accurately described based on the given conditions and operations.
