The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `steps`. 

- `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the initial height and width of the paper, respectively.
- `k` is a positive integer representing the threshold area.
- `steps` is a non-negative integer representing the number of cutting steps taken.

Case_1: The program returns `True`.

Case_2: The program returns `True`.

Case_3: The program returns `True`.

Case_4: The program returns `True` if `h * w` (where `h` and `w` are the current height and width after `steps` cuts) is less than `k`, otherwise it does not return.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, and `steps`, and return `True` in multiple cases, and also return `True` if the current area (`h * w`) is less than the threshold area `k` after `steps` cuts.
