According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `res` which is an element of the `results` list. The loop will iterate over each element in the `results` list. For the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.

Let's break down the required adjustments:

- `t` is a positive integer, indicating that `results` should contain exactly `t` elements.
- `data` is a list of strings with at least `3 * t` elements (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `idx` is `3 * t + 3` (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `low` is 0 (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `high` is 0 (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `answer` is the smallest value such that `func_2(n, m, k, answer)` is true for each triplet of inputs (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `mid` is the last calculated midpoint (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `p` is equal to `answer` (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `q` is 1 (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `q_inv` is 1 (this is not directly relevant to the loop execution).
- `results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being `answer % MOD`.

For the loop to execute, the `results` list must contain at least one element (which is guaranteed since `t` is a positive integer).

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`results` is a list containing `t` elements, each being `answer % MOD`**
