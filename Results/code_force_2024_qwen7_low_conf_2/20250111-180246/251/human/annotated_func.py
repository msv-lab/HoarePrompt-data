#Overall this is what the function does:The function processes a series of test cases. Each test case consists of three integers \(n\), \(m\), and \(k\). It uses a binary search approach to find the smallest integer \(p\) such that a certain condition defined in `func_2(n, m, k, p)` is met. After determining \(p\), it calculates \(q\) as 1 and \(q^{-1}\) modulo \(10^9 + 7\). Finally, it computes \(p \times q^{-1} \mod 10^9 + 7\) and stores these results in a list. The function then prints each result. If the sum of all \(n\) and \(m\) across all test cases exceeds \(10^6\), the function would encounter an error due to an unhandled condition in the given code.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers representing the initial height and width of the paper, k is a positive integer representing the threshold area, and steps is a non-negative integer representing the number of cutting steps taken.

    h, w = n, m

            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `h` and `w` are integers. `h` is the result of applying the operation `max(value // 2, 1)` repeatedly starting from `n` for each iteration where `h > w`, and `w` is the result of applying the same operation starting from `m` for each iteration where `w >= h`. `k` is a positive integer representing the threshold area, and `steps` is the total number of iterations the loop executed. If after all iterations `h * w >= k`, the function does not return, otherwise it returns True.
    return h * w < k
    #`The program returns True if h * w is less than k, otherwise it does not return
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `steps`. 

- `n` and `m` represent the initial height and width of the paper, respectively.
- `k` represents the threshold area.
- `steps` represents the number of cutting steps taken.

The function repeatedly divides the larger dimension (either height `h` or width `w`) by 2 until either dimension is reduced to 1, ensuring that both dimensions are halved in each step unless one dimension is already smaller than or equal to the other. After `steps` iterations, the function checks if the product of the final height `h` and width `w` is less than the threshold area `k`. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it does not return anything, implying the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `n` or `m` is initially 1, the function will not perform any divisions and will directly check if `1 * 1 < k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the function will return `False` immediately without performing any iterations.
- The function does not handle the case where `steps` is 0. In such a scenario, the function should return `False` because no cuts have been made, and the original dimensions `n` and `m` would be checked against `k`.

In summary, the function returns `True` if the final area after `steps` cuts is less than `k`, and it returns `False` otherwise.
