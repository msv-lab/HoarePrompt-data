The function `func_2` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, and `steps`. 

- `n` and `m` represent the initial height and width of the paper, respectively.
- `k` represents the threshold area.
- `steps` represents the number of cutting steps taken.

The function repeatedly divides the larger dimension (either height `h` or width `w`) by 2 until either dimension is reduced to 1, ensuring that both dimensions are halved in each step unless one dimension is already smaller than or equal to the other. After `steps` iterations, the function checks if the product of the final height `h` and width `w` is less than the threshold area `k`. If it is, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it does not return anything, implying the function returns `False`.

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- If `n` or `m` is initially 1, the function will not perform any divisions and will directly check if `1 * 1 < k`. If `k` is greater than or equal to 1, the function will return `False` immediately without performing any iterations.
- The function does not handle the case where `steps` is 0. In such a scenario, the function should return `False` because no cuts have been made, and the original dimensions `n` and `m` would be checked against `k`.

In summary, the function returns `True` if the final area after `steps` cuts is less than `k`, and it returns `False` otherwise.
