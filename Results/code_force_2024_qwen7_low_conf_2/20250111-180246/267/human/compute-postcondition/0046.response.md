Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `count` is `(count - result) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` where `result` is `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`, and `l` is `l + 1` since the condition `count == d` is met and there is no else part in the code.***
