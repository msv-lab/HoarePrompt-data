Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks; `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` is `(count - result) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` where `result` is `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`, and `l` is `l + 1` since there is no else part, this condition always applies.***
