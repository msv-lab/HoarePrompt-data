Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify Loop Variables and Conditions**:
   - The loop variable is `l`.
   - The loop runs from `0` to `n - 2 * d - 1`.
   - The condition `n - 2 * d` must be non-negative for the loop to execute.

2. **Current States**:
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, or 0 if no such iteration occurred.
   - `count` is the sum of 1 for each character in the range specified by `d` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns `True`.
   - `d` is `d_end + 1`.

3. **Determine Necessary Adjustments**:
   - For the loop to execute, `n - 2 * d` must be non-negative. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is sufficiently large compared to `2 * d`.
   - Since `d` is `d_end + 1`, we need to know the value of `d_end` to determine `d`.

4. **Summary of Necessary Adjustments**:
   - Ensure `n` is greater than `2 * d` (or equivalently, `d_end + 1`).

Given these points, the states that need to be adjusted are:

- `n` must be greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`.
- `d` is already correctly defined as `d_end + 1`.

Therefore, the final state to be adjusted is:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 2 * (d_end + 1), `max_length` is the maximum value of 2 * d when count equals d during any iteration, or 0 if no such iteration occurred, `count` is the sum of 1 for each character in the range specified by d where func_2(s[i], s[i + d]) returns True, `d` is d_end + 1**
