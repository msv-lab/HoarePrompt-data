Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` is the final value of `count` after the loop, `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over the string `s` with a step size of 1, starting from index 0 up to `n - 2 * d`.
- For each iteration, the `count` is updated based on whether certain conditions are met (`func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` and `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`).
- If `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `max_length` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`.
- After the loop completes, `count` will hold the final value of `count` after all iterations, and `d` will remain `d_end + 1`.

Since the loop does not change `n` and `s` directly within the loop, these values remain as initially provided. The values of `max_length`, `count`, and `d` are determined by the operations inside the loop.
