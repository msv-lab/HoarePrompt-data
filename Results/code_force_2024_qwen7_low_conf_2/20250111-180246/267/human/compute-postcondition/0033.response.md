The code updates `max_length` to be the maximum value between its current value and `2 * d`. Given the initial conditions:

- `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d_end + 1`, or `0` if no such iteration occurred.
- `count` equals `d_end + 1`.
- `d` equals `d_end + 1`.

Since both `count` and `d` are equal to `d_end + 1`, `2 * d` is updated to `2 * (d_end + 1)`. This new value of `2 * d` will replace the current value of `max_length` because it is the maximum value encountered.

Therefore, the updated `max_length` is `2 * (d_end + 1)`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `count` equals `d_end + 1`, `d` equals `d_end + 1`, and `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` has returned `True` at least `d` times (and `l` is greater than `0`).**
