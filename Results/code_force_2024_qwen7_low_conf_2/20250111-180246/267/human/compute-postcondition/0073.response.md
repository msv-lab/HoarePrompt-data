The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and the length of `s` is at most 5000. The function returns `max_length`, which is the maximum value of 2 * `d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration of the loop, or 0 if no such iteration occurred.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return the maximum value of 2 * `d` under specified conditions, or 0 if no such condition is met.
