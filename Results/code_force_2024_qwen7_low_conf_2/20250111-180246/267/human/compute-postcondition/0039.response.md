The code `max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)` updates the value of `max_length` to be the maximum between its current value and `2 * d`. 

From the initial state, we know that:
- `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration.
- `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`.

Since `2 * d` is equal to `2 * (d_end + 1)`, the new value of `max_length` will be `max(max_length, 2 * (d_end + 1))`.

Given that `max_length` is already `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` during any iteration, the new value of `max_length` will remain unchanged because `2 * (d_end + 1)` is the same as the current value of `max_length`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` is `count + 1`, `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`, and `max_length` remains unchanged.**
