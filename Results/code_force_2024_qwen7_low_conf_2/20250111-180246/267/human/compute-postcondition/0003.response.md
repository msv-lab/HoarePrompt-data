The code snippet updates the value of `count` based on a function call `func_2` applied to characters in the string `s` with a step of `d`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined, and the value of `d` is not specified. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `count` without knowing these details. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be greater than 0, `max_length` is 0, `count` is the sum of 1 for each character in the range specified by `d` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns True.**
