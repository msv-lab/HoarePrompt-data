The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, and its length is between 1 and 5000 (inclusive). After executing the function body, the function returns `max_len`, which is the length of the longest matching substring found in `s` where a matching substring can be formed by replacing any '?' with any lowercase Latin letter.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and return the length of the longest matching substring where '?' can be replaced with any lowercase Latin letter.
