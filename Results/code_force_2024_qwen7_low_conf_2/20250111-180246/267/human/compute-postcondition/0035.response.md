To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions and variables involved:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `l < n - 2 * d`.
2. **Variables at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`.
   - `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration.
   - `count` equals `d_end + 1`.
   - `d` equals `d_end + 1`.
   - `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` has returned `True` at least `d` times.

Since the loop runs from `l` starting at `0` up to `n - 2 * d - 1`, the new value of `l` at the start of the next iteration will be `l + 1`.

Now, let's consider the changes needed:

- **`l`**: It will increment by 1.
- **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`max_length`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`count`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`d`**: Remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- **`func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`**: This function call needs to be evaluated for the new `l`.

Given these points, the new state at the start of the next iteration is:

- `l` is incremented by 1.
- `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` needs to return `True` at least `d` times.

So, the updated state is:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` equals `d_end + 1`, `d` equals `d_end + 1`, and `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` has returned `True` at least `d` times, where `l` is now `l + 1`.**
