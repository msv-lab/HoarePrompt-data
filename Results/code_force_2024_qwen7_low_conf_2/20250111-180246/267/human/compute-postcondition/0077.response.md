The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `s`, `max_len`, `match_count`, and `i`. It simply breaks out of the current loop or conditional statement context, but since no such context is explicitly given, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is the maximum of its original value and `sub_len`, `match_count` is `match_count + 1`, `i` is `len(s) // 2 + 3` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
