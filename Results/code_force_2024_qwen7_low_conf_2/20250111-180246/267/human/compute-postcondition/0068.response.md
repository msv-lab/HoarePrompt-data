The code snippet updates `max_length` to the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`. Given the initial conditions:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` remains greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\).
- `d` remains \(d_{end} + 2\).
- `max_length` remains unchanged.
- `count` is updated by adding either `func_2(s[l + d_{end} + 2 - 1], s[l + 2 \times d_{end} + 3 - 1])` or `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 \times d - 1])` to its current value, depending on whether `l` is greater than 0.
- `l` is updated to `l + 1` if `l` is greater than 0.

The line of code `max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)` simply updates `max_length` to the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`.

Since `d` remains \(d_{end} + 2\), `2 * d` will be \(2 \times (d_{end} + 2) = 2 \times d_{end} + 4\).

The output state will be:
- `s` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` remains greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\).
- `d` remains \(d_{end} + 2\).
- `max_length` is now the maximum of its original value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\).
- `count` remains unchanged.
- `l` remains unchanged if `l` was not greater than 0, otherwise `l` is updated to `l + 1`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks; `n` remains greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\); `d` remains \(d_{end} + 2\); `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\); `count` remains unchanged; `l` remains unchanged if `l` was not greater than 0, otherwise `l` is updated to `l + 1`.**
