Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, `l` is incremented by 1, `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from its original value and then adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` if `l > 0`, and `max_length` remains the same whether `count == d` or not.***
