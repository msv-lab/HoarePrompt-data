Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\).
   - `d` is \(d_{end} + 2\).
   - `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\).
   - `count` is updated by adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` to its current value.
   - `l` is `l + 1`.
   - If `count` equals `d`, `max_length` is set to \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\).

2. **Loop Execution**: The loop runs from `l` = 0 to `n - 2 * d`.

3. **State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `s` is unchanged.
   - `n` remains greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\).
   - `d` remains \(d_{end} + 2\).
   - `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\).
   - `count` is updated by adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` to its current value.
   - `l` is incremented by 1.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - `l` is increased by 1 from the previous value.
   - For the loop to continue, `l` must be less than \(n - 2 \times d\).

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `l` is increased by 1, we need to update `l` to `l + 1`.
   - We need to check if `l + 1` is still within the range of \(n - 2 \times d\).

Let's summarize the updated states:

- `s` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\).
- `d` remains \(d_{end} + 2\).
- `max_length` remains the maximum value between its current value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\).
- `count` is updated based on the new value of `l + 1`.
- `l` is updated to `l + 1`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\), `d` is \(d_{end} + 2\), `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\), `count` is updated by adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` to its current value, and `l` is `l + 1`.**
