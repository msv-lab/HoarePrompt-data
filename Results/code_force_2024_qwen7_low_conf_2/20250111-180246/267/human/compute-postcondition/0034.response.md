Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` equals `d_end + 1`, and `d` equals `d_end + 1`. Furthermore, `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` has returned `True` at least `d` times (assuming `l` is greater than `0`). If the condition `count == d` is not met, the values of `max_length`, `count`, and `d` remain as they were before the if statement.***
