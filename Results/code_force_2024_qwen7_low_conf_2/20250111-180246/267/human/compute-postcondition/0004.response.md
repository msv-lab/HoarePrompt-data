Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop runs for `l` in the range `range(n - 2 * d)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `l` is less than `n - 2 * d`.

2. **Initial State Variables**:
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` must be greater than 0.
   - `max_length` is 0.
   - `count` is the sum of 1 for each character in the range specified by `d` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns True.

3. **Loop Execution Requirement**:
   - For the loop to execute, the condition `l < n - 2 * d` must be true.
   - This implies that `n - 2 * d` must be greater than 0, ensuring there are valid values of `l` to iterate over.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - Since `n` must be greater than 0 (already given), we need to ensure that `n - 2 * d` is positive.
   - Additionally, since the loop will increment `l`, the initial value of `l` should be considered, which is typically 0 unless otherwise specified.

Given this analysis, we need to adjust the following states to ensure the loop can execute:
- `n` must be greater than 0 (which is already given).
- `n - 2 * d` must be greater than 0.
- The initial value of `l` should be 0.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` must be greater than 0, `l` is 0, `max_length` is 0, `count` is the sum of 1 for each character in the range specified by `d` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns True.**
