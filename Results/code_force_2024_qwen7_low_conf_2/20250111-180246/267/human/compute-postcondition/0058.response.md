According to the given code, the loop condition for the `for` loop is `l < n - 2 * d`. At the end of the previous iteration, the following states hold:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks
- `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\)
- `d` is \(d_{end} + 2\)
- `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\)
- `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`
- `l` is greater than 0

For the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `l` must satisfy `l < n - 2 * d`.

Since `l` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, we need to adjust the value of `l` to be `l + 1`. The other variables should remain the same unless there is an update within the loop body, but based on the information provided, no such updates are mentioned.

Therefore, the new value of `l` will be `l + 1`, and since `n` and `d` do not change, the new value of `n - 2 * d` remains the same. The loop will continue if `l + 1` is still less than `n - 2 * d`.

Given this, the adjusted states are:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks
- `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\)
- `d` is \(d_{end} + 2\)
- `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\)
- `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`
- `l` is greater than 0 and now becomes `l + 1`

The final state after adjusting for the next iteration is:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\), `d` is \(d_{end} + 2\), `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\), `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, and `l` is greater than 0 and now becomes `l + 1`**.
