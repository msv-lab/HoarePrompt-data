Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial States:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0.
- `l` is `current_l + 1` (let's denote this as `l` for simplicity).
- `count` is updated based on the conditions provided.
- `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `2 * d` if `count == d`.

### Loop Condition:
The loop runs for `l` in the range `n - 2 * d`.

### End of Previous Iteration:
- The loop ends when `l` reaches the current value of `l - 1`.

### Next Iteration:
For the loop to execute one more time, `l` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value of `l` will be `l + 1`.

### Updating States:
- `l` will become `l + 1`.
- The other states (`s`, `n`, `d`, `count`, `max_length`) should remain unchanged unless there are specific conditions that affect them.

### Conditions for Updating `count`:
- `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` if `l > 0`.

Since `l` is incremented by 1, the condition `l > 0` will still hold true (assuming `l` was within the valid range before the increment). Therefore, the update to `count` will be applied based on the new value of `l`.

### Conditions for Updating `max_length`:
- `max_length` is updated to `max(max_length, 2 * d)` if `count == d`.

This condition does not directly depend on `l` but rather on the value of `count`. Since `count` is updated based on the new value of `l`, we need to consider the new `count` value.

### Final Adjusted States:
- `s` remains unchanged.
- `n` remains unchanged.
- `d` remains unchanged.
- `l` becomes `l + 1`.
- `count` is updated based on the new value of `l`.
- `max_length` is updated based on the new value of `count`.

### Conclusion:
At the start of the next iteration, the states need to be adjusted as follows:

**State:**
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0.
- `l` is `l + 1`.
- `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1]) if `l > 0`, otherwise the values remain unchanged.
- `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `2 * d` if `count == d`.

So, the final answer is:

**State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, `l` is `l + 1`, `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1]) if `l > 0`, otherwise the values remain unchanged, and `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `2 * d` if `count == d`.**
