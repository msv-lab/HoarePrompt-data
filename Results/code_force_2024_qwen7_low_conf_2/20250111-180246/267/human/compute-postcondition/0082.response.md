Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `max_len` is the length of the longest matching substring found in `s` where a matching substring can be formed by replacing any '?' with any lowercase Latin letter, `match_count` is 0, `sub_len` is 1, and `i` is `len(s) - sub_len`.**

Explanation:
- After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `max_len` will be the length of the longest matching substring found in the string `s` considering `?` as a wildcard.
- The loop runs from `sub_len` starting from half the length of `s` down to 1. For each `sub_len`, it checks substrings of length `sub_len` in `s` and counts how many characters match (including `?` acting as a wildcard).
- If a match of length `sub_len` is found, it updates `max_len` to `sub_len` and breaks out of the inner loop.
- After the loop completes, `sub_len` will be 1 (since the loop starts from `len(s) // 2` and decrements until 1).
- `match_count` will be 0 because the loop would only set `match_count` to a non-zero value if a full match of length `sub_len` was found.
- `i` will be `len(s) - sub_len` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches `len(s) - sub_len`.

This ensures that after all iterations, `max_len` contains the length of the longest valid matching substring.
