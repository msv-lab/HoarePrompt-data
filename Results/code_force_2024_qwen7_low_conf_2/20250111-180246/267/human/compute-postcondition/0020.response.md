Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0.
   - `l` is `l + 1`.
   - `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from its original value.
   - `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `2 * d` if `count == d`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The code updates `count` by adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The value of `s`, `n`, and `d` remain unchanged.
   - `l` is updated to `l + 1`.
   - `count` is updated to its previous value plus `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.
   - `max_length` remains unchanged unless `count == d`, in which case it would be updated to `max(max_length, 2 * d)`. However, since the condition `count == d` is not specified in the current state and no value for `count` is given, we assume it does not change.

Given the steps, the output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, `l` is `l + 1`, `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from its original value and then adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, and `max_length` remains the same if `count != d` or is updated to `max(max_length, 2 * d)` if `count == d`**.
