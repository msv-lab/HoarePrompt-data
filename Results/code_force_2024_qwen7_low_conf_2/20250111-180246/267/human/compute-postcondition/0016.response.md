The code snippet updates the `max_length` variable to be the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`. The values of `s`, `n`, `d`, `l`, and `count` remain unchanged from their initial states.

The impact on the variables is as follows:
- `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`.

The output state is:

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, `l` is `current_l + 1`, `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1]) if `l > 0`, otherwise the values remain unchanged, and `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `2 * d`.**
