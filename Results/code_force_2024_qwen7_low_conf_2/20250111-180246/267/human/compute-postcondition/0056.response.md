The code updates `max_length` to be the maximum value between its current value and `2 * d`. Given the initial state:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks
- `n` is greater than `2 \times (d_{end} + 1)`
- `d` is `d_{end} + 2`
- `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 \times d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration
- `count` is equal to `d`
- `l` is greater than 0
- `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`

The line `max_length = max(max_length, 2 * d)` updates `max_length` to the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`. Since `d` is defined as `d_{end} + 2`, `2 * d` is `2 * (d_{end} + 2)`, which simplifies to `2 * d_end + 4`.

The output state will be:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks
- `n` is greater than `2 \times (d_{end} + 1)`
- `d` is `d_{end} + 2`
- `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and `2 * d` (which is `2 * d_end + 4`)
- `count` is equal to `d`
- `l` is greater than 0
- `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 \times (d_{end} + 1)`, `d` is `d_{end} + 2`, `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and `2 * d_end + 4`, `count` is equal to `d`, `l` is greater than 0, and `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])**
