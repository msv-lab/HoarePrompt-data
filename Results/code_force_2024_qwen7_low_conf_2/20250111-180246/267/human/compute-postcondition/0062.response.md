The code snippet updates the `max_length` variable by setting it to the maximum value between its current value and `2 * d`. Given the initial state, the values of `d` and `max_length` are already set, and the other variables (`s`, `n`, `d_end`, `count`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The initial state includes `d` which is equal to \(d_{end} + 2\).
2. `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and \(2 \times d\). Since \(d\) is \(d_{end} + 2\), \(2 \times d\) is \(2 \times (d_{end} + 2) = 2 \times d_{end} + 4\).
3. The code sets `max_length` to the maximum of its current value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\).

Given that `max_length` is initially the maximum value between its current value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\), the new value of `max_length` will be \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\) because \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\) is the upper bound defined in the condition.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `max_length` is now \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\)
- All other variables (`s`, `n`, `d_end`, `count`, and `l`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\), `d` is \(d_{end} + 2\), `max_length` is \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\), `count` is updated by adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` to its current value, and `l` is `l + 1`.**
