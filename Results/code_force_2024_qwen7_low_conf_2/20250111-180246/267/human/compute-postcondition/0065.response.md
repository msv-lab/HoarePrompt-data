Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\), `d` is \(d_{end} + 2\), `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\), `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from its current value, and `l` is `l + 1`.**
