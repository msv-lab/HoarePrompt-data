Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States:**
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\).
   - `max_length` is the maximum value of \(2 \times d\) when `count` equals `d` during any iteration.
   - `count` is the final value of `count` after the loop.
   - `d` is equal to \(d_{end} + 1\).

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `d` from `1` to `n // 2 + 1`.

3. **Current State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `d` is equal to \(d_{end} + 1\).
   - Since the loop has just completed its previous iteration, the next value of `d` would be \(d_{end} + 2\).

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - The variable `d` will increment by 1, so the new value of `d` will be \(d_{end} + 2\).
   - The variable `count` remains the same as it is the final value from the previous iteration.
   - `max_length` does not change because it is determined based on the values of `d` and `count` during the loop, and we haven't processed any new `d` yet.
   - The string `s` and the value of `n` remain unchanged.

5. **New States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `d` becomes \(d_{end} + 2\).
   - `n` remains greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\).
   - `max_length` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `count` remains the same as it was at the end of the previous iteration.
   - `d_end` is now \(d_{end} + 1\), but this is an internal state that gets updated at the start of each iteration, so we don't explicitly state it here.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop are:

**State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\), `max_length` is the maximum value of \(2 \times d\) when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` is the final value of `count` after the loop, `d` is equal to \(d_{end} + 2\)**.
