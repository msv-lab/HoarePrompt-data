Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`.
   - `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration.
   - `count` is incremented by 1, so `count = count + 1`.
   - `d` is set to `d_end + 1`.
   - `max_length` remains unchanged.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `l < n - 2 * d`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration**:
   - The variable `l` is incremented at the end of each iteration, so after the previous iteration, `l` is one more than its value at the start of the previous iteration.
   - The condition for the loop to continue is `l < n - 2 * d`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must still be true.

Given that `count` is incremented by 1 and `d` is set to `d_end + 1`, we need to check if the new values of `count` and `d` affect the loop condition.

4. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `l` is incremented at the end of the iteration, `l` becomes `l + 1` after the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to continue, the new value of `l` should still satisfy the condition `l < n - 2 * d`.
   - The values of `s`, `max_length`, `count`, and `d` remain unchanged from the previous iteration, except for `l` which is now `l + 1`.

5. **Final State**:
   - `s` remains the same.
   - `max_length` remains the same.
   - `count` is `count + 1`.
   - `d` is `d_end + 1`.
   - `l` is `l + 1`.

To ensure the loop continues, the new value of `l` (`l + 1`) must still be less than `n - 2 * d`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` is `count + 1`, `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`, and `l` is `l + 1`**.
