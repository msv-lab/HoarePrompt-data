The value of `count` is incremented by the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. Given the precondition, `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` has returned `True` at least `d` times, meaning its value is `1`. Therefore, `count` is increased by `1`.

Let's denote the new value of `count` as `count + 1`.

- `s` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` remains greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`.
- `max_length` remains either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration.
- `count` changes to `count + 1`.
- `d` remains equal to `d_end + 1`.
- `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` continues to return `True` at least `d` times.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` is `count + 1`, `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`, and `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` has returned `True` at least `d` times.**
