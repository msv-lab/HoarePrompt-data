`count` is incremented by the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. Since `func_2` is not defined in the provided code, we cannot determine its exact return value. However, we know that `count` will be updated by this value.

The preconditions state that `l` is greater than 0, so `l + d - 1` and `l + 2 * d - 1` are valid indices for the string `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 \times (d_{end} + 1)`, `d` is `d_{end} + 2`, `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 \times d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, `l` is greater than 0**
