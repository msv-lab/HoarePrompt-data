The code updates the value of `count` by adding the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`. From the initial state:

- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`.
- `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration.
- `count` is `count - result` where `result` is `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.
- `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`.
- `l` is `l + 1`.

After executing the line `count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`:

- The new value of `count` will be the previous value of `count` minus `result` plus the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks; `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` is `(count - result) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` where `result` is `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`, and `l` is `l + 1`**.
