Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\), `d` is \(d_{end} + 2\), `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\), `count` is updated by adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` to its current value, and `l` is `l + 1`. If `count` equals `d`, `max_length` is set to \(2 \times d_{end} + 4\). Otherwise, the values remain as per the if part.***
