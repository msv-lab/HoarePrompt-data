`match_count` is incremented by 1. The value of `s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is the maximum of its original value and `sub_len`, and `i` is `len(s) // 2 + 3`. The `match_count` variable is updated, but the values of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is the maximum of its original value and `sub_len`, `match_count` is `match_count + 1`, `i` is `len(s) // 2 + 3`**
