To ensure the for loop can execute, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop can run based on the given state before the loop starts. Let's break down the necessary adjustments:

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop runs as long as `l < n - 2 * d`. Given that `n > 2 \times (d_{end} + 1)` and `d = d_{end} + 2`, we need to ensure that `n - 2 * d` is a positive number.

2. **Variable `l`**: Before the loop starts, `l` should be initialized to 0 since the loop starts from `l = 0`.

3. **Variables `n` and `d`**: We need to ensure that `n` and `d` are set correctly such that `n - 2 * d` is positive. This means `n` should be greater than `2 * d`.

4. **Other Variables**: The other variables like `max_length`, `count`, and `s` do not directly affect the loop's ability to run, but they might influence the loop body. However, their initial values don't need adjustment specifically for the loop to execute.

Let's summarize the required adjustments:

- `l` should be 0.
- `n` should be greater than `2 * d`.
- `d` should be set to `d_{end} + 2`.

Given the provided state and these considerations, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 \times (d_{end} + 1)`, `d` is `d_{end} + 2`, `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 \times d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` is the sum of 1 for each index `i` in the range from `0` to `d-1` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` is true, `l` is 0**
