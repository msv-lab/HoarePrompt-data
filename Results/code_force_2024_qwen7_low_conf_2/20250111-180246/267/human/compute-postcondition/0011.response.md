Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, `l` is a non-negative integer, and `max_length` is either 2 * d if `count` equals `d`, or 0 otherwise. `count` is the sum of 1 for each character in the range specified by `d` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns True, considering the case when `l` is greater than 0, `count` is incremented by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1]).***
