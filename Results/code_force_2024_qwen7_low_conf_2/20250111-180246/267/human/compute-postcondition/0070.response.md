Let's analyze the loop and derive the final state after all iterations of the loop have finished.

### Initial State Recap:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\).
- `max_length` is the maximum value of \(2 \times d\) when `count` equals `d` during any iteration.
- `count` is the sum of 1 for each index `i` in the range from `0` to `d-1` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` is true.
- `d` is equal to \(d_{end} + 2\).

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over the range `n - 2 * d`. Given `d = d_{end} + 2`, the loop runs until `l` reaches `n - 2 \times (d_{end} + 2)`.

#### Key Points in the Loop:
1. **Update of `count`:**
   - If `l > 0`, `count` is adjusted by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` and adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.
2. **Update of `max_length`:**
   - If `count` equals `d`, `max_length` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`.

### Iterations Analysis:
After analyzing the output states for the first few iterations, we observe:
- `max_length` is always updated based on the condition `count == d`.
- `count` is updated based on the function `func_2` evaluations.
- `d` and `n` remain unchanged throughout the loop.

### Final Output State:
Since the loop runs until `l` reaches `n - 2 \times (d_{end} + 2)`, the loop will eventually cover all possible substrings of length `2 \times d` in the string `s`.

Given that the loop updates `max_length` only when `count == d`, the final value of `max_length` will be the maximum value of `2 \times d` found during any iteration where `count` equals `d`.

### Conclusion:
The loop will run until it has checked all possible substrings of length `2 \times d` in the string `s`. Therefore, the final value of `max_length` will be the maximum value of `2 \times d` found during these checks.

**Output State:**
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\), `max_length` is the maximum value of \(2 \times d\) found during any iteration where `count` equals `d`, `d` is \(d_{end} + 2\), and `count` and `l` are dependent on the specific substring being evaluated.**
