`count` is decremented by the result of the function `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`. The specific values of `s`, `l`, `d`, and `count` are not provided, but we know that `l` is `current_l + 1`. The value of `count` after decrementing will be `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.

The output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, `l` is `current_l + 1`, and `count` is `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.**
