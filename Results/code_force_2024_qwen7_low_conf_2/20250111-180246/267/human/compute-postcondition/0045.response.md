The code snippet updates `max_length` to be the maximum of its current value and `2 * d`. Given the initial conditions:

- `n > 2 * (d_end + 1)`
- `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration
- `count` is `(count - result) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` where `result` is `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`
- `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`
- `l` is `l + 1`

Since the code only updates `max_length` and does not affect the other variables, the new value of `max_length` will be the maximum of its current value and `2 * (d_end + 1)`.

Given that `d` is `d_end + 1`, the expression `2 * d` simplifies to `2 * (d_end + 1)`.

Therefore, the new value of `max_length` will be the maximum of its original value and `2 * (d_end + 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `count` is `(count - result) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` where `result` is `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`, and `l` is `l + 1`**
