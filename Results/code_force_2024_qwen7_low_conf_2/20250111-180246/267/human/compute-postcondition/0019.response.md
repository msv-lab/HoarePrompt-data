The code `count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` impacts the `count` variable by subtracting the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from `count`. The `s`, `n`, `d`, `l`, and `max_length` variables are not affected.

Given the initial conditions:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0.
- `l` is `l + 1`.
- `count` is updated according to the condition `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` if `l > 0`, otherwise the values remain unchanged.
- `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `2 * d` if `count == d`.

After executing the code `count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`:
- `count` is updated by subtracting the value of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from its current value.
- `s`, `n`, `d`, `l`, and `max_length` remain unchanged based on their initial conditions.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, `l` is `l + 1`, `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from its original value, and `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `2 * d` if `count == d`.**
