Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. It iterates over possible substring lengths in descending order, checking for matches where '?' can be replaced with any lowercase Latin letter. For each possible length, it checks all substrings of that length to see if they match, considering '?' as any character. If a matching substring is found, it updates the `max_len` variable to store the length of the longest matching substring found. After completing the iterations, the function returns `max_len`, which is the length of the longest matching substring where '?' can be replaced with any lowercase Latin letter.**

This summary includes the potential edge case where no matching substrings are found, in which case `max_len` would remain 0. Additionally, it covers the fact that the function considers all substrings of decreasing lengths starting from half the length of `s` down to 1, ensuring all possible matching substrings are checked.
