Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, or 0 if no such iteration occurred.
   - `count` is the sum of 1 for each character in the range specified by `d` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns True.

2. **Loop Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over `d` from 1 to `n // 2 + 1`.
   - For each `d`, the loop body (which is omitted) updates the `count` based on the condition `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])`.

3. **Key Variables**:
   - `d` is incremented in each iteration.
   - `count` is updated within the loop body based on the condition `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])`.
   - `max_length` is updated if `2 * d` is greater than the current `max_length`.

4. **State Transition**:
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `d` was some value `d_end`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `d` must be increased to `d_end + 1`.
   - `count` and `max_length` will depend on the new value of `d`.

5. **Adjusting States**:
   - Since `d` is incremented, `d` becomes `d_end + 1`.
   - `count` and `max_length` will be updated based on the new value of `d`.

6. **New State**:
   - `d` must be `d_end + 1`.
   - `count` and `max_length` will be updated based on the new `d`.

Given the previous state where `d` was some value, let's denote it as `d_end`. For the loop to execute one more time, `d` should be `d_end + 1`.

Therefore, the new state for the loop to execute one more time is:

**State: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, or 0 if no such iteration occurred, `count` is the sum of 1 for each character in the range specified by `d` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns True, considering the updates made during the loop, and `d` is `d_end + 1`.**

To generalize, if `d_end` was the previous value of `d`:

**State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, or 0 if no such iteration occurred, `count` is the sum of 1 for each character in the range specified by `d` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns True, considering the updates made during the loop, and `d` is `d_end + 1`.**
