Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, `l` is `current_l + 1`, `count` is updated to `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1]) if `l > 0`, otherwise the values remain unchanged, and `max_length` is the maximum of its original value and `2 * d` if `count == d`.***
