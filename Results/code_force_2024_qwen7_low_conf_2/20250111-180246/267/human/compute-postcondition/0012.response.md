Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
   - `n` is greater than 0.
   - `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, meaning `n > 2 * d`.
   - `l` is a non-negative integer.
   - `max_length` is either 2 * d if `count` equals `d`, or 0 otherwise.
   - `count` is the sum of 1 for each character in the range specified by `d` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns True, considering the case when `l` is greater than 0, `count` is incremented by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop runs over `l` from `0` to `n - 2 * d - 1`.
   - For each iteration, `l` is incremented by 1.

3. **Current State at the End of Previous Iteration**:
   - We need to determine the new state for the next iteration of the loop.

4. **Next Iteration**:
   - At the end of the current iteration, `l` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, the new value of `l` will be `current_l + 1`.
   - The condition for the loop to continue executing is `l < n - 2 * d`.

5. **Adjusting the States**:
   - `s` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
   - `n` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
   - `n - 2 * d` remains unchanged since the loop does not modify it.
   - `max_length` remains unchanged unless `count` changes, but we do not know if `count` will change in this iteration, so we assume `max_length` remains the same.
   - `count` might change if `func_2(s[current_l + d - 1], s[current_l + 2 * d - 1])` returns True, but we do not have the details of `func_2`'s implementation, so we assume `count` remains the same unless specified otherwise.
   - `l` will be incremented by 1.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, `l` is `current_l + 1`, and `max_length` is either 2 * d if `count` equals `d`, or 0 otherwise. `count` remains the same as the previous iteration.**
