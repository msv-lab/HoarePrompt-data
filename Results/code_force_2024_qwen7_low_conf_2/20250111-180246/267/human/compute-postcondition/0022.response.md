The code snippet updates `max_length` by taking the maximum value between `max_length` and `2 * d`. Given the initial state, `max_length` remains the same unless `count == d`, in which case `max_length` would be updated to `max(max_length, 2 * d)`. Since the code does not change the value of `count`, `max_length` stays the same.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, `l` is `l + 1`, `count` is updated by subtracting `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` from its original value and then adding `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` if `l > 0`, and `max_length` remains the same.**
