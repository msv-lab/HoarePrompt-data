Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks. `n` remains greater than \(2 \times (d_{end} + 1)\). `d` remains \(d_{end} + 2\). `max_length` remains unchanged. `count` is updated by adding either `func_2(s[l + d_{end} + 2 - 1], s[l + 2 \times d_{end} + 3 - 1])` or `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 \times d - 1])` to its current value, depending on whether `l` is greater than 0. `l` is updated to `l + 1` if `l` is greater than 0.***
