Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 \times (d_{end} + 1)`, `d` is `d_{end} + 2`, `max_length` is the maximum value between its current value and `2 * d_end + 4`, `count` is updated by `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`, and `l` is greater than 0. If `count` equals `d`, then `max_length` is updated to be the maximum value between its current value and `2 * d`.***
