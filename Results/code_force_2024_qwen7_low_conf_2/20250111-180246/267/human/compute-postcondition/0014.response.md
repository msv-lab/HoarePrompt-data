The code `count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` updates the value of `count` by adding the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` to it. 

From the initial state, we know:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is greater than 0.
- `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0.
- `l` is `current_l + 1`.
- `count` is `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`.

Since the exact value of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `count`. However, we can express the updated value of `count` in terms of its previous value.

Let's denote the result of `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` as `value`. Therefore, the new value of `count` will be `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + value`.

Thus, the updated state of the variables is:
- `s` remains a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` remains greater than 0.
- `n - 2 * d` remains greater than 0.
- `l` remains `current_l + 1`.
- `count` is now `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` is greater than 0, `l` is `current_l + 1`, `count` is `count - func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d]) + func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])**
