The code subtracts 1 from `count` where `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` is assumed to be `True`. However, the function `func_2` is not defined, so we cannot determine its exact value without more information. Since the function is assumed to return `True`, we know that `count` is decremented by 1. 

Given the initial conditions, the only affected variable is `count`. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `d`, `l`, `max_length`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` must be greater than 0, `n - 2 * d` must be greater than 0, `l` is greater than 0, `max_length` is 0, `count` is the sum of 1 for each character in the range specified by `d` where `func_2(s[i], s[i + d])` returns `True`, `count` is decreased by 1.**
