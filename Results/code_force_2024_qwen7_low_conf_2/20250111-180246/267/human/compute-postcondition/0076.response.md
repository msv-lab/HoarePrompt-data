`max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value (`max_len`) and `sub_len`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is the maximum of its original value and `sub_len`, `match_count` is `match_count + 1`, `i` is `len(s) // 2 + 3`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is the maximum of its original value and `sub_len`, `match_count` is `match_count + 1`, `i` is `len(s) // 2 + 3`**
