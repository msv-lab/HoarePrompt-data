Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is the maximum of its original value and `sub_len`, `match_count` is either incremented by 1 if the condition `s[i] == s[i + sub_len] or s[i] == '?' or s[i + sub_len] == '?'` is true, or reset to 0 if the condition is false, `i` is `len(s) // 2 + 3`.***
