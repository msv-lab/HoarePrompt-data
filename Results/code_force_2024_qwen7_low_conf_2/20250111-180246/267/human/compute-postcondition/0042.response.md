The code updates the value of `count` by subtracting the result of `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`. Since the exact behavior of `func_2` is not specified, we will denote its return value as `result`.

From the initial state:
- `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`.
- `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration.
- `count` is incremented by 1 in the previous line before this code.
- `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`.
- `l` is `l + 1`.

The updated state after executing the line `count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])` will be:
- `count` is now `count - result`.
- All other variables remain unchanged from their initial states.

Therefore, the Output State is:
**`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks; `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is either `2 * (d_end + 1)` or the maximum value of `2 * d` when `count` equals `d` during any iteration, `count` is `count - result` where `result` is `func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])`, `d` is equal to `d_end + 1`, and `l` is `l + 1`**.
