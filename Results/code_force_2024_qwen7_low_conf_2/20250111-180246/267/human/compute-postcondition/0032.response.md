Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks, `n` is greater than `2 * (d_end + 1)`, `max_length` is the maximum value of `2 * d` when count equals `d` during any iteration, or `0` if no such iteration occurred, `count` equals `d_end + 1`, `d` equals `d_end + 1`, and `func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])` has returned `True` at least `d` times (and `l` is greater than `0`)***
