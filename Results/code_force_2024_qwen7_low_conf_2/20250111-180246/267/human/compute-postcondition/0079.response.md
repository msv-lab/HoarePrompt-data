The code assigns the value `0` to the variable `match_count`. The other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, the `match_count` is updated to `0`, while the other variables retain their initial values.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `max_len` is the maximum of its original value and `sub_len`, `match_count` is 0, `i` is `len(s) // 2 + 3`**
