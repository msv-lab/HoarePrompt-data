Reasoning:
- The provided program aims to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat substring in a given string `s` where `s` consists of lowercase Latin letters and/or question marks.
- The program iterates through possible tandem repeats using two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` checks if two characters (or a character and a question mark) match, which is a critical part of determining tandem repeats.
- `func_1` iterates over possible lengths of tandem repeats and checks how many characters align correctly at different positions in the string. It updates `max_length` when a longer tandem repeat is found.
- However, there are issues with the logic in `func_1` that make the program incorrect:
  1. The function `func_1` does not handle the replacement of question marks (`?`) with appropriate lowercase Latin letters to maximize the length of the tandem repeat.
  2. The logic in `func_1` focuses on counting matches rather than generating and checking all possible replacements of `?` with letters to achieve the maximum tandem repeat length.

Given these issues, the program does not correctly solve the problem as described.

Correctness: **False**
