Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Specifically, the function `func_1` is designed to find the maximum length of the longest tandem repeat substring. However, the logic within `func_1` is flawed. 

In the nested loop where `count` is updated, the following lines:
```python
if l > 0:
    count -= func_2(s[l - 1], s[l - 1 + d])
    count += func_2(s[l + d - 1], s[l + 2 * d - 1])
```
are intended to adjust the `count` variable to reflect changes in the substring being checked. However, these lines are not correctly implemented to handle the sliding window approach for finding tandem repeats. This leads to incorrect counting and, consequently, incorrect results for many test cases.

For example, consider the input `"zaabaabz"`. The expected output is `6`, but the program fails to achieve this because of the flawed logic in updating the `count` variable.

To correctly solve the problem, a more accurate approach would involve dynamically checking substrings and ensuring that each half matches perfectly, considering the replacement of question marks with appropriate lowercase letters.
