### Reasoning:

1. **Problem Understanding**:
   - The goal is to replace each question mark (`?`) in the input string with a lowercase Latin letter so that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is maximized.

2. **Function `func_2` Analysis**:
   - `func_2` checks if two characters (or a character and a question mark) match. This function is correct and works as intended based on the provided summary. It ensures that the comparison considers question marks as flexible placeholders.

3. **Function `func_1` Analysis**:
   - `func_1` iterates over possible tandem repeat lengths `d` and checks if the first half of the string matches the second half. It uses `func_2` to perform the matching.
   - The function does not directly handle replacing question marks; instead, it focuses on identifying existing tandem repeats in the string.

4. **Replacement of Question Marks**:
   - To maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat, we need to consider all possible replacements of question marks with lowercase Latin letters.
   - `func_1` alone does not account for this step. Instead, it identifies existing tandem repeats without altering the string.

5. **Missing Steps**:
   - The program needs to generate all possible replacements of question marks and then check the resulting string for the longest tandem repeat.
   - The current implementation does not handle this aspect of the problem, making the program incomplete.

### Conclusion:

The original assessment was accurate. The program does not correctly solve the problem because it fails to replace question marks with lowercase Latin letters to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. The `func_1` function only identifies existing tandem repeats but does not generate or check all possible replacements of question marks.

**Final: False**
