Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Specifically, the program does not perform the required task of replacing each question mark with a lowercase Latin letter to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Instead, the program attempts to find the longest tandem repeat substring without considering the question marks.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Problem Understanding**: The problem requires replacing each question mark with a lowercase Latin letter to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. However, the provided program does not perform this replacement.

2. **Function `func_1` Logic**: The logic inside `func_1` focuses on finding the longest tandem repeat substring in the current string `s` without considering any replacements. It calculates the maximum length of a tandem repeat by checking for equal halves of the string and adjusting counts as it iterates through the string. This approach does not account for replacing question marks with letters to potentially form longer tandem repeats.

3. **Function `func_2` Logic**: The function `func_2` checks if two characters are equal or if one of them is a question mark. While this is useful for determining if characters can form part of a tandem repeat, it is not used correctly in the context of solving the problem.

To meet the problem requirements, the program should:
- Replace each question mark with a lowercase Latin letter.
- Ensure that after replacements, the resulting string has the longest possible tandem repeat substring.
- Output the maximum length of such a tandem repeat substring for each test case.

In summary, the current implementation does not replace the question marks and thus cannot achieve the goal of maximizing the length of the longest tandem repeat substring. Therefore, the program is incorrect according to the problem description.
