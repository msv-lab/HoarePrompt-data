Reasoning:
- The problem requires replacing question marks in a string to maximize the length of the longest tandem repeat substring.
- The provided solution involves two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`.
- `func_2` checks if two characters are the same or if either is a question mark. This function is correctly designed to handle the comparison needed for forming tandem repeats.
- `func_1` calculates the maximum length of a tandem repeat by iterating over possible half-lengths `d` and counting matches using `func_2`. It updates `max_length` whenever it finds a valid tandem repeat.
- The main function reads input, calls `func_1`, and prints the result, which aligns with the problem requirements.

Given the detailed descriptions and the logic flow, the implementation seems to correctly solve the problem. It correctly identifies potential tandem repeats and maximizes their length by considering all question marks.

Correctness: **True**
