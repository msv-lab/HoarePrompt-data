Reasoning:

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - The task is to replace each question mark ('?') in a given string `s` with a lowercase Latin letter such that the length of the longest substring that is a tandem repeat is maximized.
   - A tandem repeat is defined as a string of even length where the first half is equal to the second half.
   - We need to check if the given implementation correctly solves the problem.

2. **Analyzing Function `func_2`:**
   - `func_2` checks if two characters `a` and `b` are the same or if either is a question mark.
   - This function is used to validate if the first half and second half of potential tandem repeats match when characters are replaced with question marks.

3. **Analyzing Function `func_1`:**
   - `func_1` aims to find the maximum length of a tandem repeat in the string `s`.
   - It iterates over possible lengths of the first half of a tandem repeat (`d`), checking if replacing '?' with appropriate characters can form a tandem repeat.
   - For each `d`, it counts how many characters need to be replaced to make the halves match.
   - It updates `max_length` if it finds a valid tandem repeat.

4. **Checking Correctness:**
   - The logic in `func_1` appears sound:
     - It correctly iterates over possible lengths of the first half of a tandem repeat.
     - It uses `func_2` to check for matching characters, including handling '?'.
     - It updates `max_length` only when it finds a valid tandem repeat.
   - The edge case handling (e.g., strings shorter than 2) is correctly accounted for, returning 0 immediately.
   - The function correctly considers all characters and their replacements, ensuring the longest possible tandem repeat is found.

Given the analysis, the program appears to be correctly implemented according to the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
