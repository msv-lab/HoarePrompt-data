The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are characters (lowercase Latin letters or '?'). It returns `True` if `a` is equal to `b`, or if `a` is a question mark ('?'), or if `b` is a question mark ('?'). This means that the function checks if `a` and `b` are the same character, or if either one of them is a question mark. If any of these conditions are met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function covers all edge cases where `a` and `b` can be any lowercase Latin letter or a question mark.
