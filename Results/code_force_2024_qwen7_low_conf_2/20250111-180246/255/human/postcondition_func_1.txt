The function `func_2` accepts a list `a` of non-negative integers and an integer `n`. It processes the list `a` to calculate a result list `ans` where each element `ans[i]` is determined based on several conditions involving indices and values within the list `a`. Specifically, `ans[i]` is calculated as `i + 1 - inx`, where `inx` is derived from two possible values: `inx2`, which is `last[i - 1]`, and `x`, which is `left[i] - a[i] - 1`. If `inx` is less than 0, it remains unchanged; otherwise, it takes the minimum value between `inx` and `inx2`. The function first initializes auxiliary lists `left` and `last` to keep track of cumulative sums and previous occurrences of elements in `a`, respectively. The function then iterates through the list `a` to populate the `ans` list according to the specified rules. The function handles edge cases such as repeated elements in `a` and ensures that the `ans` list is correctly populated for each index `i` in the range from 1 to `n-1`. If `a[i]` is less than `a[i - 1]`, `ans[i]` is set to 1, otherwise, the calculation for `ans[i]` follows the described logic.
