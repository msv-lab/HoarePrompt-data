The function processes a list of integers `a` for multiple test cases defined by `t`. It calculates an array `ans` where each element `ans[i]` represents the minimum distance to either a smaller element on the left or a larger element on the right for each element in the list `a`. If no such element exists, `ans[i]` is set to -1. The function first computes prefix sums and then iterates through the list twice to determine the minimum distances. After processing, it prints the resulting `ans` array. Potential edge cases include when the list `a` is empty or contains duplicate elements.
