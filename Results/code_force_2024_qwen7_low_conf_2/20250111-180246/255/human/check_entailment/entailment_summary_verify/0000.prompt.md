You are a program verifier. Your task is to evaluate the correctness of a Python program based on a given problem description, the program code, an initial assessment, and one or more function summaries of the code. A function summary describing a function's output states and return values.

Task:
1. Analyze the problem description, the program code, and the function summary(ies). Assume valid inputs.
2. Use the summary(ies) to systematically evaluate the programâ€™s behavior and reasoning. Use it (them) to validate or challenge the original assessment.
3. Decide whether to maintain or overturn the original assessment based on the evidence.

Reason about the code and explain if the  original assessment was accurate or inaccurate.
Then provide the final evaluation Final: **True** if the given program is correct  or Final: **False** if the given program is incorrect.



- Problem description: 
There are n slimes placed in a line. The slimes are numbered from 1 to n in
order from left to right. The size of the i -th slime is a_i .

Every second, the following happens: exactly one slime eats one of its
neighbors and increases its size by the eaten neighbor's size. A slime can eat
its neighbor only if it is strictly bigger than this neighbor. If there is no
slime which is strictly bigger than one of its neighbors, the process ends.

For example, suppose n = 5 , a = [2, 2, 3, 1, 4] . The process can go as
follows:

  * first, the 3 -rd slime eats the 2 -nd slime. The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 5 , the 2 -nd slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 1 -st slime (they are neighbors since the 2 -nd slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 7 , the 1 -st slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 5 -th slime eats the 4 -th slime. The size of the 5 -th slime becomes 5 , the 4 -th slime is eaten. 
  * then, the 3 -rd slime eats the 5 -th slime (they are neighbors since the 4 -th slime is already eaten). The size of the 3 -rd slime becomes 12 , the 5 -th slime is eaten. 

For each slime, calculate the minimum number of seconds it takes for this
slime to be eaten by another slime (among all possible ways the process can
go), or report that it is impossible.

Input

The first line contains a single integer t (1 \le t \le 10^4 ) â€” the number of
test cases.

The first line of each test case contains a single integer n (1 \le n \le 3
\cdot 10^5 ) â€” the number of slimes.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n (1 \le a_i \le 10^9
).

The sum of n over all test cases doesn't exceed 3 \cdot 10^5 .

Output

For each test case, print n integers. The i -th integer should be equal to the
minimum number of seconds it takes for the i -th slime to be eaten by another
slime or -1 if it is impossible.

    for i in range(n):
        curr = pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]
        ind1 = bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)
        ind = min(ind, ind1)
        if ind >= 0 and curr > 0:
            ans[i] = i - ind
        if i - 1 >= 0 and arr[i] != arr[i - 1]:
            if arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
                ans[i] = 1
                ind = i
    ind = n
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        curr = pref[i] + arr[i] + 1
        ind1 = bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)
        ind = max(ind, ind1)
        if ind < n and curr <= pref[-1]:
            ans[i] = min(ans[i], ind - i)
        if i + 1 < n and arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:
            if arr[i] < arr[i + 1]:
                ans[i] = 1
                ind = i
    for i in range(n):
        if ans[i] == 10 ** 9:
            ans[i] = -1
    print(*ans)



- Function Summary: 
The function processes a list of integers `a` for multiple test cases defined by `t`. It calculates an array `ans` where each element `ans[i]` represents the minimum distance to either a smaller element on the left or a larger element on the right for each element in the list `a`. If no such element exists, `ans[i]` is set to -1. The function first computes prefix sums and then iterates through the list twice to determine the minimum distances. After processing, it prints the resulting `ans` array. Potential edge cases include when the list `a` is empty or contains duplicate elements.

Beggining of Original Assessment: 
Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic for calculating the minimum number of seconds it takes for each slime to be eaten. Specifically, the program does not handle the case where a slime can potentially eat both its left and right neighbors in a single move, and it incorrectly calculates the indices and distances for such scenarios.

For example, consider the input:
```
4
2 2 3 1
```

The correct output should be:
```
1 1 1 1
```

However, the program will produce incorrect results because it does not account for the possibility of a slime eating both its neighbors in a single step. The program's logic for updating indices and calculating distances is flawed, leading to incorrect answers for certain configurations of slimes.
