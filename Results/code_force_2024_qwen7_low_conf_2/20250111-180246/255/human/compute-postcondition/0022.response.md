The code sets `ind` to the value of `i`. This means that the value of `ind` changes from its previous value (which was the minimum of its current value and `ind1`) to `i`. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 0 or less, `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`, `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`, `ind` is `i`, and the value of `ind` is greater than or equal to 0 and `curr` is greater than 0; `ans[i]` is 1 if the condition `ind >= 0 and curr > 0` is true, otherwise the variables `i`, `n`, `curr`, `ind1`, `ind`, and `ans[i]` remain unchanged; `i` is greater than or equal to 1 and `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i - 1]`; if the condition `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]` is true, then `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i - 1]`**.
