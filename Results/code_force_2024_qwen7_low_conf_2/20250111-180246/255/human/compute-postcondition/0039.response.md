The code snippet updates the value of `ans[i]` to `i - ind`. From the initial state, we know:

- `i` is 2
- `n` is greater than 1
- `curr` is `pref[2] - 2 * arr[2]`
- `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`
- `ind` is the minimum of its current value and `ind1`
- `ind` is greater than or equal to 0
- `curr` is greater than 0
- `ans[1]` is `1 - ind` if `ind >= 0` and `curr > 0`; otherwise, the variables `i`, `n`, `curr`, `ind1`, `ind`, and `ans[1]` remain unchanged, `ind` remains the same, and `ind1` is updated.

Since `i` is 2, the code snippet will update `ans[2]` to `2 - ind`.

Therefore, the updated value of `ans[2]` is `2 - ind`.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is `pref[2] - 2 * arr[2]`, `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`, `ind` is the minimum of its current value and `ind1`, `ind` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is greater than 0, `ans[1]` is `1 - ind` if `ind >= 0` and `curr > 0`; otherwise, the variables `i`, `n`, `curr`, `ind1`, and `ind` remain unchanged, and `ans[2]` is `2 - ind`.**
