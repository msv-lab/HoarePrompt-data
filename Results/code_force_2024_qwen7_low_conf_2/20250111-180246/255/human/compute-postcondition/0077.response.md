The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` to `ind`. The value of `i` remains unchanged from its previous state, which is `i - 2`. All other variables retain their previous values.

Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, `ans[i]` is `1`, `ind` is `i`**
