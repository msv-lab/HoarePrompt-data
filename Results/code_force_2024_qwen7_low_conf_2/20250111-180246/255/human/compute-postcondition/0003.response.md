According to the given for loop:
```python
for i in range(1, n):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

To determine the necessary states before the loop starts, we need to consider what conditions must be true for the loop to execute correctly.

1. The variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `n-1`. This means `i` should be in the range [1, n-1] during each iteration of the loop.
2. For the loop to start executing, `i` must be at least 1. Since the loop starts with `i = 1`, `i` must be 1 initially.

Given these considerations, we need to ensure:
- `i` is set to 1.
- `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`.

The initial state of other variables (`t`, `arr`, `a`, `pref`) does not directly affect the loop's execution condition but may be important for the loop body. However, since the problem specifically asks for adjustments to allow the loop to execute, we focus on `i` and `n`.

State: **`i` is 1, `n` must be greater than 1**
