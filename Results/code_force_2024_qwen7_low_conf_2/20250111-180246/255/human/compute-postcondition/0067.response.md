The code sets `ind` to the value of `i`. This does not change the values of the other variables, but it updates `ind` to be `i`.

Output State: **`i` is `i - 1`; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ans[i-1]` is updated based on the conditions involving `ind` and `curr`; `ind1` is set to `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`; `ind` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ind` is `i`.**
