Output State: **`i` is `n-1`; `n` must be greater than 1; `pref[0]` is unchanged; for all `j` in the range `[1, n-1]`, `pref[j]` is `(j+1) * pref[0]`**

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over the range `1` to `n-1`. For each iteration, `i` is incremented, and `pref[i]` is updated by adding `pref[i-1]` to it.
   
2. **Initial Values and Invariants:**
   - Initially, `pref[0]` is the sum of the first element of `arr`, so `pref[0]` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
   - The loop updates `pref[i]` by accumulating the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`.

3. **Observations from the First Few Iterations:**
   - After the first iteration (`i=1`), `pref[1]` becomes `pref[0]`.
   - After the second iteration (`i=2`), `pref[2]` becomes `2 * pref[0]`.
   - After the third iteration (`i=3`), `pref[3]` becomes `4 * pref[0]`.

4. **General Pattern:**
   - Each time the loop runs, `pref[i]` is updated to the cumulative sum up to that index.
   - By the end of the loop, `pref[i]` for each `i` from `1` to `n-1` will be the cumulative sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`, which is `(i+1) * pref[0]`.

5. **Final State:**
   - The loop runs until `i` reaches `n-1`, meaning it will execute `n-1` times.
   - Therefore, the final state will have `i` as `n-1`.
   - All `pref[i]` for `i` from `0` to `n-1` will hold the cumulative sums as described by the pattern observed.

Thus, after the loop completes all its iterations, the values of the variables will be as stated above.
