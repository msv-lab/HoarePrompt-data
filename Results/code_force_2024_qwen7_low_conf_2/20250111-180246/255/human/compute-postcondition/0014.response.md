`ind1` is assigned the value of the leftmost insertion point in the list `pref` where the value `curr` can be inserted without violating the sorted order of `pref`. The value of `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`, where `i` is 0 or less and `n` is greater than 1. However, since the actual values of `pref` and `arr` are not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `ind1`. But we know that `ind1` is the index after which `curr` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is 0 or less, `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`, `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`.

Output State: **`i` is 0 or less, `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`, `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`.**
