`pref[i]` is updated by adding `pref[i - 1]` to it. Given that `i` is 2, `pref[i]` which is `pref[2]` is updated by adding `pref[1]` to it. Since `pref[1]` is equal to `pref[0]`, `pref[2]` is now `pref[0] + pref[0]`. The other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `pref[0]` is unchanged, `pref[1]` is `pref[0]`, `pref[2]` is `2 * pref[0]`**
