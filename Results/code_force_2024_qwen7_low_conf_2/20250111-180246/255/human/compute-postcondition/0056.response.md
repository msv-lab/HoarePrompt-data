The code sets `ans[i]` to 1, regardless of the previous value of `ans[i]`. Since `i` decreases from \( n-1 \) to 0, `i` is still in this range after executing the code. The other variables (`curr`, `ind1`, `ind`, `arr[i]`, and `arr[i+1]`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`i` decreases from \( n-1 \) to 0; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ans[i]` is 1; the current value of `i` is less than \( n-1 \); `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`; `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`**
