Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, for each `i` from `n-1` to 0, `ans[i]` is the minimum of its current value and `ind - i` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, if `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]` for any `i`, `ans[i]` is set to 1 and `ind` is set to `i`. The current value of `ans[i]` is `10 ** 9`.**
