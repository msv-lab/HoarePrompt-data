To determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's break down the given information and analyze the loop.

### Given Information:
- **State at the end of the previous iteration:**
  - `i` is 0
  - `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`
  - `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`
  - `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`
  - For each `i` from `n-1` to 0, `ans[i]` is `-1` if the original value was `10` and `10` otherwise. If `ans[i] == 10`, then `ind` is updated as described above.

### Loop Analysis:
The loop iterates over `i` from `n-1` to `0`. At the start of the current iteration, `i` is 0.

### State Adjustment:
1. **`i`**: Since the loop is iterating from `n-1` to `0`, the next value of `i` would be `i - 1`. If `i` was 0, the next value of `i` would be `-1`.

2. **`curr`**: The value of `curr` is defined based on `pref` and `arr`. It does not change within the loop unless specified. Therefore, it remains `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`.

3. **`ind1`**: The value of `ind1` is determined by finding the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`. This value does not change within the loop unless the array `pref` changes. Therefore, `ind1` remains the same.

4. **`ind`**: The value of `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`. If the original value of `ind` was `10` and `ans[i]` is not `-1`, then `ind` remains unchanged. If `ans[i] == 10`, then `ind` is updated to the value of `ind1`.

5. **`ans[i]`**: The value of `ans[i]` is initially set based on the condition. If `ans[i]` is `10`, then `ind` is updated. If `ans[i]` is `-1`, then `ind` remains unchanged.

Since the loop is about to start a new iteration (with `i = -1`), we need to consider how the states might be adjusted.

### Adjusted States:
- `i` becomes `-1`.
- `curr` remains `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`.
- `ind1` remains the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`.
- `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`.

### Final State:
- `i` is `-1`.
- `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`.
- `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`.
- `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: `i` is -1, `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`**.
