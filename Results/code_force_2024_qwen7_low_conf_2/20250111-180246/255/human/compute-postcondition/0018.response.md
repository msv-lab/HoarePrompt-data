Postcondition: ***`i` is 0 or less, `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`, `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`, `ind` is the minimum of its current value and `ind1`, and the value of `ind` is greater than or equal to 0 and `curr` is greater than 0; `ans[i]` is `i - ind` if the condition `ind >= 0 and curr > 0` is true, otherwise the variables `i`, `n`, `curr`, `ind1`, `ind`, and `ans[i]` remain unchanged.***
