Postcondition: ***`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is `pref[1] - 2 * arr[1]`, `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`, `ind` is the minimum of its current value and `ind1`, `ind` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is greater than 0, `ans[1]` is `1 - ind` if `ind >= 0` and `curr > 0`; otherwise, the variables `i`, `n`, `curr`, `ind1`, `ind`, and `ans[1]` remain unchanged, `ind` remains the same. If `arr[i] < arr[i - 1]`, then `i` remains 1, `n` remains greater than 1, `curr` remains `pref[1] - 2 * arr[1]`, `ind1` remains the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`, `ind` is set to 1, `ind` remains greater than or equal to 0, `curr` remains greater than 0, `ans[1]` is set to 1.***
