Let's break down the problem step-by-step to determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute.

### Initial States:
- `i` is \( n-1 \)
- `n` is greater than 1
- `curr` is \( pref[i] - 2 * arr[i] \)
- `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`
- `ind` is \( n \)
- `ind` is greater than or equal to 0
- `curr` is greater than 0
- `ans[i]` is \( i - ind \) if the condition `ind >= 0` and `curr > 0` is true, otherwise `ans[i]` remains \( 10 \)
- If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, then `ans[i]` is 1.

### Loop Conditions:
The loop iterates over the range from `n-1` to `-1` (inclusive) with a step of `-1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values:**
   - `i` is initially set to \( n-1 \).
   - `n` is confirmed to be greater than 1.
   - `curr` is calculated as \( pref[i] - 2 * arr[i] \).
   - `ind1` is determined as the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`.
   - `ind` is initialized to \( n \).
   - `ind` is checked to be greater than or equal to 0.
   - `curr` is checked to be greater than 0.
   - `ans[i]` is set based on the conditions involving `ind` and `curr`.
   - The value of `arr[i]` is compared to `arr[i-1]` to determine the value of `ans[i]`.

2. **Loop Execution:**
   - For each iteration, `i` decreases by 1 until it reaches -1.
   - In each iteration, `curr` is recalculated as \( pref[i] - 2 * arr[i] \).
   - `ind1` is recalculated as the leftmost insertion point of the new `curr` in the sorted list `pref`.
   - `ind` remains \( n \) but should be checked against 0 in subsequent iterations.
   - `curr` is still required to be greater than 0.
   - `ans[i]` is updated based on the conditions.

### Adjusted States for Loop Execution:
To ensure the loop executes correctly, we need to ensure that:
- `i` starts from \( n-1 \) and decreases to 0 (or -1).
- `n` remains greater than 1 throughout the loop.
- `curr` is recalculated in each iteration and must be greater than 0.
- `ind1` is recalculated and should be valid (i.e., within the bounds of the list).
- `ind` should be checked to ensure it remains valid (greater than or equal to 0).
- `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]` should be compared correctly to update `ans[i]`.

### Final State Adjustment:
Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` starts from \( n-1 \) and decreases to 0.
- `n` remains greater than 1.
- `curr` is recalculated and must be greater than 0.
- `ind1` is recalculated and must be a valid index.
- `ind` should remain greater than or equal to 0.
- `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]` comparison should be valid for updating `ans[i]`.

### Final Answer:
State: **`i` starts from \( n-1 \) and decreases to 0, `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is recalculated and must be greater than 0, `ind1` is recalculated and must be a valid index, `ind` remains greater than or equal to 0, `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]` comparison should be valid for updating `ans[i]`**
