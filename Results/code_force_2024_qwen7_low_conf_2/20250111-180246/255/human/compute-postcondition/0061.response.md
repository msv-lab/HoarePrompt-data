The code updates the value of `curr` to `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`. Given the initial state:
- `i` is \( i - 1 \)
- `curr` is `pref[i-1] + arr[i-1] + 1`
- `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`
- `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`
- `ans[i-1]` is updated based on the conditions involving `ind` and `curr`

After executing the line `curr = pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, the value of `curr` changes to `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `i` is still \( i - 1 \)
- `ind1` remains the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr` (which is now `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`)
- `ind` remains the maximum of its original value and `ind1`
- `ans[i-1]` is updated based on the conditions involving `ind` and the new value of `curr`

Output State: **`i` is \( i - 1 \); `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ans[i-1]` is updated based on the conditions involving `ind` and `curr`**
