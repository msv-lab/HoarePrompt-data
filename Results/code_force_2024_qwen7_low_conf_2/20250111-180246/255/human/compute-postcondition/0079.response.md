Postcondition: ***`i` is `i - 2`, `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, `ans[i]` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and `ind - i`. If `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, then `ans[i]` is set to this new value. If the condition `ind < n and curr <= pref[-1]` is not met, `ans[i]` remains unchanged. Additionally, if `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`, `ans[i]` is set to `1` and `ind` is set to `i`.***
