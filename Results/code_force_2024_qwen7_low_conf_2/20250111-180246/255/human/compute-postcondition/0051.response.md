Postcondition: **`i` decreases from \( n-1 \) to 0; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; the current value of `ind` is less than `n` and `curr` is less than or equal to `pref[-1]`**
