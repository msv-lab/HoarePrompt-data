Functionality: **The function processes a list of integers `a` for multiple test cases defined by `t`. It calculates an array `ans` where each element `ans[i]` represents the minimum distance to either a smaller element on the left or a larger element on the right for each element in the list `a`. If no such element exists, `ans[i]` is set to -1. The function first computes prefix sums and then iterates through the list twice to determine the minimum distances. After processing, it prints the resulting `ans` array. Potential edge cases include when the list `a` is empty or contains duplicate elements.**

**Specifically, the function performs the following actions:**
1. Reads the number of test cases `t` and the list `a` for each test case.
2. Computes the prefix sums of the list `a` and stores them in the array `pref`.
3. Iterates through the list to calculate the minimum distance to a smaller element on the left and updates the `ans` array accordingly.
4. Reverses the iteration direction to calculate the minimum distance to a larger element on the right and updates the `ans` array again.
5. Sets any remaining unmodified values in `ans` to -1.
6. Prints the final `ans` array.
