The given code prints the contents of the list `ans`. However, the code snippet does not modify any of the variables or lists mentioned in the initial state. It only prints the list `ans` without performing any operations on it. Therefore, the values of `i`, `curr`, `ind1`, `ind`, and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is -1, `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, for each `i` from `n-1` to 0, `ans[i]` is -1 if the original value was 10, print(*ans)**
