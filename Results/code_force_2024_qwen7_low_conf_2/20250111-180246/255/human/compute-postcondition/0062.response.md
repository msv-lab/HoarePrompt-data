The code snippet updates `ind1` to be the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`. The previous value of `ind1` was the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, but now it is explicitly set using `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`. The states of the other variables (`i`, `curr`, `ind`, `ans[i-1]`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is \( i - 1 \); `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ans[i-1]` is updated based on the conditions involving `ind` and `curr`; `ind1` is set to `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`**
