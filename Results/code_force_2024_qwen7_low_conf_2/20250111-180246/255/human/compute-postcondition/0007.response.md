According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` must be greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, making it 3. Additionally, `n` must still be greater than 1.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial State**: `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `pref[0]` is unchanged, `pref[1]` is `pref[0]`, `pref[2]` is `2 * pref[0]`.
2. **Increment `i`**: The loop will increment `i` by 1, so `i` becomes 3.
3. **Condition for Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute again, `n` must still be greater than 1.

Thus, the new state at the start of the next iteration should reflect these changes.

State: **`i` is 3, `n` must be greater than 1, `pref[0]` is unchanged, `pref[1]` is `pref[0]`, `pref[2]` is `2 * pref[0]`**
