The code snippet `ans[i] = 1` sets the value of `ans[i]` to 1. Given that `i` is 2 from the initial state, `ans[2]` is now set to 1. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is `pref[2] - 2 * arr[2]`, `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`, `ind` is the minimum of its current value and `ind1`, `ind` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is greater than 0, `ans[1]` is `1 - ind` if `ind >= 0` and `curr > 0`; otherwise, `i`, `n`, `curr`, `ind1`, and `ind` remain unchanged, and `ans[2]` is 1.**
