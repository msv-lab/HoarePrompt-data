The code updates the value of `ans[i]` to the minimum of its current value and `ind - i`. Here are the steps:

1. The initial state is given as follows:
   - `i` decreases from \( n-1 \) to 0.
   - `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`.
   - `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`.
   - `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`.
   - The current value of `ind` is less than `n`.
   - `curr` is less than or equal to `pref[-1]`.

2. The code snippet updates `ans[i]`:
   - `ans[i] = min(ans[i], ind - i)`.

This means `ans[i]` will take the minimum value between its current value and `ind - i`.

Since the exact values of `ans[i]` and `ind` are not provided, we express the updated value of `ans[i]` in terms of the minimum of these two values.

Output State: **`i` decreases from \( n-1 \) to 0; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; the current value of `ind` is less than `n` and `curr` is less than or equal to `pref[-1]`; `ans[i]` is updated to `min(ans[i], ind - i)`**.
