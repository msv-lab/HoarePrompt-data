The code snippet sets `ans[i]` to `-1` for the current value of `i`. Given the precondition, the value of `ans[i]` is currently `10`. After executing `ans[i] = -1`, the value of `ans[i]` will be `-1`. 

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`i` is 0, `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, for each `i` from `n-1` to 0, `ans[i]` is `-1` if the original value was `10` and `10` otherwise, if `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]` for any `i`, `ans[i]` is set to `1` and `ind` is set to `i`.**
