The code initializes a list `ans` with `n` elements, where each element is set to `10 ** 9`. This operation does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `pref`, or `ind`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, except for the new list `ans`.

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `pref[0]` is unchanged, for all `j` in the range `[1, n-1]`, `pref[j]` is `(j+1) * pref[0]`, `ind` is `-1`, `ans` is a list of `n` elements where each element is `10 ** 9`**
