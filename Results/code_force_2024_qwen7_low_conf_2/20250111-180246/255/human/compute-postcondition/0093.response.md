The function `func_1` accepts no explicit parameters in its definition. However, based on the constraints and relationships provided, it seems the function should accept at least two parameters: `t` and `a`. Here, `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\), and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\). Additionally, the sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed \(3 \cdot 10^5\).

Given the outputs described, it appears the function processes each test case defined by `t` and returns some kind of result based on the list `a`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `t` (an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\)) and `a` (a list of integers such that \(1 \leq n \leq 3 \cdot 10^5\) and \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\)), and returns a result based on processing the list `a` for each test case defined by `t`.**
