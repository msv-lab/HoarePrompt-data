Postcondition: ***`i` is `i - 1`; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ans[i-1]` is updated based on the conditions involving `ind` and `curr`; `ind1` is set to `bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`; `ind` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; if `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`, then `ind` is `i`. Otherwise, the conditions remain as updated within the if block. Additionally, if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, `ans[i]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - i`. Otherwise, the conditions remain as updated within the if block.***
