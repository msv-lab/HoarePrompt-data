Let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `i` is 1
   - `n` must be greater than 1
   - `pref[1]` is equal to `pref[0]`

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(1, n):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Condition Analysis:**
   - The loop starts with `i = 1` and increments `i` by 1 in each iteration.
   - The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`.

4. **Current Values and Conditions:**
   - Since `i` is currently 1 and the loop runs from 1 to `n-1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
   - For the loop to continue, `i < n` must still hold true.
   - Given that `n` must be greater than 1 and `i` was 1, `n` must still be greater than 1.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - `i` will be incremented from 1 to 2.
   - `n` must remain greater than 1 for the loop to continue.

6. **Final State:**
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `n` must still be greater than 1.
   - `pref[1]` remains unchanged as no information suggests it changes within the loop body.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

**State: **`i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 1, `pref[1]` is `pref[0]***
