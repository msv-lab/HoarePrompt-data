Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `i` is -1 (indicating the previous iteration was the first one).
   - `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`.
   - `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`.
   - `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`.
   - `ans[i]` is -1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Current Iteration:**
   - Since `i` was -1, the next iteration will set `i` to 0.
   - We need to determine the new values for `curr`, `ind1`, `ind`, and `ans[i]` based on the loop starting at `i = 0`.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be 0.
   - `curr` will be recalculated as `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`.
   - `ind1` will be the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`.
   - `ind` will be the maximum of its original value and `ind1`.
   - `ans[i]` will be updated to some value based on the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we only know it will be assigned a value.

Given these considerations, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` should be 0.
- `curr` should be recalculated as `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`.
- `ind1` will be determined by finding the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`.
- `ind` will be the maximum of its original value and `ind1`.
- `ans[i]` will be assigned some value, but we don't know what specific value without the loop body.

State: **`i` is 0, `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, `ans[i]` is some value**
