Postcondition: **`i` is -1, `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, `ans[i]` is -1**.

This postcondition summarizes the state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering the condition `ans[i] == 10 ** 9` and its respective impacts.
