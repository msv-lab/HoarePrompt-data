`pref[i]` is updated to be the value of `pref[i]` plus `pref[i - 1]`. Given the initial state where `i` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, the value of `i - 1` is 0. Therefore, `pref[i]` becomes `pref[1]` which is now equal to `pref[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`i` is 1; `n` must be greater than 1; `pref[1]` is `pref[0]`**
