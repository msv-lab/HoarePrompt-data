`ans[i]` is assigned the value `1`. Since `i` is 1, `ans[1]` is set to `1`. All other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the updated value of `ans[1]` is `1`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is `pref[1] - 2 * arr[1]`, `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`, `ind` is the minimum of its current value and `ind1`, `ind` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is greater than 0, `ans[1]` is `1`**, and **`ind` remains the same.**
