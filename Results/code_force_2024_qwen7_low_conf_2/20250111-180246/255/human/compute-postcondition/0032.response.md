The code `ind = i` assigns the value of `i` (which is 1) to the variable `ind`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is `pref[1] - 2 * arr[1]`, `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`, `ind` is 1, `ind` is greater than or equal to 0, `curr` is greater than 0, `ans[1]` is `1`**
