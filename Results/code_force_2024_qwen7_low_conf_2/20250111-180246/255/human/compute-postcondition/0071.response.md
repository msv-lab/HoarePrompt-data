The code updates the value of `curr` using the formula `curr = pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`. The other variables (`i`, `ind1`, `ind`, and `ans`) are not directly affected by this line of code. Let's break down the changes:

1. `curr` is updated to `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`.
2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is `i - 2`, `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, if `i + 1 < n` and `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]`, then:
- If `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`, `ind` is `i`.
- If `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, `ans[i - 1]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - (i - 1)`; `curr` is now `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`.

However, since the conditions for updating `ind` and `ans` are not directly impacted by the line `curr = pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, we only update `curr` here.

Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, if `i + 1 < n` and `arr[i] != arr[i + 1]`, then: If `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`, `ind` is `i`. If `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, `ans[i - 1]` is updated to be the minimum between its current value and `ind - (i - 1)`**.
