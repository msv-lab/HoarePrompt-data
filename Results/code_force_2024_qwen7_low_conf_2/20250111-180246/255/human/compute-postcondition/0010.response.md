The variable `ind` is assigned the value `-1`. This assignment does not affect the values of `i`, `n`, `pref[0]`, or the values of `pref[j]` for any `j` in the range `[1, n-1]`. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`i` is `n-1`, `n` must be greater than 1, `pref[0]` is unchanged, for all `j` in the range `[1, n-1]`, `pref[j]` is `(j+1) * pref[0]`, `ind` is `-1`**
