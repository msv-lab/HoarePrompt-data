The code `ind = i` assigns the current value of `i` to the variable `ind`. The value of `i` is specified as being less than \( n-1 \), and none of the other variables are affected by this assignment.

Therefore, the updated state is:
- `i` is still less than \( n-1 \)
- `curr` remains `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`
- `ind1` remains the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`
- `ind` is now equal to `i` (previously it was the maximum of its original value and `ind1`)
- `ans[i]` is still 1
- `arr[i]` is still not equal to `arr[i + 1]`
- `arr[i]` is still less than `arr[i + 1]`

Output State: **`i` is less than \( n-1 \); `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`; `ind` is `i`; `ans[i]` is 1; `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`; `arr[i]` is less than `arr[i + 1]`**
