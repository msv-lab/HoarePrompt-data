`ans[i]` is assigned the value `-1`. This changes the value of `ans[i]` from its original unspecified value to `-1`. The values of the other variables (`i`, `curr`, `ind1`, `ind`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`i` is 0, `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, `ans[i]` is -1**
