Postcondition: ***`i` decreases from \( n-1 \) to 0; `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`; `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`; `ans[i]` is updated to `min(ans[i], ind - i)` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`. If `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`, then `ind` is `i` and `ans[i]` is 1. Otherwise, `ans[i]` retains its original value and the current value of `i` is less than \( n-1 \); `arr[i]` is not equal to `arr[i + 1]`.***
