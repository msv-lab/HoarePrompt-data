To determine the final state of the variables after the loop has executed, we need to analyze the effect of the loop on each variable step-by-step and consider the conditions under which the loop continues to execute.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial Values and Loop Execution Conditions:**
   - Initial value: \(i = n-1\).
   - Loop runs as long as \(i \geq 0\).
   - At each iteration, \(i\) decreases by 1.
   - The loop updates `curr`, `ind1`, and `ind`.
   - The value of `ans[i]` is updated based on certain conditions involving `ind` and `curr`.

2. **Key Variables and Their Updates:**
   - `curr = pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`
   - `ind1 = bisect.bisect_left(pref, curr)`
   - `ind = max(ind, ind1)`
   - `ans[i] = min(ans[i], ind - i)` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`
   - `if i + 1 < n and arr[i] != arr[i + 1]:`
     - If `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]`, then `ind = i` and `ans[i] = 1`.

3. **Final Values After All Iterations:**
   - Since the loop decrements `i` from \(n-1\) to 0, it will execute \(n\) times.
   - For each \(i\), the loop updates `curr`, `ind1`, and `ind`.
   - The value of `ans[i]` is determined based on the conditions described above.

4. **Final Values of Variables:**
   - After the loop completes, `i` will be \(-1\).
   - `curr` will be the last value computed, which is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`.
   - `ind1` will be the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`.
   - `ind` will be the maximum of the original `ind` and `ind1`.
   - `ans[i]` for each `i` from \(n-1\) to 0 will be updated based on the conditions involving `ind` and `curr`.

### Final Output State:

**Output State:**
- `i` is \(-1\).
- `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`.
- `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`.
- `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`.
- For each `i` from \(n-1\) to 0, `ans[i]` is the minimum of its current value and `ind - i` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`.
- If `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]` for any `i`, `ans[i]` is set to 1 and `ind` is set to `i`.

Thus, the final output state is:
Output State: **`i` is \(-1\), `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, and for each `i` from \(n-1\) to 0, `ans[i]` is the minimum of its current value and `ind - i` if `ind < n` and `curr <= pref[-1]`, and if `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]` for any `i`, `ans[i]` is set to 1 and `ind` is set to `i`.**
