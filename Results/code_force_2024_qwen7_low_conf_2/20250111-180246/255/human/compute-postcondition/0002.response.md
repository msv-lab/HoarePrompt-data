The code creates a new list `pref` that contains the first `i+1` elements of `arr` for each index `i` in the range from 0 to `n-1`. Specifically, `pref[i]` will be equal to the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`.

The initial state includes:
- `t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4,
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5,
- `arr` is a list of integers (converted from input),
- `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

After executing the code:
- `arr` remains unchanged,
- `a` remains unchanged,
- `pref` is a new list where `pref[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers, `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9, `pref` is a list of `n` integers where `pref[i]` is the sum of the first `i+1` elements of `arr`.**
