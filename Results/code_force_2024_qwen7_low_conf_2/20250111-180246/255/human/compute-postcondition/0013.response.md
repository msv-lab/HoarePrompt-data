The code snippet `curr = pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]` calculates a new value for `curr` using the values of `pref[i]` and `arr[i]`. However, the initial values of `pref` and `arr` are not specified in the initial state. Therefore, we can only state that `curr` is calculated based on these two arrays.

- `i` must be decremented to 0 or less, so `i` is now 0 or less.
- `n` must be greater than 1, so `n` remains greater than 1.

The calculation of `curr` does not affect the conditions or values of `i` and `n`, but it updates `curr` based on the given formula.

Output State: **`i` is 0 or less, `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is `pref[i] - 2 * arr[i]`**
