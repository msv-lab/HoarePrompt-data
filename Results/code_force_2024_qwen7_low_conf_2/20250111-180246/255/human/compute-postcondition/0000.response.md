`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `t` remains unchanged, and the list `a` is not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, and `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. The sum of all `n` across all test cases does not exceed 3 ⋅ 10^5.**
