Postcondition: **`i` is 0, `curr` is `pref[0] + arr[0] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, for each `i` from `n-1` to 0, `ans[i]` is `-1` if the original value was `10` and `10` otherwise. If `ans[i] == 10 ** 9`, `ans[i]` is set to `-1` and `ind` remains unchanged. If `arr[i] < arr[i + 1]` for any `i`, `ans[i]` is set to `1` and `ind` is set to `i`.**
