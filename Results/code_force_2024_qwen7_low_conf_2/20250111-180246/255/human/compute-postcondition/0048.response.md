The code snippet updates the variable `curr` by assigning it the value of `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`. This means that the current value of `curr` is updated to this new value, while other variables remain unchanged.

Given the initial state:
- `i` starts from \( n-1 \) and decreases to 0.
- `n` is greater than 1.
- `curr` is recalculated and must be greater than 0.
- `ind1` is recalculated and must be a valid index.
- `ind` remains greater than or equal to 0.
- `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]` comparison should be valid for updating `ans[i]`.

After executing the line `curr = pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, the only change is in the value of `curr`.

Output State: **`i` starts from \( n-1 \) and decreases to 0; `n` is greater than 1; `curr` is updated to `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`; `ind1` is recalculated and must be a valid index; `ind` remains greater than or equal to 0; `arr[i]` and `arr[i-1]` comparison should be valid for updating `ans[i]`.**
