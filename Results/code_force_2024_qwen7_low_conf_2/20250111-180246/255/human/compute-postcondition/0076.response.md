`ans[i]` is assigned the value `1`. This overrides the previously defined update logic for `ans[i]` based on the conditions involving `ind` and `curr`. All other variables remain unchanged according to the initial state.

Output State: **`i` is `i - 2`, `curr` is `pref[i] + arr[i] + 1`, `ind1` is the smallest index in `pref` such that `pref[ind1] >= curr`, `ind` is the maximum of its original value and `ind1`, `ans[i]` is `1`.**
