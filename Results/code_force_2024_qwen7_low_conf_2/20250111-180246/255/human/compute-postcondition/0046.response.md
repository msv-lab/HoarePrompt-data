The code sets `ind` to `n`. This directly assigns the value `n` to the variable `ind`, without affecting the values of the other variables. Therefore, the only change is the value of `ind`.

Output State: **`i` is \( n-1 \), `n` is greater than 1, `curr` is \( pref[i] - 2 * arr[i] \), `ind1` is the leftmost insertion point of `curr` in the sorted list `pref`, `ind` is \( n \), `ind` is greater than or equal to 0 and `curr` is greater than 0, `ans[i]` is \( i - ind \) if the condition `ind >= 0` and `curr > 0` is true, otherwise `ans[i]` remains \( 10 \); if `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, then `ans[i]` is 1.**
