The code `arr = list(map(int, input().split()))` takes a line of space-separated integers as input and converts each integer into a list. The initial state values of `t` and `n` are not directly used in this operation, but they define the context of the problem. The `a` list remains unchanged, and the input will be split and converted into a new list `arr`.

After executing the code, the input is expected to be a series of space-separated integers. These integers will be converted to a list and stored in `arr`. The values of `t` and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3 ⋅ 10^5, `arr` is a list of integers (converted from input), `a` is a list of `n` integers such that 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.**
