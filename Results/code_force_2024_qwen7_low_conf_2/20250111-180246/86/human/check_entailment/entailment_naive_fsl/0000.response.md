Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the program does not account for the fact that you can choose additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles formed. The logic in the program seems to focus on counting gaps between the chosen vertices and splitting them evenly, but it does not consider all possible ways to form triangles by strategically choosing additional vertices.

For instance, consider the following case:

Input:
```
4 3 1
1 3 4
```

The program should aim to form as many triangles as possible by considering whether adding one additional vertex can help form more triangles. However, the current implementation may not explore all possibilities and could miss the optimal solution.

A correct approach would involve dynamically exploring different ways to place the additional vertices to maximize the number of triangles, which is not handled in the current implementation.
