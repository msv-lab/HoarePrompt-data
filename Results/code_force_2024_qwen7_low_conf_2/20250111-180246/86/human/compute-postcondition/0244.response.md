Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Initial States at the End of Previous Iteration:**
   - `x` is greater than 0.
   - `next_elem` is either `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, or `a[i + 1]` otherwise.
   - `gap` is updated to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.
   - `odd` contains `[gap]` if `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd.
   - `even` contains the value of `gap` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, otherwise `even` remains unchanged.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(x):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis of Loop Execution:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`.
   - After each iteration, `i` increases by 1.
   - The loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `x`.

4. **Determine the Next State:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is equal to `x - 1`.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`.

5. **Adjusting the States:**
   - Since `i` was `x - 1` and needs to be less than `x` for the loop to execute again, `i` should now be `x`.
   - All other states (`x`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, and `even`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the loop condition.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`x` is greater than 0; `next_elem` is either `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, or `a[i + 1]` otherwise; `gap` is updated to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; `odd` contains `[gap]` if `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd; `even` contains the value of `gap` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, otherwise `even` remains unchanged; `i` is `x`**
