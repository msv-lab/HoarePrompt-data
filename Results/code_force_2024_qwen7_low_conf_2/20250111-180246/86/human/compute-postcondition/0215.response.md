The code updates the value of `t1` to \((a[i] + 1) \% n\). The initial value of `t1` was \((a[i+1] + 1) \% n\), and now it is updated to \((a[i] + 1) \% n\). The value of `t2` remains \((a[i+1] + 2) \% n\) because it was not affected by this line of code. The value of `ans` remains unchanged unless the new condition (new `t1` not in `st` and new `t2` in `st`) is met, but since no such condition check is performed here, `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`t1` is \((a[i] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[i+1] + 2) \% n\), `ans` remains unchanged unless the new condition (new `t1` not in `st` and new `t2` in `st`) is met.**
