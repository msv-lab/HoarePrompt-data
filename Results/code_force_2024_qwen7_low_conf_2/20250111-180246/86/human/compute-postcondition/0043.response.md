Postcondition: **`odd` contains `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise it retains its previous state. `even` contains `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even, otherwise it retains its previous state. `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`; `gap` is `a[0] + n - a[i] - 1` if `i` equals `x - 1` and `a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1` otherwise.**
