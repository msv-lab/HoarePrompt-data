`ans` is incremented by `2 * y`. Since `y` is an integer less than `gap // 2`, the value of `2 * y` is an even number less than `gap`. The state of `y` remains unchanged, and the precondition that `y` is an integer less than `gap // 2` is still valid.

Output State: **`y` is an integer less than `gap // 2`; `ans` is `ans` plus `2 * y`**
