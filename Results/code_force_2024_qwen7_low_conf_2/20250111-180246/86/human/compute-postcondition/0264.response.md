The code `y = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. The value of `y` was previously given by the expression `0 - (last_gap + 2)/2`, and now it is directly set to 0. The value of `ans` remains unchanged from its previous state, which was `ans - (last_gap + 2)`.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is `ans - (last_gap + 2)`**
