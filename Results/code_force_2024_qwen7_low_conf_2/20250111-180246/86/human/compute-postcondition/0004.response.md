The code snippet `a = [(num - 1) for num in a]` iterates through each element in the list `a` and subtracts 1 from each element, then assigns the new list back to `a`. This means each element in the list `a` is decreased by 1. 

Given the initial state where `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are replaced by the values read from input and stored in the list `a`, after executing the code, each of these values (now stored in `a`) will be reduced by 1. 

Output State: **`a` is [value-1 for value in [t, n, x, y]]**
