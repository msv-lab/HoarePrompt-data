Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from input, `x` is `x + 1`, `y` is `y_initial - gap // 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one pair of elements with an odd gap greater than 1, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the sum of all gaps in `odd` plus the current value of `gap` plus `gap` plus `2 * (y_initial - gap // 2)`, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is a list containing one less element than before, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement if `y < gap // 2`.***
