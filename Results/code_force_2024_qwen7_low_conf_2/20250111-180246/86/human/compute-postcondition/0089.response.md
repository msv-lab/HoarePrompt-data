Postcondition: ***`y` is 0 minus `next_gap // 2`, `ans` is the sum of all `gap` values encountered in the loop (including `next_gap`) plus `next_gap` minus `next_gap`. If `y < gap // 2`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `odd` is the original list of all values of `gap` such that `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, and `even` is the original list of all even numbers greater than 0 in ascending order excluding the current `gap` and containing at least two elements.***
