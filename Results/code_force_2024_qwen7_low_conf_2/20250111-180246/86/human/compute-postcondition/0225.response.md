The code initializes an empty list called `odd`. This list does not depend on any of the existing variables (`t1`, `t2`, `ans`, `st`, `a`, `x`). Therefore, the only change is the creation of this new list.

Output State: **`t1` is `(a[x-1] + 1) \% n`, `t2` is `(a[x-1] + 2) \% n`, `ans` is `x` plus the number of times the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` was met, `st` is a set containing all unique elements from the list `a`, `odd` is an empty list**
