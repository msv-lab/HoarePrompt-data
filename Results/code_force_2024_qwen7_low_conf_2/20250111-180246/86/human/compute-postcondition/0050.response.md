Postcondition: ***`odd` contains its previous elements plus the new value `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise it retains its previous state; `even` contains the original elements plus `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even, otherwise it retains its previous state; `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`; `gap` is now `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; `next_elem` and `a[i]` retain their previous states.***
