The code reads three integers from the input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. The initial values of these variables are constrained as follows: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t > 0\); `n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\); `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\); `y` is an integer such that \(0 \leq y \leq n - x\). After executing the code, the values of `t`, `x`, and `y` are updated, but `n` is now a specific value from the input.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\) and \(t > 0\), `n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\) and is equal to the value read from input, `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\) and is equal to the value read from input, `y` is an integer such that \(0 \leq y \leq n - x\) and is equal to the value read from input.**
