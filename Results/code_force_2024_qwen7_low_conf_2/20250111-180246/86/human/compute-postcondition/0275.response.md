`y` is decreased by `gap // 2`. The value of `y` was previously defined as `0 - ((last_gap + 2) // 2) - (current_gap // 2)`, and if `y` was less than `gap // 2`, it would be updated to `2 * (0 - ((last_gap + 2) // 2) - (current_gap // 2))`, and the loop or if statement would be broken. However, since the code only updates `y` without checking the condition, the only change is in the value of `y`.

Output State: **`y` is `0 - ((last_gap + 2) // 2) - (current_gap // 2) - (gap // 2)`, `ans` is `ans + (last_gap + 2) + current_gap + gap`**
