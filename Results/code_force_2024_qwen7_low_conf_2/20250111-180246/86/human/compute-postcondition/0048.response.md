`gap` is appended to the list `even`. The value of `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not directly affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state is: `odd` contains `next_elem - a[i] - 1` if `next_elem - a[i] - 1` is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise it retains its previous state; `even` contains the original elements plus `gap`; `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`; `gap` is now `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.

Output State: **`odd` contains `next_elem - a[i] - 1` if `next_elem - a[i] - 1` is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise it retains its previous state; `even` contains the original elements plus `gap`; `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`; `gap` is now `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.**
