The code `odd.append(gap)` appends the current value of `gap` to the list `odd`. The value of `gap` before this operation is `-1`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `x` must be at least 1, `i` is `x`, `y` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `x + k`, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`, `odd` is now a list containing `-1`, `even` is unchanged, `next_elem` is `a[x]`, `gap` is `-1`.**
