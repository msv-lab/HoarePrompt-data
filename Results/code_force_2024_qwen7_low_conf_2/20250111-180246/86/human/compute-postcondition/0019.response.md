Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`.
   - `ans` is `x`.
   - `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`.
   - `x` is greater than 0.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`.
   - `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs for `i` in `range(x)`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1.

3. **Condition for Updating `ans`:**
   - If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is updated to `x`.

4. **States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` was checked.
   - If this condition was true, `ans` would be updated to `x`.
   - Otherwise, `ans`, `st`, `x`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2` would remain unchanged.

5. **Adjusting States for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop will execute one more time if `i` (which starts at 1) is less than `x`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 2.
   - `t1` and `t2` will be recalculated based on the updated value of `a[1]`.

6. **Conclusion:**
   - If the condition `t1 not in st and t2 in st` was not met in the previous iteration, all other states (`a`, `ans`, `st`, `x`, `t1`, `t2`) remain unchanged.
   - `i` is incremented to 2.

State: **`a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `ans` is `x`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`.
