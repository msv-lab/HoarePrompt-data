Postcondition: ***`odd` is a list containing the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd. Otherwise, `odd` is an empty list. `even` is a list containing `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even. Otherwise, `even` remains an empty list. `x` is greater than 0, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.***
