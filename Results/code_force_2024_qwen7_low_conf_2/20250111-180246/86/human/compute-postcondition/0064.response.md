The code `y = 0` assigns the value 0 to the variable `y`. The value of `ans` is dependent on the value of `next_odd_gap` and `y`, which were defined in the initial state but are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the only change is to the value of `y`.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is `ans + next_odd_gap + 2 * y`**
