Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 0; `i` is `x`; `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]`; `gap` is either `next_elem - a[x + 1] - 1` with `odd` being `[gap]` and `even` remaining unchanged, or `-1` with `odd` remaining unchanged and `even` being a list containing `-1`. This depends on whether `gap > 1` and `gap % 2 == 1` or `gap > 0` and `gap % 2 == 0` respectively.***
