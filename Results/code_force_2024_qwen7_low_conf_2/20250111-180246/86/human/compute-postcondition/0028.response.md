The given code snippet does not affect the variables `odd`, `even`, and `x`. The code snippet defines `next_elem` based on the conditions provided, but it does not assign `next_elem` to any variable or perform any operations that would change the state of `odd`, `even`, or `x`. The precondition that `x` must be greater than 0 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `x` must be greater than 0**
