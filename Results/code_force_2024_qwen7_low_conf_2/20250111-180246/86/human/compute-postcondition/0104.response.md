The code snippet `a = [(num - 1) for num in a]` iterates over each element in the list `a` and subtracts 1 from each element. The original list `a` is updated with these new values.

Let's denote the original list `a` as `[a1, a2, ..., an]` where each `ai` is an integer from the input split and converted using `map(int, input().split())`.

After executing the code, the new list `a` will be `[a1-1, a2-1, ..., an-1]`.

The other variables (`n`, `x`, `y`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is:

**`n` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input; `a` is a list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.**
