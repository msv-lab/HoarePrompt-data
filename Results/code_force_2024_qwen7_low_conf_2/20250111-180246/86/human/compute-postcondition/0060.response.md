`ans` is incremented by `gap`. The value of `y` does not affect this operation since the initial condition only mentions what happens if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, but the code does not depend on `y`'s value. Therefore, the only affected variable is `ans`.

Output State: **`y` is an integer; `ans` is `ans + gap`**
