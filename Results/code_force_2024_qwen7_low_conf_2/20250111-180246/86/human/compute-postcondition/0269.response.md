Let's break down the task step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `y` is `0 - ((last_gap + 2) // 2)`
   - `ans` is `ans + (last_gap + 2) + gap`

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for gap in odd:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Key Observations:**
   - The loop iterates over values in the `odd` sequence.
   - Inside the loop, `y` is modified by subtracting `gap // 2` from its current value.
   - `ans` is not modified inside the loop.

4. **Adjusting the States:**
   - At the start of the current iteration, the loop condition checks if the current value of `gap` (which is an odd number) is within the sequence.
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `gap` in the `odd` sequence must be used.
   - Since `y` is updated by subtracting `gap // 2` each time, we need to reflect this update in the state.
   - `ans` remains unchanged, so no adjustment is needed for `ans`.

5. **New State at the Start of the Next Iteration:**
   - `y` will be updated to `y - (next_gap // 2)` where `next_gap` is the next odd number in the sequence.
   - `ans` remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:
**`y` is `0 - ((last_gap + 2) // 2) - (current_gap // 2)`, `ans` is `ans + (last_gap + 2) + current_gap`**

Where `current_gap` is the next odd number in the sequence after `last_gap`.

So, the final state can be represented as:
**`y` is `0 - ((last_gap + 2) // 2) - (current_gap // 2)`, `ans` is `ans + (last_gap + 2) + current_gap`**
