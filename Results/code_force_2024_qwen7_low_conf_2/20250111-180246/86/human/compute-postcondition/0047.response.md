The code `odd.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. From the initial state, we know that `gap` is now `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Therefore, `odd` will have its last element updated to this new value.

- `odd` will have the new value `gap` appended to it.
- `even`, `x`, `i_prev`, `gap`, `next_elem`, and `a[i]` retain their previous states.

Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`odd` contains its previous elements plus the new value `gap`; `even` retains its previous state; `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`; `gap` is now `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; `next_elem` and `a[i]` retain their previous states.**
