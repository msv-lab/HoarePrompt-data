Postcondition: ***`y` is \(0 - \left(\frac{\text{last\_gap} + 2}{2}\right)\), `ans` is \(\text{ans} + (\text{last\_gap} + 2)\), `even` must have at least one element, and the first element of `even` has been processed. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, we break out of the most internal loop or switch statement. Otherwise, no change is made to `y` and `ans` remains as \(\text{ans} + (\text{last\_gap} + 2)\).***
