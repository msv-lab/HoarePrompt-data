The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to the list `a`. The values of these integers are determined by the input provided. The initial values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are replaced by the input values in the list `a`. Since the exact input values are not specified, we can represent the updated state using the input values.

Output State: **`t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are replaced by the values read from input and stored in the list `a`.**
