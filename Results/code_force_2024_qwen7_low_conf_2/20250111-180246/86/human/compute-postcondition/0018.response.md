Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `ans` is `x`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is updated to `x`. Otherwise, the values of `a`, `ans`, `st`, `x`, `i`, `t1`, and `t2` remain unchanged.***
