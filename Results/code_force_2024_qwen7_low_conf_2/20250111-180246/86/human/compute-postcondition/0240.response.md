The code `odd.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Given the precondition, `gap` is either odd and greater than 1, or it is a value that would make `odd` contain `[gap]`. The other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the updated state is that the list `odd` now contains the value of `gap`.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 0; `next_elem` is either `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, or `a[i + 1]` otherwise; `gap` is updated to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; the list `odd` contains `[gap]`.**
