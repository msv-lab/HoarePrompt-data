The initial state tells us that `y` is an integer equal to `y - (next_odd_gap // 2)` and `ans` is `ans + next_odd_gap`. The code snippet updates `ans` by adding `2 * y` to it. Since `y` is defined in terms of itself and `next_odd_gap`, let's break down the impact:

1. **Initial Values**:
   - `y = y - (next_odd_gap // 2)`
   - `ans = ans + next_odd_gap`

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `ans += 2 * y`

Since `y` is defined as `y - (next_odd_gap // 2)`, substituting this into the equation for `ans` gives:
   - `ans = ans + next_odd_gap + 2 * (y - (next_odd_gap // 2))`

Simplifying the expression:
   - `ans = ans + next_odd_gap + 2 * y - next_odd_gap`
   - `ans = ans + 2 * y`

Therefore, the updated value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `2 * y`.

Output State: **`y` is an integer equal to `y - (next_odd_gap // 2)`, `ans` is `ans + next_odd_gap + 2 * y`**
