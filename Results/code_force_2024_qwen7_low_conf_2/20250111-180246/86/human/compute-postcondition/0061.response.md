`y` is decremented by `gap // 2`. The initial state is that `y` is an integer and `ans` is `ans + gap`. Since the exact value of `ans` and `gap` is not specified, we can only say that `ans` is the sum of its previous value and `gap`. After executing the code, `y` is updated to `y - (gap // 2)`, while `ans` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is an integer equal to `y - (gap // 2)`, `ans` is `ans + gap`**
