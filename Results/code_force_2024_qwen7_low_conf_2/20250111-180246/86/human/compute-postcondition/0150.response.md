Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from input, `x` must be at least 1, `i` is `x - 1`, `y` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `x + k`, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n`, `odd` and `even` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` (`x - 1`), `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `(a[0] + n) - a[x - 1] - 1`. If `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, `odd` contains `[gap]`. If `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, `even` contains `[gap]`. Otherwise, `even` remains unchanged.***
