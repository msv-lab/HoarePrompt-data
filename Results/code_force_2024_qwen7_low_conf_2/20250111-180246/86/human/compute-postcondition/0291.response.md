`y` is decreased by `gap // 2`. The previous value of `y` was \(-\left(\frac{L + 2}{2}\right) - \left(G // 2\right)\). After the subtraction, the new value of `y` is \(-\left(\frac{L + 2}{2}\right) - \left(G // 2\right) - (gap // 2)\). The states of the other variables (`ans`, `even`, and `gap`) are not affected.

Output State: **`y` is \(-\left(\frac{L + 2}{2}\right) - \left(G // 2\right) - (gap // 2)\), `ans` is \(\text{ans} + (L + 2) + G + \text{gap}\), `even` must have at least two elements, and the second element of `even` has been processed.**
