`gap` is assigned the value of `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. We know that `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, so we can substitute this into the equation to get `gap = (a[0] + n) - a[i] - 1`. The value of `i` is `x - 1`, but the exact value of `x` and `a[i]` are not specified, so we keep them as they are. The other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `x` must be at least 1, `i` is `x - 1`, `y` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `x + k`, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `(a[0] + n) - a[i] - 1`**
