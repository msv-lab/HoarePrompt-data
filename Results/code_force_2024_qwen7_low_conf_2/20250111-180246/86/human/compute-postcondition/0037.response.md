Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `odd` is a list containing the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd. Otherwise, `odd` is an empty list.
- `even` is a list containing `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even. Otherwise, `even` remains an empty list.
- `x` is greater than 0.
- `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.

### Loop Statement:
```
for i in range(x):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**:
   - The loop will execute as long as `i < x`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is some value (let's call it `i_prev`), and `x` is greater than `i_prev`.

2. **Update Variables**:
   - In each iteration, `i` increases by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

3. **Checking the New Condition**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `x`.
   - This means `i_prev + 1 < x`, or equivalently, `i_prev < x - 1`.

4. **States to Adjust**:
   - `i` will be updated to `i_prev + 1`.
   - `x` remains unchanged and is still greater than `i_prev + 1`.

5. **List States**:
   - `odd` and `even` lists depend on the value of `gap`, which is `next_elem - a[i] - 1`.
   - Since `i` is now `i_prev + 1`, we need to update `gap` to `next_elem - a[i_prev + 1] - 1`.
   - If `next_elem - a[i_prev + 1] - 1` is greater than 1 and odd, it will be added to `odd`.
   - If `next_elem - a[i_prev + 1] - 1` is greater than 0 and even, it will be added to `even`.

### Final State Adjustment:

Given the above analysis, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:
- `i` is `i_prev + 1`.
- `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`.
- `odd` is updated based on the new `gap`.
- `even` is updated based on the new `gap`.

Since `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1` and we know `x` is greater than 0, we can summarize the required state adjustments as follows:

State: **`odd` is a list containing the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd. Otherwise, `odd` is an empty list. `even` is a list containing `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even. Otherwise, `even` remains an empty list. `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[i_prev + 1] - 1`.**
