The code updates the value of `t1` to `(a[i] + 1) % n`. Given the current state, `i` is 2, so `a[i]` corresponds to `a[2]`, which is `x-1` (since `a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`). Therefore, `t1` becomes `(x-1 + 1) % n`, which simplifies to `x % n`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `ans` is `x`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t1` is `x % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`.**
