To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's break down the information given and analyze the conditions required for the loop to start.

### Given Information:
- `odd` is a sorted list containing all values of `gap` such that `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd.
- `even` is a list containing all even numbers greater than 0 in ascending order.
- `x` is the number of iterations of the loop.

### Analysis:
- The loop iterates over each element in the `odd` list using the variable `gap`.
- For the loop to execute at least once, the `odd` list must contain at least one element.

### Steps:
1. **Check if the `odd` list contains elements**: 
   - Since `odd` is a list of odd numbers greater than 1, it will be empty if there are no such numbers. Therefore, the loop will not execute if `odd` is an empty list.
   
2. **Determine the initial state**:
   - The loop starts with the first element in the `odd` list. So, after the first iteration, `gap` will be set to the first element in the `odd` list.
   - Before the loop starts, we need to ensure that `odd` is not empty.

### Conclusion:
- The state needs to be adjusted to ensure that `odd` is not empty.

### Final State:
- `odd` must not be an empty list.
- `even` can be in any state as it is not relevant to the loop's execution.
- `x` (the number of iterations) is not directly relevant to whether the loop starts or not; it will be set based on the length of the `odd` list.

**State:**
**`odd` must not be an empty list**
