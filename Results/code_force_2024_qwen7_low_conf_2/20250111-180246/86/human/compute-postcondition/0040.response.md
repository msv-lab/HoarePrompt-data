`odd` appends the value of `gap` to itself. Since `odd` contains `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd; otherwise, it remains unchanged, and now `gap` is added to `odd`, the updated state of `odd` will be the current value of `odd` (if it exists) followed by `gap`. The values of `even`, `x`, `i_prev`, `a`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`odd` is the previous value of `odd` followed by `gap`, `even` contains `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even; otherwise, it remains unchanged; `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`; `gap` is `a[0] + n - a[i] - 1` if `i` equals `x - 1` and `a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1` otherwise.**
