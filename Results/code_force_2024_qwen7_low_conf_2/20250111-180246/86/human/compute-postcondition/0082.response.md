Postcondition: ***`y` is 0, `ans` is the sum of all `gap` values encountered in the loop, `odd` is the original list of all values of `gap` such that `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, `even` is the original list of all even numbers greater than 0 in ascending order, and `even` must contain at least one element. If `y < gap // 2` is true, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
