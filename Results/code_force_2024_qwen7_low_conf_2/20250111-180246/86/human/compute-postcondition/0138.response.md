`next_elem` is assigned the value of `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1`, otherwise, it is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`. 

- If `i == x - 1`, then `next_elem = a[0] + n`.
- Otherwise, `next_elem = a[i + 1]`.

Since the initial value of `i` is `x`, we need to consider two cases:

1. If `x - 1 == x`, which is impossible (since `x` is at least 1), then this case does not apply.
2. If `x - 1 != x`, then `i` is not equal to `x - 1`, so `next_elem = a[i + 1] = a[x]`.

Given that `i` is initially `x`, `i + 1` will be `x + 1`. Since `x` is at least 1, `x + 1` is a valid index in the list `a`.

Therefore, the value of `next_elem` is `a[x]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `x` must be at least 1, `i` is `x`, `y` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `x + k`, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`, `odd` and `even` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` (`x`); `next_elem` is `a[x]`.**
