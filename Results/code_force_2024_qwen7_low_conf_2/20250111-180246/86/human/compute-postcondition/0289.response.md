Postcondition: **`y` is \(-\left(\frac{L + 2}{2}\right) - \left(G // 2\right)\), `ans` is \(\text{ans} + (L + 2) + G\), `even` must have at least two elements, and the second element of `even` has been processed. If \(y < \text{gap} // 2\), then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
