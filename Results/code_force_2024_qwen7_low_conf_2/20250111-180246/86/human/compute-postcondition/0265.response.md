The `break` statement does not change the values of variables but indicates that we exit the loop or the most internal loop or conditional structure. In this case, since there are no loops or conditions directly involving `y` and `ans`, their values remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is `ans - (last_gap + 2)`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
