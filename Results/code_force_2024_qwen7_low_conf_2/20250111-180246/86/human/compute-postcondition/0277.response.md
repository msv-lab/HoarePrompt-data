To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step.

### Initial States
- `y` is \(0 - \sum_{i=0}^{\text{len(odd)}-1} \left(\frac{\text{odd}[i]}{2}\right)\).
- `ans` is \(\text{ans} + \sum_{i=0}^{\text{len(odd)}-1} (\text{last\_gap} + 2 + \text{odd}[i])\).

### Loop Condition
The loop is defined as:
```
for gap in even:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis
For the loop to execute, the list `even` must contain at least one element. If `even` is empty, the loop will not execute. 

### Adjusting States
1. **`y` State Adjustment:**
   - The value of `y` is dependent on the length of the `odd` list. Since the loop condition depends on `even`, the value of `y` should remain unchanged if the loop does not execute.
   - Therefore, `y` remains \(0 - \left(\frac{\text{last\_gap} + 2}{2}\right)\).

2. **`ans` State Adjustment:**
   - Similarly, the value of `ans` is dependent on the length of the `odd` list. If the loop does not execute, `ans` should remain unchanged.
   - Therefore, `ans` remains \(\text{ans} + (\text{last\_gap} + 2)\).

3. **Loop Execution Condition:**
   - For the loop to execute, the list `even` must have at least one element.
   - Therefore, `even` must have at least one element, and the first element of `even` is now being processed.

### Final Output State
Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`y` is \(0 - \left(\frac{\text{last\_gap} + 2}{2}\right)\), `ans` is \(\text{ans} + (\text{last\_gap} + 2)\), `even` must have at least one element, and the first element of `even` is now being processed.**

This ensures that the loop can start executing correctly.
