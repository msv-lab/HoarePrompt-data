The code `odd.append(gap)` appends the value of `gap` to the list `odd`. Since `gap` is already defined in the initial state and its value is greater than 1 and odd, appending it to `odd` does not change the values of the other variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 0; `next_elem` is either `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, or `a[i + 1]` otherwise; `gap` is either `(a[0] + n) - a[i] - 1` if `i` equals `x - 1`, or `a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1` otherwise; the current value of `gap` is greater than 1 and `gap` is odd; `odd` contains `[gap]`**
