`ans` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `ans` is `x - 1`. Since `x` is greater than 0, the initial value of `ans` is a positive integer. After incrementing, `ans` becomes `(x - 1) + 1`, which simplifies to `x`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `ans` is `x`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`**
