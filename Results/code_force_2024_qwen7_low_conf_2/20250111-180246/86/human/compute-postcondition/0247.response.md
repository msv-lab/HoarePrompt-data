`odd` is appended with the value of `gap`. Given that `gap` is defined as `next_elem - a[x + 1] - 1`, and this value is added to `odd`, the value of `odd` changes accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 0; `i` is `x`; `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[x + 1] - 1`; `odd` is `[gap]`; `even` remains unchanged.**
