The code `break` does not change the values of the variables `y` and `ans`. It simply breaks out of the nearest enclosing loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given initial state, the `break` statement here does not affect the variables.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is `ans` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
