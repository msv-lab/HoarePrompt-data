Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from input, `x` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1 (`x + 1`), `y` is an integer from input minus `gap`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `gap`, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one pair of elements with an odd gap greater than 1, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`, and `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, with one less element. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `gap` plus 2 times `integer_from_input` minus 2 times `gap`. Otherwise, the values of `y` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
