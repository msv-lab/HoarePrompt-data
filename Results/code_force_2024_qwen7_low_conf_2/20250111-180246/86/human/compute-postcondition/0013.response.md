Postcondition: ***`a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `ans` is `x - 1`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t1` is `t % n`, `t2` is `(t+1) % n`, and if `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is updated to `x - 1`. Otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
