The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it is implied that the function processes multiple test cases, where each test case consists of three integers: `t`, `n`, and `x`, along with an additional integer `y`. The constraints for these parameters are as follows:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 10^4\).
- For each test case, `n` is an integer such that \(4 \leq n \leq 10^9\).
- `x` is an integer such that \(2 \leq x \leq \min(n, 2 \cdot 10^5)\).
- `y` is an integer such that \(0 \leq y \leq n - x\).

Additionally, the vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by `x` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and the sum of `x` over all test cases does not exceed \(2 \cdot 10^5\).

Based on the given output cases, the function has two possible return values:
- **Case_1:** If the condition for the current test case is not met (i.e., the input does not satisfy the constraints), the function returns an appropriate message or value indicating the failure.
- **Case_2:** If the condition for the current test case is met (i.e., the input satisfies the constraints), the function returns a result based on the specific logic implemented for processing the test case.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process multiple test cases, each consisting of integers `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y`, and return either an error message or a result based on the satisfaction of given constraints and internal logic.
