The code `ans += 1` increments the value of `ans` by 1. The initial state shows that `t1` is \((a[i] + 1) \% n\) and `t2` is \((a[i] + 2) \% n\). The value of `ans` remains unchanged unless the new condition (new `t1` not in `st` and new `t2` in `st`) is met, but since no such condition is mentioned or evaluated in the given code, `ans` is simply incremented by 1.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t1` is \((a[i] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[i] + 2) \% n\), `ans` is `ans` + 1**
