`y` is assigned the value `0`. The initial state was that `y` is an integer less than `gap // 2` and `ans` is `ans` plus `2 * y`. Since `y` is now `0`, `ans` remains unchanged because `2 * 0` is `0`. Therefore, the output state is: `y` is `0`, and `ans` is still `ans` plus `0`, which means `ans` remains the same as its initial value.

Output State: **`y` is `0`, `ans` is `ans`**
