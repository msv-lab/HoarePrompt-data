Output State: **`y` is adjusted according to the condition `y < gap // 2`; if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is set to `0` and `ans` is updated to `ans + next_odd_gap + new_gap`, otherwise `y` is set to `y - (new_gap // 2)` and `ans` is updated to `ans + new_gap`; `ans` is incremented by `gap`**
