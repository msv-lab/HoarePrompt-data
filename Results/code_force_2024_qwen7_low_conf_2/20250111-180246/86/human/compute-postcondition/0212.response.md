`ans` is incremented by 1. The values of `t1` and `t2` remain unchanged as they were not affected by the code. The conditions of `t1` and `t2` with respect to the set `st` also remain the same.

Output State: **`t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `ans` is incremented by 1, `t1` is not in `st`, and `t2` is in `st`**
