The code updates the value of `next_elem` based on the condition whether `i` is equal to `x - 1`. However, the initial state does not specify the exact values of `a`, `i`, `i_prev`, `x`, and `n`. Let's break down the impact:

1. The value of `next_elem` is updated to `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1`.
2. If `i` is not equal to `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is updated to `a[i + 1]`.
3. The values of `odd`, `even`, `x`, `i_prev`, `gap`, and `a` remain unchanged.

Since we don't know the exact values of `a`, `i`, `i_prev`, `x`, and `n`, we can only express `next_elem` in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`odd` is a list containing the value of `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd. Otherwise, `odd` is an empty list. `even` is a list containing `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even. Otherwise, `even` remains an empty list. `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[i_prev + 1] - 1`; `next_elem` is `a[0] + n` if `i` is equal to `x - 1` and `a[i + 1]` otherwise.**
