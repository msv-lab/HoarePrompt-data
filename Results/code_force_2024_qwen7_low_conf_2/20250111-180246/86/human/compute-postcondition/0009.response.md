Given the initial state:
- `a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`
- `ans` is `x - 2`
- `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`
- `x` is greater than 0
- `i` is 0

The code snippet is:
```
t1 = (a[i] + 1) % n
```

Step-by-step analysis:
1. Since `i` is 0, `a[i]` refers to the first element of the list `a`.
2. The first element of `a` is `t-1` (since `a` is `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]` and it is sorted).
3. Thus, `a[i]` is `t-1`.
4. The expression `(a[i] + 1) % n` becomes `((t-1) + 1) % n`, which simplifies to `t % n`.
5. This value is assigned to `t1`.

The output state will include the updated value of `t1` and the unchanged values of the other variables.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `t1` is `t % n`**
