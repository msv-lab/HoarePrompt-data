The code `ans += gap` adds the value of `gap` to `ans`. 

- If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is 0 and `ans` is updated to `ans + next_odd_gap + 2 * y`, which simplifies to `ans + next_odd_gap` since `y` is 0.
- If `y` is not less than `gap // 2`, then the values of `y` and `ans` remain as per the precondition.

In both cases, the new value of `ans` is the previous value of `ans` plus `gap`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is an integer, if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is 0 and `ans` is `ans + next_odd_gap + gap`, otherwise `ans` is `ans + gap`.

Output State: **`y` is an integer, if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is 0 and `ans` is `ans + next_odd_gap + gap`, otherwise `ans` is `ans + gap`**
