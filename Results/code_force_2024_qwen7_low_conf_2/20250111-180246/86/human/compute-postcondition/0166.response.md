Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from input, `x` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1 (i.e., `x + 1`), `y` is an integer from input minus `gap // 2`. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` is set to 0, and `ans` is updated to `x + k + odd[0] + 2 * (integer from input - gap // 2)`. If `y` is not less than `gap // 2`, no changes are made to `y` and `ans`. `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one pair of elements with an odd gap greater than 1, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`, and `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, and it must be non-empty.***
