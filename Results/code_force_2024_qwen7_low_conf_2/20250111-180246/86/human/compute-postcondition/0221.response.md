`t2` is reassigned the value `(a[i] + 2) % n`. The previous value of `t2` was \((a[i+1] + 2) \% n\). Therefore, the new value of `t2` is \((a[i] + 2) \% n\). The values of `t1` and `ans` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t1` is \((a[i] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[i] + 2) \% n\), `ans` remains unchanged**
