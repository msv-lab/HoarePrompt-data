The code sets `y` to 0, which changes its value from \(-\left(\frac{L + 2}{2}\right) - \left(G // 2\right)\). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is \(\text{ans} + (L + 2) + G\), `even` must have at least two elements, and the second element of `even` has been processed.**
