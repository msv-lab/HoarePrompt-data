`y` is decreased by `gap // 2`. The previous value of `y` was `an integer from input minus gap // 2`, so after subtracting `gap // 2` again, the new value of `y` becomes `an integer from input minus gap`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `x` is the number of times the loop executed plus 1 (`x + 1`), `y` is an integer from input minus `gap`, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus `gap`, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one pair of elements with an odd gap greater than 1, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`, and `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, and it must be non-empty.**
