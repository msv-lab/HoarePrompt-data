The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead exits the loop or the most internal block it is in. Since there is no loop or block being exited in this context other than the implied one from the initial state, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is `ans + (last_gap + 2) + current_gap`, `ans` is `ans + 2 * (0 - ((last_gap + 2) // 2) - (current_gap // 2))` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
