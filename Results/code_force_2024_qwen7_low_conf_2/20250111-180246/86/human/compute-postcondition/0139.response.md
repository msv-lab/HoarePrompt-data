`gap` is assigned the value of `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Given the initial state, `next_elem` is `a[x]`, and `i` is `x`. So, `gap` is calculated as `a[x] - a[x] - 1`, which simplifies to `-1`.

The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `x` must be at least 1, `i` is `x`, `y` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `x + k`, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`, `odd` and `even` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` (`x`), `next_elem` is `a[x]`, `gap` is `-1`.**
