Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from input, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `ans` is `x + 1`, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates and maintaining the uniqueness of its elements, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `i` is `i + 4`, and `t2` is updated to `(a[i] + 2) % n`. If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is updated to `x + 1`; otherwise, the values remain unchanged.***
