The given code snippet calculates `t1` as `(a[i] + 1) % n`. However, there are no initial values provided for `a`, `i`, and `n`. Therefore, we can only express `t1` in terms of these variables.

- `a[i]` is added by 1.
- The result is taken modulo `n`.

Since the initial values of `a`, `i`, and `n` are not specified, the output state will be expressed in terms of these variables.

Output State: **`t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`**
