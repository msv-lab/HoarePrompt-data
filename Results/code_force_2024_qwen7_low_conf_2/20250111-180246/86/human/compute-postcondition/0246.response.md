`gap` is assigned the value `next_elem - a[i] - 1`. Given the initial state, `a[i]` is `a[x + 1]`, so the value of `gap` becomes `next_elem - a[x + 1] - 1`. The other variables (`x`, `i`, `next_elem`, `odd`, and `even`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 0; `i` is `x`; `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]`; `gap` is `next_elem - a[x + 1] - 1`; `odd` remains unchanged; `even` remains unchanged.**
