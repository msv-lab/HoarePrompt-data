The code appends the value of `gap` to the list `even`. Given the initial state, `gap` is defined as `next_elem - a[x + 1] - 1`. Since `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]`, the expression simplifies to `gap = a[x + 1] - a[x + 1] - 1 = -1`. Therefore, `even` will append `-1` to its list.

Output State: **`x` is greater than 0; `i` is `x`; `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]`; `gap` is `-1`; `odd` remains unchanged; `even` is a list containing `-1`.**
