Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 0; `i` is `x`; `next_elem` is `a[x + 1]`; `gap` is `-1`; `odd` remains unchanged; `even` is a list containing `-1`. This occurs if and only if `gap > 0` and `gap % 2 == 0`. Otherwise, the values of `x`, `i`, `next_elem`, `gap`, `odd`, and `even` remain as they were before the if-else block executes.***
