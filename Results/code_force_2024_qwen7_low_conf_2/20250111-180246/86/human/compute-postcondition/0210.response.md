`t2` is assigned the value `(a[i] + 2) % n`. The value of `a[i]` is part of the calculation for `t1`, which is `(a[i] + 1) % n`. Since `a[i]` is the same in both expressions, `t1` and `t2` are related by the fact that `t2` is simply `t1 + 1` modulo `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`.

Output State: **`t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`; `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`**
