`ans` is incremented by `gap`, and the value of `y` does not change because the condition `y < gap // 2` is not met (since `y` is 0 and `gap // 2` would be greater than 0). Therefore, the Output State is: `y` is 0, `ans` is `ans + gap`, and the most internal loop or if statement is not broken.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is `ans + gap`, and the most internal loop or if statement is not broken.**
