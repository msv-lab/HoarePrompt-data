Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial States at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `odd` contains `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise it retains its previous state.
   - `even` contains `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even, otherwise it retains its previous state.
   - `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`.
   - `gap` is `a[0] + n - a[i] - 1` if `i` equals `x - 1` and `a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1` otherwise.

2. **For Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for i in range(x):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Step-by-Step Analysis:**
   - The loop iterates from `i = 0` to `i = x - 1`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` was equal to `i_prev`, and now `i` will be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i_prev + 1`.

4. **Update States:**
   - `odd` and `even` retain their previous states unless `gap` changes within the loop.
   - `x` remains unchanged as it is determined before the loop starts.
   - `gap` is updated based on the value of `i`:
     - If `i` is equal to `x - 1`, then `gap` is `a[0] + n - a[i] - 1`.
     - Otherwise, `gap` is `a[i + 1] - a[i] - 1`.

5. **Conclusion:**
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1, we need to check the condition for `i` being `x - 1` or `i` being any other value to update `gap`.
   - If `i` becomes `x - 1` in this iteration, `gap` will be updated accordingly.
   - If `i` is not `x - 1`, `gap` will remain the same.

Given the above analysis, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `i` becomes `i_prev + 1`.
- `gap` will be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Therefore, the new state should be:

**State: **`odd` contains `gap` if `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, otherwise it retains its previous state. `even` contains `gap` if `gap` is greater than 0 and even, otherwise it retains its previous state. `x` is greater than `i_prev + 1`; `gap` is updated based on whether `i` equals `x - 1` or not, where `i` is now `i_prev + 1`.**
