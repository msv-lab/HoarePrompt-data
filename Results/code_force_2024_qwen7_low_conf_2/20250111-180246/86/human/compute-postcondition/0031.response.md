`odd` is appended with the value of `gap`. The value of `gap` is greater than 1 and odd, so `odd` will now contain this specific odd number. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`odd` is an empty list plus the value of `gap`, `even` is an empty list, `x` is greater than 0, and `gap` is `next_elem - a[i] - 1` and is greater than 1 and odd.**
