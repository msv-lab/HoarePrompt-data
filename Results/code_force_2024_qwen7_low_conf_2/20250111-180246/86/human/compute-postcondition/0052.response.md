The code `odd.sort()` sorts the list `odd`. This operation does not affect the list `even` or the variable `x`. After sorting, the elements in the `odd` list will be arranged in ascending order.

Output State: **`odd` is a sorted list containing all values of `gap` such that `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd, `even` is a list containing all values of `gap` such that `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, and `x` is the number of iterations of the loop.**
