Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from input, `x` must be at least 1, `i` is `x`, `y` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `x + k`, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[x] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[x] + 2) % n`, `odd` and `even` will be recalculated based on the new value of `i` (`x`), `next_elem` is `a[x]`, `gap` is `-1`; if `gap > 0` and `gap % 2 == 0`, `even` is updated by appending `-1` to it. Otherwise, the value of `even` remains unchanged.***
