The code assigns a value to `next_elem` based on the condition. Since `x` must be greater than 0, let's analyze the code:

- If `i` is equal to `x - 1`, then `next_elem` is assigned the value of `a[0] + n`.
- Otherwise, `next_elem` is assigned the value of `a[i + 1]`.

The variables `x`, `a`, `n`, and `i` are involved in this calculation. However, their specific values are not provided. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `next_elem`. But we know that `next_elem` will be one of these two expressions depending on the value of `i` relative to `x - 1`.

The initial conditions remain valid after the code executes. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`x` must be greater than 0; `next_elem` is either `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, or `a[i + 1]` otherwise**.
