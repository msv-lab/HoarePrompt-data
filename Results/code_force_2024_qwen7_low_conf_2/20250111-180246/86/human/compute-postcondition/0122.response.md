`ans` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus 1. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `ans` is `x` + 1, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates and maintaining the uniqueness of its elements, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `i` is `i + 4`, and `t2` is updated to `(a[i] + 2) % n`.**
