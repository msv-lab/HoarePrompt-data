The code `ans += gap` increments the value of `ans` by the value of `gap`. The other variables (`y`, `last_gap`, `current_gap`) are not affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the value of `ans` is updated to its current value plus `gap`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is `0 - ((last_gap + 2) // 2) - (current_gap // 2)`, `ans` is `ans + (last_gap + 2) + current_gap + gap`, if `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is updated to `2 * (0 - ((last_gap + 2) // 2) - (current_gap // 2))` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the values of `y` and `ans` remain as they are after the loop iteration.**
