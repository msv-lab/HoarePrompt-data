Let's go through the code step by step:

1. The initial state is given as:
   - `a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`
   - `ans` is `x`
   - `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`
   - `x` is greater than 0
   - `i` is 2
   - `t1` is `x % n`
   - `t2` is `(a[1] + 2) % n`

2. The code snippet provided is:
   ```python
   t2 = (a[i] + 2) % n
   ```

3. Let's break down the impact of this line:
   - `i` is 2, so `a[i]` refers to the third element in the list `a`. Since `a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `a[2]` is `y-1`.
   - Therefore, `t2` is assigned the value of `(y-1 + 2) % n`, which simplifies to `(y-1 + 2) % n`.

4. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `ans` is `x`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `t1` is `x % n`, `t2` is `(y-1 + 2) % n`**
