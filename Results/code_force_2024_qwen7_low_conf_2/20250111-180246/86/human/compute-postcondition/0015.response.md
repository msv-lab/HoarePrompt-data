Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `ans` is `x - 1`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `x` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `t1` is `(a[1] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(t+1) % n`**

Explanation:
- The initial state is given, including the sorted list `a`, the variable `ans`, the set `st`, and other variables.
- The code snippet updates the value of `t1` to `(a[i] + 1) % n`. Since `i` is 1, `a[i]` is the second element of the list `a`, which is `n-1`.
- Therefore, `t1` is calculated as `(n-1 + 1) % n`, which simplifies to `n % n`, resulting in `0`.
- The value of `t1` is updated, while the other variables remain unchanged as per the initial state.
