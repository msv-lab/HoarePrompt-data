`t2` is updated to the value `(a[i] + 2) % n`. The previous value of `t2` was `(a[i+1] + 2) % n`, but now it has been changed. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t1` is \((a[i] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[i] + 2) \% n\), `ans` remains unchanged unless the new condition (new `t1` not in `st` and new `t2` in `st`) is met.**
