The `break` statement does not affect the values of variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block that is active in this context, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is `ans + 2 * (0 - (new_gap // 2))` if `new_gap // 2` is `0` and otherwise `ans`.**
