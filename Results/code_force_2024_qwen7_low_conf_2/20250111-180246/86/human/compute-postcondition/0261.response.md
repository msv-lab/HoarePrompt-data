`y` is decreased by `gap // 2`. The value of `ans` remains unchanged because the code snippet only affects `y`. The value of `ans` was initially set as `ans + gap`, and since no further operations on `ans` are performed, `ans` still holds the value of `ans + gap`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`y` is 0 - `gap // 2`, `ans` is `ans + gap`**
