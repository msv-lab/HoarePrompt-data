Postcondition: ***`x` is greater than 0; `next_elem` is either `a[0] + n` if `i` equals `x - 1`, or `a[i + 1]` otherwise; `gap` is updated to `next_elem - a[i] - 1`; `odd` contains `[gap]` if `gap > 1` and `gap` is odd; `even` contains the value of `gap` if `gap > 0` and `gap` is even, otherwise `even` remains unchanged.***

This postcondition summarizes the overall state of the program after the if-else block executes, considering both the if and else parts.
