`t` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `n`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged, and the conditions they must satisfy are preserved. The output state includes the updated value of `t`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that 1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4 and `t` is the input integer, `n`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, 2 ≤ x ≤ min(n, 2⋅10^5), and 0 ≤ y ≤ n - x, and the vertices Bessie has chosen are represented by x distinct integers from 1 to n.**
