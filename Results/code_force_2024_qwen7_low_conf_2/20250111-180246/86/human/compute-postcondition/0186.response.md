The code snippet `ans += 2 * y` updates the value of `ans` by adding `2 * y` to its current value. Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer from input
- `x` is the number of times the loop executed (which is the length of the list `odd`)
- `y` is an integer from input minus the sum of all gaps divided by 2 minus `gap // 2`
- `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one pair of elements with an odd gap greater than 1
- `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the sum of all gaps in `odd` plus the current value of `gap`
- `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates
- `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n` if the loop executed
- `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n` if the loop executed
- `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, with no elements remaining
- `even` contains at least one element

The variable `ans` is updated, while the other variables remain unchanged. The updated value of `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the sum of all gaps in `odd` plus the current value of `gap` plus `2 * y`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `x` is the number of times the loop executed (which is the length of the list `odd`), `y` is an integer from input minus the sum of all gaps divided by 2 minus `gap // 2`, `a` is a sorted list of integers with at least one pair of elements with an odd gap greater than 1, `ans` is the original value of `ans` plus the sum of all gaps in `odd` plus the current value of `gap` plus `2 * y`, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n` if the loop executed, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n` if the loop executed, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, with no elements remaining, `even` contains at least one element.**
