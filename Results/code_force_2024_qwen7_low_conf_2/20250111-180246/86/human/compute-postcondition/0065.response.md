The `break` statement does not affect the values of the variables, it only exits the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code snippet, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`y` is 0, `ans` is `ans + next_odd_gap + 2 * y`**
