Postcondition: ***`y` is `0 - ((last_gap + 2) // 2) - (current_gap // 2)`, `ans` is `ans + (last_gap + 2) + current_gap`. If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` is updated to `2 * (0 - ((last_gap + 2) // 2) - (current_gap // 2))` and the most internal loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, the values of `y` and `ans` remain as they are after the loop iteration.***
