To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop condition.

### Given Information:
- At the end of the previous iteration:
  - `t1` is \((a[i] + 1) \% n\)
  - `t2` is \((a[i] + 2) \% n\)
- The condition for incrementing `ans`:
  - If `t1` is not in `st` and `t2` is in `st`, then `ans` is incremented by 1.
- Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### Loop Condition:
The loop iterates over `i` from `0` to `x-1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Loop Execution Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as `i < x`.

2. **Current State After Previous Iteration**:
   - `t1` = \((a[i] + 1) \% n\)
   - `t2` = \((a[i] + 2) \% n\)
   - `ans` is incremented based on the condition mentioned above.

3. **Next Iteration**:
   - For the next iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` will be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new values of `t1` and `t2` will be:
     - New `t1` = \((a[i+1] + 1) \% n\)
     - New `t2` = \((a[i+1] + 2) \% n\)

4. **Condition for Incrementing `ans` in Next Iteration**:
   - The same condition will be checked: if `new t1` is not in `st` and `new t2` is in `st`, then `ans` will be incremented by 1.
   - Otherwise, the state remains unchanged.

### Final Answer:

State: **`t1` is \((a[i+1] + 1) \% n\), `t2` is \((a[i+1] + 2) \% n\), `ans` remains unchanged unless the new condition (new `t1` not in `st` and new `t2` in `st`) is met.**

In summary, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:
- `t1` changes to \((a[i+1] + 1) \% n\)
- `t2` changes to \((a[i+1] + 2) \% n\)
