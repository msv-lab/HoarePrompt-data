Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer from input, `x` is the number of times the loop executed (non-negative), `y` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers that contains at least one pair of elements with an odd gap greater than 1, `ans` is `x + k`, where `k` is at least 1, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[x - 1] + 1) % n` if the loop executed, `t2` is `(a[x - 1] + 2) % n` if the loop executed, `odd` is a sorted list of all gaps greater than 1 and odd, and it must be non-empty. If `y < gap // 2`, then `y` remains the same. Otherwise, no changes are made to `y`.***
