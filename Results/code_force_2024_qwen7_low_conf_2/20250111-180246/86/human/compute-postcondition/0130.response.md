Postcondition: **`n` is an integer from input, `x` must be at least 1, `i` is `x - 1`, `y` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `ans` is `x + k`, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is `(a[i] + 2) % n`, `odd` is an empty list, `even` is an empty list, `next_elem` is `a[0] + n`, `gap` is `(a[0] + n) - a[i] - 1`, and the `gap` is greater than 1 and `gap` is odd**
