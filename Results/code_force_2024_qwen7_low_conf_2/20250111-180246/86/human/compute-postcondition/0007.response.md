`a` is a list containing the values `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`. After sorting, the list `a` will be rearranged in ascending order. The other variables (`ans` and `st`) are not affected by this operation.

Let's assume the initial values of `t`, `n`, `x`, and `y` are such that the sorted list `a` will be `[min(t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1), second smallest among (t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1), third smallest among (t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1), max(t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1)]`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` is `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`
- `ans` is `x - 2`
- `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`

After executing `a.sort()`, the values in `a` will be sorted, and `ans` and `st` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`, `ans` is `x - 2`, `st` is a set containing unique elements from `[t-1, n-1, x-1, y-1]`**
