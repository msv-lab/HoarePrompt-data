The code reads three integers from input and assigns them to the variables `n`, `x`, and `y`. Since no specific values are provided for the input, the variables will be assigned the integer values of the input. Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `x` is an integer from input, `y` is an integer from input**
