Postcondition: ***`y` is \(-\left(\frac{L + 2}{2}\right) - \left(G // 2\right) - (\text{next_gap} // 2)\), `ans` is updated to \(\text{ans} + (L + 2) + G + \text{next_gap}\). If `y` is less than `gap // 2`, then `y` becomes 0 and `ans` is further updated to \(\text{ans} + 2 \times \left(-\left(\frac{L + 2}{2}\right) - \left(G // 2\right) - (\text{next_gap} // 2)\right)\). `even` must still have at least 3 elements, and the third element of `even` has been processed.***
