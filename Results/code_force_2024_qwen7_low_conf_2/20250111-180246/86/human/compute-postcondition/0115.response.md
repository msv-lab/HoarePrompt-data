`t1` is assigned the value `(a[i] + 1) % n`. Since `i` is `i+1`, we know `i` was originally `i+1 - 1 = i`. So, `a[i]` is the element in list `a` at index `i`. Given that `t2 = (a[i+1] + 2) % n`, `a[i]` is one less than `a[i+1]` because `a` is a list where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`.

Since `t2` is in `st` and `t1` is not in `st`, `t1` is different from `t2`. All other variables are not affected.

To calculate `t1` more specifically, let's denote `a[i]` as `ai`. Thus, `t1 = (ai + 1) % n`.

The output state is:
- `n` is an integer from input
- `x` is greater than or equal to 1
- `y` is an integer from input
- `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`
- `ans` is `x - 1`
- `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates and maintaining the uniqueness of its elements
- `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`
- `t2` is in `st`
- `i` is `i + 1`
- `t2 = (a[i+1] + 2) % n`

Output State: **`n` is an integer from input, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `y` is an integer from input, `a` is a sorted list of integers where each element is one less than the corresponding element in the original list `a`, `ans` is `x - 1`, `st` is a set created from the list `a` without duplicates and maintaining the uniqueness of its elements, `t1` is `(a[i] + 1) % n`, `t2` is in `st`, `i` is `i + 1`, and `t2 = (a[i+1] + 2) % n**
