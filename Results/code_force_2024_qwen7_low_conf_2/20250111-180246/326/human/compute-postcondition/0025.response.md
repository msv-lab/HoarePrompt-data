The code `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])` attempts to remove the element at index `0 * 2` (which is 0) from the list `lst`. However, the initial state does not specify what `lst` contains or its initial value. Given that `i` is set to `n * 2`, and since `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is even. But this does not affect the list operation directly unless we know the contents of `lst`.

Since the initial state does not specify the contents of `lst`, and there's no direct impact on `t`, `ans`, or `n` from this operation, the only thing we can determine is the removal of the first element from `lst`. 

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is double its initial value, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is \(n * 2\); `lst` has had its first element removed.**
