The code removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is index 0) from the list `lst`. Since the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, and `lst` is split from `l`, it means `lst` contains at least 3 elements. Removing the first element (`lst[0]`) from `lst` changes the list.

- `ans` remains unchanged because the operation does not involve `ans`.
- `n` remains unchanged because the operation does not involve `n`.
- `t` remains unchanged because the operation does not involve `t`.
- The length of `lst` decreases by 1.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is equal to the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `lst` is a list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with its length reduced by 1, and the first element of `lst` is removed.**
