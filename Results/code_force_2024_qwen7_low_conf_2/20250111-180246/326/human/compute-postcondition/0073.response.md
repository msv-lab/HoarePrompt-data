The code snippet updates the value of `ans` by adding the minimum of the two integers converted from the first and second elements of the list `lst`. Given that `lst` has a length of 2, the code is effectively comparing `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` and adding the smaller of the two to `ans`.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. `ans` is initially 0.
2. The code snippet `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` adds the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to `ans`.

Since `lst` is a list of two strings obtained by splitting the input string `l` by spaces, and `l` was input by the user, let's denote the first element of `lst` as `a` and the second element as `b`. Thus, `ans` is updated to be `min(a, b)`.

The initial state of `ans` is 0, and now it is updated to the minimum of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`, and the length of `lst` is 2.**
