The code `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the string `l` by spaces and assigns the resulting list to `lst`. This changes the value of `lst` to a list of substrings from `l` separated by spaces. The other variables (`t`, `ans`, `n`, `i`, `ans_f`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` (or the single remaining element if `lst` has only one element) until the conditions of the loop no longer hold; `n` is the integer input by the user; `i` is \(2(n + 1)\); `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces; `ans_f` is a list containing `0`; `l` is a string input by the user.**
