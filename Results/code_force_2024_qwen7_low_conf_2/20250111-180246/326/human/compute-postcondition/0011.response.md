The code removes the second element (index 1) from the list `lst`. Let's go through this step by step:

1. Initially, `lst` is a list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, and its length is reduced by 1, and the first element of `lst` is removed. So, `lst` is a list of integers starting from the second element of the split result.
2. The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 (since `1 * 2` equals 2) from the list `lst`.

Since `lst` initially starts from the second element and each subsequent element in the list represents the next integer in the original list after the first element is removed, removing the element at index 2 means removing the third element from the original list.

Given that the initial state of `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is equal to the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `lst` is a list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with its length reduced by 1 and the first element of `lst` is removed, the only thing that changes is the removal of the third element from the list.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is equal to the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` with the third element removed, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `lst` has the third element removed.**
