The code `l = input()` reads a line of input from the user and assigns it to the variable `l`. This operation does not affect the values of the other variables. Therefore, the only change is that `l` now holds the input from the user.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans` is 0; `n` is the integer input by the user; `i` is \(2n + 3\); `l` is the string input by the user; `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces; `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`; `l` is the input string from the user.**
