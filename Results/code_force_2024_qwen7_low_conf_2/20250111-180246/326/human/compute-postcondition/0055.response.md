First, let's analyze the initial state and the given Python code snippet:

- Initial State: `total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 2\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces if `len(lst)` is not 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `0`, `ans` is `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.

Given code:
```python
lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])
```

Step-by-step analysis:

1. **Understanding the index in `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])`:**
   - The expression `0 * 2` evaluates to `0`.
   - Hence, `lst.remove(lst[0])` is executed, which removes the first element from the list `lst`.

2. **Impact on `lst` and `ans`:**
   - Since `lst` is a list of strings, removing the first element (which is `lst[0]`) affects the length and content of the list.
   - After removing the first element, the value of `ans` needs to be recalculated since it depends on the first two elements of `lst`.

3. **Revisiting the definition of `ans`:**
   - Initially, `ans` was defined as `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
   - After removal, `ans` should now be recalculated as `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if `lst` has at least two elements.

4. **Updating the state:**
   - `total` remains unchanged: `total` is 10.
   - `i` remains unchanged because it is dependent on `n`, which is not modified.
   - `l` remains unchanged.
   - `lst` loses its first element, and `ans` is recalculated based on the new list.
   - `ans_f` remains unchanged: `ans_f` is `[0]`.

Since the exact value of `l` is not specified, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `lst` or `ans`. However, we know that the first element of `lst` has been removed, and `ans` will be recalculated based on the remaining elements.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 2\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed, `ans_f` is [0], `ans` is `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if `lst` has at least two elements, otherwise `ans` is undefined.**
