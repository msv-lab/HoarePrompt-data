`lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, and its length is not equal to 2. The code removes the element at index `0 * 2`, which is the same as removing the element at index `0`. The initial state does not specify the exact contents of `lst`, but it implies that the first element of `lst` is removed.

After executing `lst.remove(lst[0 * 2])`, the first element of `lst` is removed, but the specific content of `lst` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact elements in the list post-execution. However, we know that the length of `lst` is now one less than before, and the first element is gone.

The other variables remain unchanged:
- `total` is still 10.
- `i` is still \(2(n + 1)\).
- `n` remains the integer input by the user.
- `l` is still the string input by the user.
- `ans_f` is still `[0]`.
- `ans` is still the sum of `ans` and the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1)\), `n` is an integer input by the user, `l` is a string input by the user, the length of `lst` is one less than before and the first element is removed, `ans_f` is `[0]`, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers.**
