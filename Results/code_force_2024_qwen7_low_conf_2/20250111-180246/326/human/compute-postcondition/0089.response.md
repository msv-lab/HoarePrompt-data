Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is updated according to the following rules: if the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is incremented by the minimum value of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`; if the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is incremented by the minimum value of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing 0 and the updated `ans`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`. Additionally, if the length of `lst` is not 2, the element at index 2 is removed from `lst`.***
