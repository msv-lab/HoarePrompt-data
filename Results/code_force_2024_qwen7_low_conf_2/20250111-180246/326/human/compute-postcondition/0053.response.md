Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `total` is 10
- `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\)
- `l` is a string input by the user
- `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces if `len(lst)` is not 2
- `ans_f` is a list containing `0`
- `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`
- If `len(lst)` is 2, `lst` has its third element (if exists) removed, `ans_f` is `[0]`, and `ans` is `1`

### For Loop:
```
for i in range(n * 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Determine the Condition for the Next Iteration:**
   - The loop condition is `i < n * 2`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\).

2. **Check if the Next Iteration Can Execute:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than \(n \times 2\).
   - Therefore, the next value of `i` should be \(2(n + 1) + 2\).

3. **Adjust the States:**
   - `total` remains the same: `total` is still 10.
   - `i` is updated to \(2(n + 1) + 2\).
   - The other states (`l`, `lst`, `ans_f`, and `ans`) remain unchanged because the loop body is omitted, and there are no operations that modify these variables within the loop.

### Final State:
State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 2\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces if `len(lst)` is not 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `0`, `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`**
