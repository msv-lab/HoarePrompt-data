The code `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` adds the minimum of the first and second elements of `lst` (converted to integers) to `ans`. Let's break this down step-by-step:

1. From the initial state:
   - `total` is 10
   - `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 2\)
   - `l` is a string input by the user
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, but only if `len(lst)` is not 2
   - `ans_f` is a list containing `0`
   - `ans` is `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`

2. Since `ans` is initially set to `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, and `lst` is a list of strings split from `l`, the value of `ans` is already calculated and stored.

3. The code modifies `ans` by adding the minimum of the first and second elements of `lst` (again converted to integers). Since `ans` was initially set to `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, adding `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` to `ans` results in doubling the value of `ans`.

Therefore, the updated state of `ans` is `2 * ans`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 2\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces if `len(lst)` is not 2, `ans_f` is a list containing `0`, `ans` is `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`**
