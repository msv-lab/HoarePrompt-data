To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information step by step:

1. **Variable `t`:**
   - `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `ans_f`, which is a list containing `t` elements.

2. **Variable `ans_f`:**
   - `ans_f` is a list containing `t` elements, each representing the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` until the conditions of the loop no longer hold.
   - For the loop to execute, `ans_f` must contain at least one element.

3. **Variable `n`:**
   - `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration.

4. **Variable `i`:**
   - `i` is defined as `n * 2 + k`, where `k` is the number of times the loop did not execute due to the condition `len(lst) == 2`.
   - This variable is used as the index to access elements in `ans_f`.

5. **Variable `l`:**
   - `l` is the string input by the user for each iteration.

6. **Variable `lst`:**
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions.
   - The loop conditions affect the length of `lst`.

7. **Variable `ans`:**
   - `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements in `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less.
   - This variable is part of the loop body but not directly affecting the loop's execution.

Given these points, the key aspects to consider for ensuring the loop can execute are:

- `ans_f` must contain at least one element to ensure the loop can iterate.
- `i` must be within the bounds of `ans_f`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure `ans_f` has at least one element and `i` is valid.

**State:**
**`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans_f` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration, `i` is within the bounds of `ans_f`, `l` is the string input by the user for each iteration, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions, `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements in `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less.**
