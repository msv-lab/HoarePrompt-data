The code `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` adds the minimum value of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to `ans`. The initial state of `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` plus the minimum of the elements in `lst` if the original `lst` had two elements, otherwise `ans` is twice the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.

Since `ans` already includes the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, adding this value again means that `ans` is now double the initial value of `ans`. The values of `t`, `n`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is double its initial value, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is \(n * 2\)**
