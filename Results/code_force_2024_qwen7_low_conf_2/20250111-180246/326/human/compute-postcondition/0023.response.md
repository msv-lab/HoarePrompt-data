To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the for loop statement step by step.

### Given Information:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `ans` is calculated based on the conditions:
  - If `lst` has exactly two elements, then `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` plus the minimum of the elements in `lst`.
  - If `lst` has only one element, then `ans` is twice the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, which simplifies to just twice the single element.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration (`i = i + 1`).
- The loop runs for `n * 2` iterations.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for i in range(n * 2):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `i < n * 2`.
2. **Increment of `i`**: After each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).

### Step-by-Step Adjustment:
1. **Initial State**: At the end of the previous iteration:
   - `t` is within the range \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
   - `ans` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned above.
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.
   - `i` is one less than the number of iterations needed to complete the loop, i.e., `i = (n * 2) - 1`.

2. **Next Iteration**: For the loop to execute one more time:
   - `i` must be less than `n * 2`.
   - Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, the new value of `i` should be `i + 1`.
   - Therefore, the new value of `i` is `(n * 2)`.

### Updated State:
- `t` remains unchanged since it is not affected by the loop.
- `ans` remains unchanged since it is not directly modified within the loop.
- `n` remains unchanged since it is not modified within the loop.
- `i` is updated to `n * 2`.

### Final State:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the same as the previous value, `n` is the same as the previous value, `i` is \(n * 2\)**.

So, the final state is:
State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` plus the minimum of the elements in `lst` if the original `lst` had two elements, otherwise `ans` is twice the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is \(n * 2\)**.
