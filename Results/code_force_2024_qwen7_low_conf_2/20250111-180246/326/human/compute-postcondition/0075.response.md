Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, and `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, certain elements of `lst` are modified as described in the if part; otherwise, no additional modifications are made to `lst` beyond its initial state.***
