According to the given code, the loop iterates over the elements in `ans_f`. The loop condition for execution is whether `i` is within the bounds of `ans_f`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\),
- `ans_f` is a list containing at least one element,
- `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration,
- `i` is within the bounds of `ans_f`,
- `l` is the string input by the user for each iteration,
- `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions,
- `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements in `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less,
- `i` is printed.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be within the bounds of `ans_f`. Since `i` is already within the bounds of `ans_f` at the end of the previous iteration, the only thing that needs to change is the value of `i` to the next element in `ans_f`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans_f` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 (the next element in `ans_f`), `l` is the string input by the user for each iteration, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions, `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements in `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less, and `i` is printed.**
