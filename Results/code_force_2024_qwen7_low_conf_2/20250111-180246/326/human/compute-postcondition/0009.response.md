`ans` is incremented by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. Since the initial value of `ans` is 0, it will be updated to the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is equal to the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `lst` is a list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2**
