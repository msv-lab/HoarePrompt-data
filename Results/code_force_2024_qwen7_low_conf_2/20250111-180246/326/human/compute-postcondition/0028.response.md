The `break` statement does not change the values of the variables but instead breaks out of the current loop or conditional block. Since there is no loop or conditional block in the given code, the only impact is that we break out of the most internal loop or conditional block we were inside. However, since no loop or conditional block is specified, we consider the general impact of the `break` statement.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)
- `ans` is 3 times the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `i` is \(n * 2\)

The code `break` does not change any of these values. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is 3 times the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is \(n * 2\) and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
