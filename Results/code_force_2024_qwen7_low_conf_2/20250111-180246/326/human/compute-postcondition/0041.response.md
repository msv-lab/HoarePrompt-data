`lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the third element from the list `lst`. The initial state is such that `lst` has one fewer element than its original length, and its first element was removed. Since `lst` has one fewer element, the index `1 * 2` (which is 2) refers to the third element in the adjusted list. The removal of this element does not affect the values of `total`, `i`, `n`, `l`, `ans_f`, or `ans`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1)\), `n` is an integer input by the user, `l` is a string input by the user, the length of `lst` is one less than before and the first element is removed, `ans_f` is `[0]`, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, the third element of `lst` is removed.**
