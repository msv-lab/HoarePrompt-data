The code `lst = l.split(' ')` splits the string `l` by spaces and assigns the resulting list of strings to the variable `lst`. This operation does not affect the values of `t`, `ans`, `n`, `l`, `lst`, or `ans_f` except updating `lst` with the split result. The previous value of `lst` was a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans` is 0; `n` is the integer input by the user; `l` is the string input by the user; `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces; `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`.**
