Postcondition: ***`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is either 2 * `t` or 3 times the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` depending on the length of `lst`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is \(n * 2\). If the length of `lst` is not 2, `ans` is set to 2 * `t`. If the length of `lst` is 2, `ans` is set to 3 times the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.***
