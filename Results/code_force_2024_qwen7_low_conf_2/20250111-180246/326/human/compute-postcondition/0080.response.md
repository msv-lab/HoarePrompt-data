The code `ans += min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` impacts the variable `ans`. Initially, `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. The code adds the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` to `ans`.

Given the initial state:
- `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\)
- `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`
- `n` must be at least 1
- `l` is the string input by the user
- `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces
- `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`
- `i` is `n * 2`

After executing the code:
- `ans` will be updated to its current value plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`.
- All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans` is the updated value of the original `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`; `n` must be at least 1; `l` is the string input by the user; `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces; `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`; `i` is `n * 2`.**
