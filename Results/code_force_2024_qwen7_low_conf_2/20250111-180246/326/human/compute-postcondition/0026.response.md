The code removes the element at index `2` from the list `lst`. The initial state indicates that `lst` has had its first element removed, so the index `2` refers to the third element in the list (since list indices start at 0).

Given that `lst` has already had its first element removed, the code now removes the third element from the list.

- `t` remains an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `ans` is double its initial value, which means `ans = 2 * t`.
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `i` is \(n * 2\), so `i = 2 * n`.
- `lst` has had its first element and third element removed.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is 2 * `t`, `n` is a non-negative integer, `i` is 2 * `n`, and the first and third elements of `lst` have been removed.**
