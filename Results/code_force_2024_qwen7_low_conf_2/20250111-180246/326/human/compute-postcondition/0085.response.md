The code removes the element at index `0 * 2` (which is `0`) from the list `lst`. This means the first element of `lst` is removed. Let's consider the changes:

- `lst` originally had its first element removed.
- `ans` was previously updated to `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`.
- Since the first element is removed, the list indices shift, but `lst[0]` and `lst[1]` refer to the second and third elements of the original list respectively.
- `ans_f` contains `0` and the updated `ans`.

Since the exact values of `lst` and `ans` are not given, we'll keep them in terms of their relationships. The only direct change is that the first element of `lst` is removed.

Output State: **`lst` is `lst` without the first element, `ans` is `ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`, `ans_f` is `[0, ans + min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))]`, `i` is `n * 2 + 1`**
