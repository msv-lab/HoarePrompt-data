Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. Initial State:
   - `total` is 10
   - `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\)
   - `l` is a string input by the user (let's denote it as `user_input`)
   - `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed
   - `ans_f` is a list containing `0`
   - `ans` is the initial value of `ans_f[0]` plus the minimum of the first two integers in the modified `lst`

2. Code Execution:
   ```python
   lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])
   ```
   This line removes the element at index `2` (since `1 * 2` evaluates to `2`) from the list `lst`.

3. Impact on Variables:
   - The value of `total` remains unchanged, so `total` is still 10.
   - The value of `i` remains unchanged, so `i` is still \(2(n + 1) + 1\).
   - The value of `l` remains unchanged, so `l` is still the user input string.
   - The value of `lst` is modified by removing its third element (index 2). The new value of `lst` depends on the original content of `lst`.
   - The value of `ans_f` remains unchanged, so `ans_f` is still `[0]`.
   - The value of `ans` is determined by the initial value of `ans_f[0]` plus the minimum of the first two integers in the modified `lst`. Since `lst` is modified, the values in `lst` will affect `ans`.

Since the exact content of `lst` is not specified, let's assume `lst` was originally `['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']` for illustration purposes. After removing the third element, `lst` becomes `['a', 'b', 'd']`.

- The minimum of the first two integers in `['a', 'b', 'd']` would be `min(1, 2)` (assuming `a` and `b` are converted to their respective integer values).

Therefore, `ans` would be `0 + min(1, 2) = 1`.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 1\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings with its third element removed, `ans_f` is [0], `ans` is 1**
