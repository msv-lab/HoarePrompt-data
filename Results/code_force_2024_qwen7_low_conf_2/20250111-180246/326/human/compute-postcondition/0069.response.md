`ans` is incremented by the minimum value between `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. The previous value of `ans` is 0, so `ans` becomes the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`. The length of `lst` is not equal to 2**
