`lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index 2 from the list `lst`. Initially, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed. Since the index is calculated as `1 * 2`, which is 2, the third element (if it exists) of the list `lst` is removed. 

Given the initial state:
- `total` is 10
- `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 2\)
- `l` is a string input by the user
- `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed
- `ans_f` is [0]
- `ans` is `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))` if `lst` has at least two elements, otherwise `ans` is undefined

After removing the element at index 2 from `lst`, the value of `lst` changes, but since no new value is assigned to `lst`, the list itself remains as a list of strings with the third element removed. The value of `ans` depends on the elements in `lst` after the removal. If `lst` now has less than two elements, `ans` remains undefined.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 2\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces with the first element removed and the third element (if it exists) removed, `ans_f` is [0], `ans` is undefined**
