Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1) + 2\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces. If `len(lst)` is not 2, `lst` has the first and, if present, the third element removed, `ans_f` is [0], and `ans` is undefined. Otherwise, `lst` remains as split by spaces, `ans_f` is [0], and `ans` is `2 * min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))***
