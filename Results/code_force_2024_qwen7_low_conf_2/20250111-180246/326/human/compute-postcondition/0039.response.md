`ans` is assigned the value of `min(int(lst[0]), int(lst[1]))`. Since `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, the first two elements of `lst` are converted to integers and their minimum value is added to `ans`. The value of `total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1)\), `n` is an integer input by the user, and the length of `lst` is not equal to 2 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1)\), `n` is an integer input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0`, `l` is a string input by the user, the length of `lst` is not equal to 2, `ans` is the sum of `ans` and the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers.**
