The code snippet `ans_f.append(ans)` appends the current value of `ans` to the list `ans_f`. Since `ans` is defined as the sum of `t` and the minimum values of all pairs of elements from `lst` until the conditions of the loop no longer hold, and `ans_f` was initially a list containing `0`, appending `ans` to `ans_f` will add the current value of `ans` to the list.

The variables `t`, `n`, `i`, and `l` are not affected by this line of code, and the variable `lst` remains unchanged as well. The only change is in the list `ans_f`, which now contains two elements: `0` and the current value of `ans`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of all pairs of elements from `lst` until the conditions of the loop no longer hold, `n` is the integer input by the user, `i` is \(2(n + 1)\), `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, and `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans` is the sum of `t` and the minimum values of all pairs of elements from `lst` until the conditions of the loop no longer hold; `n` is the integer input by the user; `i` is \(2(n + 1)\); `l` is a string input by the user; `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces; `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`.**
