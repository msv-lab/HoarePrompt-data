Postcondition: ***`total` is 10, `i` is \(2(n + 1)\), `n` is an integer input by the user, `l` is a string input by the user, `lst` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces, `ans_f` is a list containing `0`. If the length of `lst` is not 2, the first element of `lst` is removed, `ans` is updated to include the sum of `ans` and the minimum of the first two elements of `lst` converted to integers, and the third element of `lst` is removed. If the length of `lst` is exactly 2, `ans` is updated to include the minimum of the integers converted from `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`.***
