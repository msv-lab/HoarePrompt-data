Postcondition: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` plus the minimum of the elements in `lst` if the original `lst` had two elements, otherwise `ans` is twice the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is \(i + 1\). `lst` is a list of either two or one element (depending on the if condition).**
