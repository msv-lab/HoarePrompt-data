The code `t = int(input())` reads an integer from input and assigns it to the variable `t`. Since the initial state specifies that `t` is an integer such that `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`, after executing this line, the value of `t` will be the integer inputted by the user, and it will still satisfy the condition `1 ≤ t ≤ 5000`.

The other variables (`n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_{2n}`) remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`t` is an integer inputted by the user and satisfies 1 ≤ t ≤ 5000, `n`, `a_1`, `a_2`, ..., `a_{2n}` remain unchanged**
