Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans_f` is a list containing `t` elements, each element representing the sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements from `lst` until the conditions of the loop no longer hold, `n` is the integer input by the user for each iteration, `i` is `n * 2 + k` where `k` is the number of times the loop did not execute due to the condition `len(lst) == 2`, `l` is the string input by the user for each iteration, `lst` is the list of strings obtained by splitting `l` by spaces and modified according to the loop conditions, `ans` is the cumulative sum of the minimum values of pairs of elements in `lst` until the length of `lst` becomes 2 or less.**
