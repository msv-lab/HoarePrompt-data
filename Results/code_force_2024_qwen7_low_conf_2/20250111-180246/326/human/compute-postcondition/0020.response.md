`ans` is assigned the value of `ans` plus the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`. The value of `i` is already updated to `i + 1` from the previous state. Since `i` is less than `n * 2`, it remains valid.

Given that `ans` is initially the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, and the code updates `ans` by adding the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])` again, the new value of `ans` will be double the initial value of `ans`.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is twice the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` is a non-negative integer, and `i` is \(i + 1\). `lst` is a list of either two or one element (depending on the if condition).**
