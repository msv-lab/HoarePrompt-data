According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop runs for `n * 2` iterations. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer. Additionally, since `t` is already defined as an integer within a specific range and `ans` is initialized to 0, these states do not need adjustment.

Let's break down the required adjustments:

1. `t` is given as an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\). This does not affect the loop's execution directly.
2. `ans` is 0. This also does not affect the loop's execution.
3. `n` is an input integer. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer (since negative values would result in a non-terminating or undefined behavior).

Given these considerations, we need to ensure that `n` is a non-negative integer for the loop to execute.

State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is 0, `n` is a non-negative integer, `lst` is a list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces**
