The code `lst.remove(lst[1 * 2])` removes the element at index `0` from the list `lst`, since `1 * 2` equals `2` and the initial elements of `lst` are `lst[0]` and `lst[1]`. After removing `lst[0]`, the list becomes `lst = [lst[1]]`.

The other variables are not affected:
- `t` remains unchanged as it is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\).
- `ans` remains unchanged as it is double the minimum of `int(lst[0])` and `int(lst[1])`, which is now only dependent on `lst[1]`.
- `n` remains unchanged as it must be at least 1.
- `l` remains unchanged as it is the string input by the user.
- `lst` is updated to `[lst[1]]`.
- `ans_f` remains unchanged as it contains `0` and `ans`.
- `i` remains unchanged as it is `n * 2`.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\), `ans` is double the minimum of `int(lst[1])` and `int(lst[1])`, `n` must be at least 1, `l` is the string input by the user, `lst` is the list containing a single element `lst[1]`, `ans_f` is a list containing `0` and `ans`, `i` is `n * 2`.**
