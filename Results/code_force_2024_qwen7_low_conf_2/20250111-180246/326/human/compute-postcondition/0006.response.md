The code splits the string `l` into a list of strings using spaces as delimiters. This affects the variable `l`, converting it into a list stored in `lst`. The values of `t`, `ans`, and `n` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`t` is an integer such that \(1 \leq t \leq 5000\); `ans` is 0; `n` is an input integer; `lst` is a list obtained by splitting `l` by spaces**
